                    "text": "\n\n''''s-Hertogenbosch''', commonly known as '''Den Bosch''', is a city in the south of the Netherlands and the capital of the province of North Brabant. Once a stronghold, vital in the protection of the young Dutch nation, Den Bosch has a charming and well-preserved medieval centre. Wander through the winding streets to see Saint John's Cathedral and then pick out a street terrace on the market square to relax with a chilling beer. Take a boat to see part of the unique Binnendieze, a subterranean network of canals under the city, or head to the south part of town where the ancient ramparts still mark the border of the city and the beginning of a natural reserve area. In short: what Den Bosch lacks in fame, it makes up for in charm. A place well worth visiting.\n\n==Understand==\n\nLocated where the rivers Aa and Dommel meet, the city of 's-Hertogenbosch became a city in 1184. It is one of the foremost cities of the historic Duchy of Brabant (1183 - 1794), which roughly consisted of the Dutch province of Noord-Brabant and large pieces of Flanders. Being one of the first cities founded in the Low Countries during the Mediaeval period, the charter which granted Den Bosch its city rights was subsequently used and adapted by a lot of other newly founded cities throughout the Low Countries.\n\n's-Hertogenbosch lends its name to the very Duchy it was once located in, meaning \"The Duke's forest\". Its shorter name, Den Bosch, is an abbreviation of said name. In other languages of mainland Europe, the name of the city is often translated (German: ''Herzogenbusch'', French: ''Bois-le-Duc''), which is fairly unique with Dutch cities.\n\nThe city holds significance for the Netherlands as a whole due to its siege of 1629 being a turning point for the Dutch revolution and the independence war that formed from said revolution. The city until that point had been considered to be impossible to successfully besiege, earning it the nickname ''De Moerasdraak'' (The Swamp Dragon). The capitulation of the city after a siege of half a year, gave stadtholder Frederik Hendrik the highest victory of his military career with him thusforth being known as ''De Stedendwinger'' (The subjugator of cities), but also led to an exodus of many Catholic citizens and clergy, as a reparation for the siege. \n\nThe population of Den Bosch is approximately 151,000 and with that it is reaching its limits, because almost all the ground available for building has been used. This does not mean that the whole area is one big city, as there are several (big) parks. Likewise, the southern edge of city is totally green as this is a protected natural reserve.\n\n\nDen Bosch can be seen in 9 regions (''note: these regions are built up of several neighborhoods''):\n\n* '''Center''' includes the whole area inside the city walls. Most sights and places to visit can be found in this area.\n* '''North''' is the area between the city center and the A59, which includes the neighborhoods ''de Rompert'', ''Orthen'', ''Herven'' and the area around the ''Prins Hendrik Park''.\n* '''Maaspoort''' is the area north of the A59. Mostly a residential area with some industry.\n* '''Hintham''' is the area around the FC Den Bosch football stadium.\n* '''South''' is the area between the city center and the A2 highway to the south. Residential, but with also a large amount of office buildings.\n* '''West''' is the area west of the central station. High presence of industry, as well as the residential neighborhoods ''Kruiskamp'' and ''Helftheuvel''. The ''Brabanthallen'' can be found here.\n* '''Engelen''' is the village of ''Engelen'' which is going through the development of ''Haverleij'', a combined residential complex on a golf course.\n* '''Rosmalen''', a town to the east of the A2.\n* '''Empel''', small village to the north of ''Rosmalen''.\n\nMost visitor attractions are found in the center, except for the footballstadium and the ''Sportiom''.\n\n\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By plane===\n* Amsterdam Airport Schiphol  (), the largest airport in the Netherlands and of Europe's most important intercontinental hubs, is roughly 1½ hr away from Den Bosch by train. The cost is  for the complete journey. There are multiple times an hour allowing such connections. Consult e.g. [http://9292.nl 9292.nl] for the most convenient option.\n* Eindhoven Airport  (), the country's second largest, is in Brabant and is mainly served by low-fare carriers from many European cities, with special emphasis on Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean. Getting to Den Bosch from Eindhoven is as simple as taking one of the many trains shuttling every hour between the cities, taking less than 20 minutes to connect them, but you must get a bus ride from the airport to Eindhoven station first, adding another 20 minutes to the travel time. With some walking and waiting factored it, the total journey time should not be over 50 minutes and will only cost you  in total.\n* Rotterdam The Hague Airport () is a smaller, business-focused airport in the city of Rotterdam, which can be used as an alternative to Schiphol from some destinations. The airport also does not have a direct train connection - you need to take the bus to Rotterdam Centraal (20 min) and then a direct Intercity train to 's Hertogenbosch. Total journey time is under two hours and cost is less than .\n\n\n\n===By train===\n\nDen Bosch has a good location within the railway system of the \"[http://www.ns.nl Nederlandse Spoorwegen]\" (Dutch Railroads) and almost every city has a direct connection or with a single stopover. Trains depart from Den Bosch main station in city center, which is located at the 'Stationsweg', towards Utrecht-Amsterdam-Haarlem and Utrecht-Schiphol in the north, in the direction of Nijmegen-Arnhem-Zwolle in the east, towards Eindhoven-Maastricht in the south and Tilburg-Breda-Roosendaal in the west.\n\n===By car===\nDen Bosch is accessible via the A2 highway, which was improved in 2016, alleviating the previously chronic traffic jams.\n\nThe major highway that passes Den Bosch is the A2, generally seen from Amsterdam to Maastricht. This one of the busiest highways of The Netherlands, and the part along Den Bosch, known as \"knooppunt Hintham\" and \"knooppunt Empel\" (intersection Hintham and Rosmalen), is in the top 5 of busiest traffic points in The Netherlands.\n\nThe other, less busy, highway passing Den Bosch is the A59, coming from Roosendaal (and the A16) towards Nijmegen. This highway is less busy than the A2, although traffic jams might occur when there is a jam on the A2 as the A59 merges into the A2 for a short part.\n\nNevertheless, if staying outside the peak hours, which are roughly from 07:00-09:00 and from 16:30–19:30, Den Bosch is easily accessible by car.\n\n===By bus===\nThe regional buses, operated by the BBA, link Den Bosch with Tilburg and Eindhoven. As these are the regional buses, they do not go directly between these city but stop at several small villages. Therefore, the fastest and advisable way is using the train.\n\n==Get around==\n\n\n\n===On foot===\nEverything within the city center is reachable by foot. Everywhere in the city, so also in the suburbs, are sidewalks. In the city center, most areas are accessible by foot and bicycle only, and traffic within the city is restricted.\n\n===By bus===\nThere is a free electric citybus that can take you from the central railroad station to the city centre and back.\nIf you want to go to the suburbs (where there is no reason to, as all points of interest are within the city center), Arriva operates a network of buses throughout the city and places in the vicinity. All buses arrive and depart from the central station, although for some lines it is not a terminus. Travelling on these buses is around  per zone, and you have to purchase at least 2 zones. You can either pay cash at the driver, or use an OV-chipkaart.\n\n\n===By car===\nThe city council is trying to get the city center car free, so it is bringing up all kind of measures to deter people from taking the car into the city. Cars can still be parked in the city center, but on Saturdays and Thursday evening these garages are packed. Parking is also available just outside the city center and from there buses are available every 15 minutes for only a few euros including bus trip.\n\n===By bike===\nThe best means of transportation is, just as in the rest of the Netherlands, by bicycle. The city is rather flat and bike friendly &lt;!-- I hope it's safe to assume it is--&gt;\n\n===Taxi===\nWhile taxis are relatively expensive in the Netherlands, they are typically reliable and can be good value if you're a small group. Taxis can be found in front of the train station and are available on call. Companies include  () and  (). They will also offer transportation services to other cities or towns in the region. While they will work by meter for trips inside the city, fixed prices are available for longer trips, e.g. to Eindhoven Airport (around ) or Schiphol (around ).\n\n\n\n==See==\n's-Hertogenbosch is a medieval city and among the oldest cities in the Netherlands. As the city center is historically protected there are still a lot of medieval buildings to be found. Wander around and see the traditional building style.\n\nWhen the Netherlands were still young it was a '''fortified city''' that served for the protection of the Netherlands. Especially on the south side of the city, a lot of these fortifications have been saved and over time restored. Start at ''Bastion Vught'' and walk northwards via the ''Parklaan'', ''Spinhuiswal'', ''Zuidwal'' and ''Bastion Oranje'' and ''Hekellaan'' until you reach the bridge over the ''Zuid Willemsvaart''. This way you cover the best part of the old fortifications. In 2004, the city was awarded ''European Fortress of the year''.\n\nHidden below the old city is a canal network called the '''Binnendieze''' that once stretched 22 km. It started out as a regular river, the Dommel, running through the city in medieval times but due to lack of space in the city, people started building their houses and roads over the river. In later times it functioned as a sewer and fell into disrepair. The remaining sixth of the old waterway system has been renovated, and it is possible to take several guided subterranean boat trips through it.\n\n* \n\n\n* \n\n\n* \n\n\n* \n\n\n* \n\n\n* \n\n\n* \n\n\n* \n\n\n\n==Do==\n\n* Take a boat on the Binnendieze, a river that goes below the houses of the center of town, which was used historically as an open sewer, but is now quite a special tour. There are several tours available. It is a popular tour so be aware when booking a time. Tickets can be bought at the Bolwerk which also have a beautiful café and a restroom free of charge.\n* \n*  of indoor space, which hosts many events, fairs, congresses and concerts year-round.\n}}\n**\n**\n\n==Buy==\nDen Bosch is a popular place for shopping, combining a charming historic atmosphere with a wide variety of stores. In the city centre you'll find all the major chains and department stores. For more characteristic speciality stores or small boutiques try the '''Snellestraat''' or the so-called '''Bossche Kwartier''', meaning the small streets around the Fonteinstraat. The '''Verwerstraat''', with its large monumental buildings, is the place to go for antiques, fashion and design. The '''Vughterstraat''' is another excellent pick, with clothing shops as well as some fine home decoration and furniture places.\n\n'''Markets''' are frequently held on the large market square. The main market is on Saturdays (09:00-17:00) and has a wide selection of food and non-food products. On Wednesday the selection is similar, but the market somewhat smaller. On Fridays, there's a biological market (09:00-14:00) with a good selection of high-quality, mostly regional products. There's another regular market on every first Sunday of the month, but it's a lot smaller than the one on Saturday.\n\n\n==Eat==\n\nThe city centre is packed with small and large restaurants that serve all kinds of crowds. The streets ''Korte Putstraat'' and the ''Lange Putstraat'' are your best bet if you're looking for a meal, as they have a particularly broad selection of places with nice outdoor terraces in summer. Typically you'll have no problems finding a table somewhere, but if you have a particular establishment in mind or if you want a good table on the terrace it's definitely wise to reserve ahead, as the best places are often full.\n\n===Budget===\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Mid-range===\n*\n* for a set 3-course menu\n| lastedit=31-08-2023\n| content=Popular with locals, this place gets good reviews and is often crowded.

It's a chocolate ball filled with cream, the size of a tennis ball, typically eaten with a cup of coffee in the afternoon but also for dessert. It makes for a fine sweet treat when you kick back and relax at one of the many cafés, after a day of walking through town.\n* for one pastry\n| lastedit=2022-10-05\n| content=This bakery is particularly well-known for its Bossche bollen and caters to many of the cafés in town.

This hotel is located in a business area but lies next to a small lake, which gives it its charm. It's about a 20-minute walk from the city centre and easily accessible by car. The large parking has electric car charging options. Bicycle rent is also available and there's a bus stop 200 meters away, with connections to the city centre.\n}}\n*\n| checkin=14:00 | checkout=11:00\n| content=\n}}\n*\n| checkin= | checkout=\n| content=\n}}\n*\n*\n*\n| checkin= | checkout=\n| content=\n}}\n\n==Connect==\nDen Bosch uses the area code 073.\n\n==Stay safe==\nDen Bosch is in general a safe city. Even the neighborhoods considered dangerous by the locals are still quite safe during daylight (''Hambaken'', ''Graafsewijk'' and ''Kruiskamp''). If a traveler uses his common sense he will be alright, also during night. The only time the crowd can get a bit rough is during Thursday, Friday and Saturday night. These are the general party nights, so people sometimes drink too much. Watch out to the drunk people that might easily start brawls (especially during the carnival).\n\n==Go next==\nWell connected and at a fairly central location, there are endless options for next destinations when leaving 'sHertogenbosch. Some of the more prominent nearby places are Utrecht, Tilburg, Eindhoven, Breda and Nijmegen. Families will find fun all year round at the Efteling, the country's largest theme park. The Loonse en Drunense Duinen National Park is also a short ride away.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

                    "text": "\n\nThe '''88 Temple Pilgrimage''' (八十八ヶ所巡り ''hachijūhakkasho-meguri'') is Japan's most famous pilgrimage route, a 1,200-km loop around the island of Shikoku.\n\n==Understand==\n\nMany of the temples are said to have been founded or restored by the revered monk and scholar '''Kūkai''' (空海), better known by his posthumous title '''Kōbō Daishi''' (弘法大師). Among his many achievements, he is said to have created the ''kana'' syllabary, brought the tantric teachings of Esoteric Buddhism from China, developed it into the uniquely Japanese Shingon sect, and founded Shingon's headquarters on Mount Koya near Osaka.\n\nWhile most modern-day pilgrims (an estimated 100,000 yearly) travel by tour bus, a small minority still set out the old-fashioned way on foot, a journey which takes about six weeks to complete.  Pilgrims, known as ''o-henro-san'' (お遍路さん), can be spotted in the temples and roadsides of Shikoku clad in a white jacket emblazoned with the characters ''Dōgyō Ninin'' (同行二人), meaning \"two traveling together\"—the other traveler being the spirit of Kobo Daishi.\n\nLocals will be excited to see someone making the journey on foot, and priests will be relieved that you are not showing up with 100 of your close friends. Make sure that your Japanese is good enough to communicate your feelings to both groups!\n\n==Prepare==\n]]\nCompleting the course the traditional way on foot is a serious undertaking that demands several weeks. Good physical fitness and stamina are required to endure the stress of constant walking up and down the hills of Shikoku, in the burning sun and the pouring rain.\n\nMany pilgrims choose to dress up in traditional white attire:\n\n* ''byakue''&amp;nbsp;– the white coat of a pilgrim\n* ''wagesa''&amp;nbsp;– scarf worn around the neck, usually purple, to indicate that you are on a religious pilgrimage\n* ''sugegasa''&amp;nbsp;– conical straw hat\n* ''kongōtsue''&amp;nbsp;– walking stick, and the one indispensable sign that identifies you as a pilgrim\n\nIn addition, most pilgrims carry a book called ''nōkyōchō'' or ''shuincho'', to collect a red ink stamp (shu-in) by each temple you visit, and hundreds of ''osame fuda'' (long slips of paper with your name and explanation of your pilgrimmage, to be left at each temple and given to each person who helps you; for your first trip, the paper should be white).  All of these items can be purchased (in a formal sense) at Mount Koya or at Ryozenji, the first temple.\n\nMany pilgrims who begin the pilgrimage on foot do not finish it. Many pilgrims also split up their trips over multiple years. It is common to hear of people giving up in Kochi, traditionally known as \"devil's land\" because of its hot temperature, intense rain, and infrequent contact with civilization. (This means you must either camp, sleep in a rest stop, or precisely time your journey to only hit towns and be willing to pay up for a hotel room.) Pilgrims who intend to walk the pilgrimage should ensure they have packed adequate supplies, such as rain gear, in addition to pilgrimage gear.\n\nIt is also important to factor costs. Costs include larger expenses, such as nightly lodging, as well as frequent smaller expenses, like the small charge at each temple to stamp your record book.  Former pilgrims that have walked the Shikoku Pilgrimage have shared cost calculators:\n\n* [http://www.shikokuhenrotrail.com/shikoku/planningCost.html Shikoku Henro Trail]\n* [https://www.jpilgrim.com/shikoku/costs.html JPilgrim]\n* [https://followingthearrows.com/2014/12/07/expenses-how-much-did-it-actually-cost/ Following the Arrows]\n\n=== Blog ===\n\n* Grace, \"[https://henro2009.wordpress.com Henro 2009]\" (2009).

It is not necessary to start at temple #1 as long as you visit them all, but this is by far the most popular starting point for pilgrims from outside Shikoku, because it is also the closest to people coming from Mt. Koya.　\n\nThe temples are usually visited in clockwise order, although this too, is just a convention—in practice, as all signs are oriented for pilgrims going clockwise, it's easier to get lost if you try to go against the flow.\n\n==Go==\n\nMost pilgrims walking on foot average around 25&amp;nbsp;km daily and complete the trip in five to seven weeks.\n\nThe canonical list of temples is as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

(番外 ''bangai'') temples.\n\n==Sleep==\n\n* There are many small inns that cater to pilgrims traveling either by foot or car. They typically cost between ¥4000-7000 per night, including dinner.\n\n* Most temples provide lodging for henro, but it can be quite expensive (around ¥8000 per night is average).\n\n* \"Henro houses\" are run by families or local businesses, and offer rooms (and sometimes food) to walking henro for a very small fee—or sometimes for free.\n\n* There are also small free lodgings called ''zenkonyado'' and ''tsuyado'' that lodge travelers for the night, although these lodgings can be somewhat poor quality and have very limited facilities. (There is a ''zenkonyado'' near Zentsuji which is said to be haunted.) These were once the primary lodgings for walking henro; however, the island's culture has changed in the last 50 years, and the number of these lodgings have been reduced to just a handful.\n\n'''Blogs listing cheap or free pilgrim accommodation:'''\n\n* [https://followingthearrows.com/2014/09/22/list-of-free-or-cheap-accommodation/ Following the Arrows]\n\n==Stay safe==\n\nTraveling in Shikoku is very safe, especially when you wear the traditional henro robes. People will be very helpful if they recognize you as a pilgrim, and will try to participate in your journey by giving you small gifts (''osettai''), which you must always accept.\n\nThe weather can be perilous at times; even during the optimal seasons of spring and fall, it may rain for days—particularly in the south. Proper preparation and staying up to date with weather reports is a must. You are, however, never far from civilization in case of emergency.\n\nBe careful while walking in Kochi Prefecture, as it is the least populated. The major towns are far apart, and the coast is lined with small fishing towns that tend to shut down by eight or nine in the evening, making it difficult to find accommodations.\n\nShikoku is home to many Dangerous snakes|snakes, including deadly pit vipers. When walking through brush or grass, stomping or otherwise making noise will divert most snakes from your path.\n\nJuly and August are very hot, and attempting to walk the pilgrimage at the peak of summer is asking for a bad case of Hot weather|heatstroke. But for the brave, it can mean small crowds and almost guaranteed space at the henro houses. April and October are the best times to go, though accommodations will be particularly crowded.\n\n==Go next==\nIn one tradition you aren't done when you reach the 88th temple—some believe you still have to trek back to the 1st to complete your pilgrimage! Another tradition suggests that closing the circle is not necessary and it is better to leave it open ended. However it is more common nowadays to return to the 1st temple.\n\nAlso if you've made it this far, it's only good manners to return to Mount Koya to give your thanks to Kobo Daishi.\n\n==Other pilgrimage routes in Japan==\n* Chugoku 33 Kannon Temple Pilgrimage - If you have the energy, you can easily begin this pilgrimage right after the Shikoku pilgrimage\n* Narrow Road to the Deep North - Trace the steps of the famous poet Matsuo Basho\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Known as ''Aix-la-Chapelle'' in French and ''Aken'' in Dutch, the city has played a prominent role in early Medieval Europe, when it became the favoured residence of Charlemagne, the first Holy Roman Emperor who created the Carolingian Empire in the late 8th and early 9th century and built the city's impressive cathedral, where he is now buried along with a succession of later German rulers, many of whom were also crowned in the city.\n\nApart from its medieval significance and a wealth of preserved artifacts, Aachen is also known for its springs, which have been attracting visitors since the Ancient Roman times and continue to do so today, with a number of historic baths and hotels sprinkled around the city. Contributing to the city's wealth and prominence is also the technical university, which made Aachen a hub for modern technologies and provides a sizeable student population (over 40,000 of the total 250,000 inhabitants in 2020). With all this, Aachen is now a multi-cultural, popular tourist destination.\n\nHistorically this spa-town was a prominent city, the place where the German Kings were crowned, and a famously favoured residence of Charlemagne who still lies buried in the impressive cathedral he himself had built. The city is packed with historic sights that remind of those days, including medieval buildings, city gates and beautiful fountains.\n\n\n\n==Understand==\nAachen was the preferred residence of Charlemagne,  \"Roman\" Emperor from 800 to 814 AD and king of an empire covering much of modern-day Italy, France, Germany and the Benelux. Additional information can be found at the [http://www.route-charlemagne.eu/Startseite/index.html?lang=EN Route Charlemagne Aachen] website.\n\nAs Aachen is a legally recognised spa, it could call itself Bad Aachen, but refuses to do so, as it then would no longer be first in almost all alphabetical lists.\n\nThe city lies at the borders of Germany with Belgium and the Netherlands, forming the economic region called the '''Euregio Maas-Rhein'''. There are several Euregios in Europe, but regionally speaking just of \"the Euregio\" is understood to mean the one centred on Aachen.\n\n==Get in==\n\n\n===By plane===\nAachen shares its '''[https://www.maa.nl/en/ Maastricht-Aachen airport]''' () with Maastricht. It is located some 40&amp;nbsp;km outside the city centre, in the Netherlands. Maastricht-Aachen airport is connected to only a limited number of international destinations and served by budget carriers. Transit to and from the airport via public transportation is only possible via the city of Maastricht.\n\nThe nearest major international airports are [https://www.dus.com/en Düsseldorf] () and [https://www.cologne-bonn-airport.com/en/index.html Cologne-Bonn] (). Both airports can be reached by train (via the Düsseldorf and Cologne central stations respectively) or car in an hour. Another major airport within close proximity is Brussels (). It can be reached by train with a change either in Liège, Leuven/Louvain, or Brussels.\n\nSmaller airports within reasonable distance are Weeze () in Germany, Eindhoven airport () in the Netherlands, and \"Brussels\" South Charleroi Airport () in Belgium. All three airports are bases for low-cost airlines. They can be reached by car in roughly 1h30, or by lengthy train journeys with several changes. Also, [https://www.liegeairport.com/passenger/fr/ Liège (Lüttich) airport] (( in Belgium is 45min by car and has some charter flights. Finally, Antwerp airport|https://www.antwerp-airport.com/ (), also in Belgium, requires a 90-minute car ride. Aachen is probably unique in having 9 airports in 3 countries within 150&amp;nbsp;km.\n\nIf for some reason none of the nearby airports are feasible or affordable, the airport in Frankfurt airport|Frankfurt (), Germany's main hub, has a direct ICE connection and offers a number of trains to Aachen with one interchange or less.\nFor some airports the rail&amp;fly programme the German railways offer together with several airlines might be an option. For more on that see rail air alliances.\n\n===By train===\nImage:Aachen Hauptbahnhof 10-2017.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Aachen central station (Hauptbahnhof)\n is the main railway station. Aachen has four other minor stations: Aachen Rothe Erde, Aachen Schanz, Aachen West and Aachen Eilendorf. In case of doubt, Aachen Hauptbahnhof is the most convenient station as it is served by all trains going to and through Aachen regardless of destination and it is closest to the city center.\n* '''[http://www.eurostar.com Eurostar]''' and '''[http://www.bahn.com ICE]''' trains directly connect Aachen internationally with Liège, Brussels and Paris. ICE trains also provide direct connections every two hours from Frankfurt via Cologne, and daily connections from Berlin via Hanover and occasional connections to Hamburg. \n* '''[https://www.flixtrain.com/ Flixtrain]''' serves the city.\n* There are also '''local trains from Liège''' every two hours.\n* '''Local trains''' (''Regionalexpress'') from Siegen via Cologne and Hamm via Düsseldorf run every half hour and take around 55 minutes from Cologne, 85 to 110 minutes from Düsseldorf.\n* '''Regional trains''' from Maastricht serve Aachen via Heerlen, Landgraaf and Herzogenrath (1 hr, )\n* '''[http://www.nightjet.at Nightjet]''', the Austrian Railways' sleeper train, runs twice a week from Brussels via Aachen to Vienna, Munich and Innsbruck. It calls at Cologne, Bonn, Koblenz, Frankfurt airport, Würzburg and Nuremberg where the train divides: one portion runs via Linz to Vienna, the other via Munich to Innsbruck.\n\n===By bus===\nAachen is connected by four bus operators for regional and long distance connections:\n* ).

There is also [http://www.aachen.de/en/ts/50_how_to_get_to/50_80/50_80_30/index.html park and ride] available around the outskirts of the town.\n\nIf you don't have your own vehicle, car-sharing is a possibility. Car-sharing is very common in Germany, but you should of course be cautious when booking a trip nonetheless. [http://www.blablacar.de/ blablacar.de] and [http://www.mitfahrgelegenheit.de/ mitfahrgelegenheit.de] are good resources for finding rides to Aachen, although you're less likely to be successful if you're looking to book far in advance. Payment is expected.\n\n===By hitchhiking===\nThere are several conventient possibilities to hitchhike to and from Aachen. More details and recommendations are available in the [https://hitchwiki.org/en/Aachen Aachen article at hitchwiki].\n\n==Get around==\nThe old town is best explored on foot and orientation signs can be found all around. Apart from the centre, Aachen at a whole is a fairly large city.\n\n===By bus===\nAachen has a city bus system, operated by [http://www.aseag.de ASEAG], including a few night bus lines. Most buses run to the central bus station  near the city centre. You can get tickets from the bus driver. On arrival in Aachen, it may be worth visiting the ASEAG Customer-Centre opposite the main bus station. Here, you can pick up timetables for all bus routes run by the company and you can of course speak to an adviser as well. There are no timetables available for services run by Veolia, such as the number 50 to Maastricht, or for bus services run by Deutsche Bahn, such as the number 66 to Monschau.\n\n===By train===\nAachen does not have a tram, U-Bahn or S-Bahn network like many other large German cities. It is still possible to travel through the city by train. The euregio-Bahn is a local line that stops at the stations Aachen West (not far from RWTH Aachen University), Aachen-Schanz, Aachen Hauptbahnhof (the most convenient for the city centre) and Aachen-Rothe Erde. Ticket machines are available at all stations.\n\n===By car===\nThe city centre is mostly blocked for car traffic. A car can come in handy in the outskirts. Parking can get expensive, especially in the center of town.\n\n===By bike===\nWhile being hilly and not the most biker-friendly town in Germany, there are a number of bike routes and getting around on bike is increasingly popular. As in other German cities, some bike thefts have been reported so reasonable caution is adviced. Bike parking with surveillance is possible in [https://www.wabe-aachen.de/de/wabe-ev/arbeit-und-soziale-integration/beschaeftigungsprojekte/radstation-radwerkstatt \"fahrrad station\"], near the central train station.

Around 800, the core building of the Palace Chapel was built. During the 14th and 15th centuries, the Gothic choir (the \"Aachen glasshouse\"), the north and south chapel were added. Through the centuries, many other constructions and decorations were completed. Today, it is a unique and beautiful two-storey cathedral of classical pillars, bronze railings, golden masterpieces, glassworks, etc. The cathedral is the memorial and funeral place of Charlemagne (814).

When you're ready to pay, hand over your coaster to a member of staff. It's expected that you leave a small tip when paying; 5-10% is expected, typically by rounding up to the nearest Euro. You should make it clear you want to leave a tip before handing the money over by saying, for example, \"I'll pay \".\n\n\nThe '''Pontstraße''' begins at ''Markt'' facing the historic city hall and ends at the ''Ponttor'', part of the medieval city walls.

With a population of almost 350,000 in 2020, it is Denmark's second largest city and has the youngest population.\n\n==Understand==\n\n\nAarhus is known as \"The City of Smiles\" (Danish: ''Smilets By''). This slogan probably started as publicity to improve the city's image, but it has nevertheless caught on.\n\nBeing a university city and centre of education, Aarhus has a large student population and one of the lowest median ages of any city in Europe. The cultural scene here is always thriving. For years, Aarhus has been an incubator for Danish artists and performers. It is also home to '''[http://www.aarhusfestuge.dk Aarhus Festuge]''', Scandinavia's largest cultural festival, held annually for 10 days at the end of August. In addition, Aarhus, along with the East Jutland Metropolitan area for which it serves as the central hub, is the fastest-growing area in Denmark in terms of population. There is a huge building boom taking place with new high-rises sprouting like mushrooms on the skyline. Little wonder, then, that Aarhus was selected as 2017's European Capital of Culture, with a full slate of events on tap all year throughout the entire city and region.\n\n===Orientation===\n====Aarhus C====\n\nAarhus City is the central district and the most active area of the city with several interesting and special neighbourhoods, including these:\n* '''Indre by''' (Inner City) is the old medieval core of the city which used to be walled and gated up until 1857. A large part of the inner city is pedestrianized. The Latin Quarter is a small special quarter with cobblestone streets, low-rise buildings and old townhouses that has been preserved.\n* '''Vesterbro''', situated north and west of Indre by, is mostly a residential area. However, you'll find several major attractions including the Botanical Gardens, the Old Town museum and the main university campus.\n* '''Øgade-kvarteret''' is a residential quarter immediately northwest of the Latin Quarter and also presents a unique town environment with lowrise buildings and colourful townhouses, mostly from around the 1850s-1920s. Most of the streets of the quarter are named after Danish islands.\n* '''Aarhus Ø''' is a new residential neighbourhood on the harbourfront.\n* '''Trøjborg''' is located north of the inner city and is like a small town within the city. The area was developed in the early 1900s with mostly four- or five-storey apartment blocks in brick. It used to be a working class neighbourhood. It is a somewhat quiet residential quarter but also includes a central shopping street with restaurants and a cinema.\n* '''Frederiksbjerg''' is another quarter with its own charm and character. Located immediately south of the broad railway yard in the city centre, this area was developed primarily in the late 1800s and most of the original buildings have been preserved. It is a lovely mix of bustling street life, restaurants, specialty shops, small businesses and residential areas. Mostly low-rise buildings and townhouses, with several small parks in between.\n\n====Aarhus N====\n'''Aarhus Nord''' (Aarhus North) is a large postal district comprising the northern parts of the city. It is made up mostly of quiet residential neighbourhoods, but boasts natural attractions such as the Risskov urban forest, Egå Engsø lake area, and some beach parks. The district is also home to several educational institutions, a large business park, an industrial park with light industry, and a huge regional hospital. Some of the neighbourhoods in Aarhus N, like Skejby and Vejlby, are former suburban villages that have merged with the city.\n\n====Aarhus V====\n'''Aarhus Vest''' (Aarhus West) is perhaps the largest postal district and includes all the western neighbourhoods of the city. Most of it is residential areas of more recent development, but some neighbourhoods, like Åby and Hasle, are former suburban villages or outlying farms that have merged with the city. There are several natural attractions in this large area, including the Brabrand Lake area and the nature site of Skjoldhøjkilen, and many opportunities for sports.\n\n====Viby and Højbjerg====\n'''Viby''' (officially Viby J, with J for Jutland) is a former railway town that has merged with the expanding city. It is sometimes unofficially referred to as Aarhus S (Aarhus South) along with '''Højbjerg''', '''Skåde''' and '''Holme''', three adjacent districts and neighbourhoods. There is some activity around the central square of Viby Torv, but otherwise these southern parts of town are predominantly residential. Marselisborg Forests and the Moesgaard Museum are the two most important attractions here.\n\n=== When to go ===\n\n\nAs the seasons change, the character of Aarhus changes accordingly. In winter, outdoor activities are limited and this is primarily a time for the indoors. It is unusual for everything to be covered in metre- thick layers of snow and the temperatures are not excruciating cold normally, but daylight hours are limited, the trees stand bare, and the skies are often depressingly grey. While the city is still full of people, the outdoor street life is uninspiring for most visitors, except for the Christmas period of December. At this time, the city centre is decorated, and as Christmas approaches, more street vendors sell sweet treats and comfort food such as ''æbleskiver'', pancakes, mulled wine, and sugar-glazed almonds.\n\nStarting in Apr-May and ending with Oct-Nov, the city has more to offer. The beech trees burst into leaves around the first of May, and daylight hours and temperatures increase rapidly throughout this month. Having waited for this, citizens are quick to fill the parks and green spaces; street life shows much more intensity and diversity, and several outdoor events take place. However, Aarhus, as the rest of Denmark, is almost closed down with empty streets during Easter.\n\nMajor attractions in Aarhus are open throughout the summer, but quite a few restaurants are closed for several weeks, though not all at once; there are still plenty of opportunities. However, if you plan to visit a specific eatery, confirm their hours beforehand. In July and August, many residents leave the city or travel abroad. University students have time off from their studies and many visit family in other cities, work elsewhere, or travel. Working people have five weeks of paid vacation and nearly everybody spends some of it during this season. For these reasons, the city centre can appear deserted in mid-July to early August and chances are that you will encounter more visitors than residents. It would therefore be a good idea to combine a visit to Aarhus with excursions to nearby countryside and attractions in the height of summer. From mid-August, things start to happen again in the city as residents return. It is still summer and soon time for the annual Aarhus Fest.\n\nThrough September, the temperatures begin to cool and it gets windier, but there are still many daylight hours in the day and the weather is usually fine. From October the leaves on the trees start to turn yellow and red, and any trace of summer ends with the onset of November. September and October are also a good time to visit if you want to include outdoor and nature experiences to your trip, just bring more warm clothing. October and parts of November is a particularly beautiful time of year in the city parks and forests with all the vibrant colours of autumn.\n\n=== Tourist information ===\nAs most other places in Denmark, the official tourist website of Aarhus is managed by VisitDenmark, a public-private partnership with free tourist services. The Aarhus website is called [https://www.visitaarhus.com/ VisitAarhus].\n\nThe main office for tourist information in the city is in the #Miscellaneous|Dokk1 library building at the harbour front. Ask the staff at the information desk and they will help you. In the summer, extra staff servicing tourists specifically are there to help. There is also a touchscreen available with interactive tourist information about the city, and a plethora of free inspirational and informative pamphlets about notable sights and happenings in the region.\n\n==Talk==\nMany Danes can be reserved towards strangers, but friendly towards tourists, and will normally be happy to give you directions and advice in good English. As Aarhus is a big city, it will hardly be a problem getting help or directions in near-fluent English.\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By train===\n\n* \n\nIt is also possible to catch a train to other parts of the Jutland peninsula from Aarhus. There are trains going north to Aalborg twice an hour most days and going west to Skjern or Struer once an hour. Trains from Hamburg arrive several times a day (with a change of trains in Kolding). If you book about two months before travelling, you can buy one of the few tickets for €30 (called \"Europa-Sparpreis\"). For more information check out the website of the German national railway company [http://www.db.de DB]\n\nDSB introduced a mandatory reservation on trains to and from Germany in July 2019. Even though Denmark is in the Schengen area, passports are being checked by customs at entry points.\n\nTickets used in trains are also usable in buses, and if you are travelling from Copenhagen, you can use your ticket for the rest of the day to get around Aarhus at no extra expense.\n\n\n===By bus===\nBuses have become an attractive way of travelling between Aarhus and Copenhagen, due to their significantly lower prices. An inter-city bus takes roughly an hour longer than an equivalent express train, but the fares are typically between 40% (standard tickets) and 90% (the cheapest Saver tickets) lower than full-price train tickets.\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n===By boat===\n* \n* \n\n===By plane===\n\n*  | url=http://www.aar.dk | email=\n| address= | lat=56.304167 | long=10.619167 | directions=\n| phone= | tollfree=\n| hours= | price=\n| wikipedia=Aarhus Airport | image=Denmark-Aarhus Airport.JPG | wikidata=Q1341664\n| lastedit=2021-11-25\n| content=Aarhus Airport is rather small, but it is served by several major European airlines nonetheless.

The inner city has an extensive pedestrian zone, and almost every town road in Denmark has sidewalks. If you want to venture further out, several routes have been established for exercise and for leisurely strolls. Known as \"sunbeams\", they avoid heavily trafficked roads and includes nature experiences.\n\n===By bicycle===\nBicycles are easily available for rent in the central parts of town. In addition to the listings below some hotels have bikes available for rental by their guests.\n\nEven though Denmark is very flat generally, Aarhus has some of the steepest roads in the country and they can be quite a challenge if you aren't used to ride a bicycle. However, most roads are a breeze and on longer rides, you can usually plan your route to avoid the hardest ascends if you fear the \"Aarhusian Alps\".\n\nThe inner city of Aarhus has a network of bicycle streets (Danish: ''Cykelgader'') where priority is given to cyclists. Here bicycles can use the entire lane and cars are not supposed to drive faster than normal cycling speed. However not all drivers respect these rules (perhaps because they are unaware of them), so you should still watch out for car traffic.\n* \n* \n* y\n* \n* \n\n===By light rail===\n\nThe electric light rail system \"[http://www.letbanen.dk/ Aarhus Letbane]\" opened its first line in late 2017, as the first rail system of its kind in Denmark, and is bound for further expansions into the suburbs in coming years.\n\nTickets can be purchased with credit cards at electronic stands on selected stops, and the tickets are fully compatible with the local yellow bus system (and vice versa). Tickets cannot be purchased aboard the light rail train. Bicycles can be brought along for an extra fee, although not on the inner city stretch \"Skolebakken - Universitetshospitalet\" during weekday mornings and afternoon rush hour periods (07:00-09:00 and 15:00-17:00). The train schedules, important info, and the zoning system can be checked at the Letbanen website.\n\n===By bus===\n\nThere are two bus systems in Aarhus, both operated by [http://www.midttrafik.dk/ Midttrafik]. '''[https://www.midttrafik.dk/koereplaner/bybusser/aarhus.aspx Yellow buses]''' serve local routes within the city limits, and '''[http://www.visitaarhus.com/ln-int/letbanen-and-city-buses-gdk708590 Blue buses]''' serve municipal and regional routes. The blue bus routes pass through the inner city, so if you have to go on longer journeys, you do not have to change between the two systems. '''X-buses''' are express blue buses, discernible by a large X sign. X-buses make fewer stops, are equipped with free Wifi, usually have toilets and you are allowed to eat and drink. All blue buses have limited cargo space for heavy luggage, bicycles, etc., that you can use if you inform the chauffeur. You can enter the yellow city buses using all doors. On the blue regional buses entrance is at the front door only (with some exceptions, such as the 200 and 100).\n\n\nTickets are preferably purchased in advance in the Midttrafik app or in the Midttrafik webshop. The app is free for download on App Store and Google Play. Here you can buy single tickets, multi trip ticket cards, and special tourist tickets for busses and Letbanen. As a special service, blue buses also offers the opportunity to buy a ticket with cash from the chauffeur. Tickets bought on blue buses (and trains) can also be used to ride the local yellow buses, but not necessarily the other way around. If you ride without a valid ticket, you risk getting fined heavily, so don't take chances.   \n\n[https://www.midttrafik.dk/billetter-og-priser/ Bus tickets] for travel within the city limits are kr 22, or kr 11 if you are under 16 years of age.

Cheaper cards are also available for people under 16 years old. Finally, there are tickets that allow you to ride all you want for 30 days, with prices depending on how far you wish to travel. For planning trips, it is recommended to use [https://www.rejseplanen.dk/webapp Rejseplanen]; the official travel planner website for all Danish public transport.

The fare is double the normal price.\n\nIn all of Denmark, train tickets can also be used to ride local bus lines, if you get on the bus within the time limit on your ticket.\n\n===By taxi ===\n* \n* \n\n===By car===\nAarhus has very good public transit and in the inner city most sights are within walking distance of each other. A car is therefore really only needed if you want to explore the countryside. In addition, you will find that parking is restricted and rather expensive in Aarhus C. Free parking is scarce, except at a few places like Tangkrogen, in front of Ceres Park &amp; Arena and at some shopping centres.\n\nWhile traffic rarely comes to a complete standstill, the ring roads and inner city streets are often quite congested during rush hour. That being said, should you need a car while staying in Aarhus, there are several car rental companies with centrally located rental stations.\n\nRemember to yield to cyclists. Aarhus is a hilly city and cyclists going downhill will often be approaching intersections at high speed.\n\nThere is a low emission zone in Aarhus; see Driving in Denmark#Low Emission Zones.\n\n==See==\n\nMany attractions and events in Aarhus are free, and there is an interesting street life, so even on a budget you can have an enjoyable experience.\n\n===History===\nWith a history dating back to at least the 700s in the Viking Age, Aarhus holds many historic buildings, some of which are of national importance.\n\n*  for adults\n| wikipedia=Viking Museum (Aarhus) | wikidata=Q4992847\n| content=Small Vikings and Old Norse|Viking museum located across from the cathedral in the basement of the Nordea Bank.

There are many niche boutiques, cafés and restaurants.\n\nSeveral professional guides arrange historic walks around town.\n\n===Museums===\nThere are a lot of museums around Aarhus, and Denmark in general, but many of them are not museums in the ordinary sense, more like themed and interactive cultural centres. The three main museums in Aarhus are The Old Town museum, ARoS Art Museum and Moesgaard Museum.\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n*\n* \n*\n* \n* \n\n===Architecture===\n\n\n\nAnyone who appreciates European architecture will find many points of interest in Aarhus, from medieval buildings to modern icons. Even though Aarhus is one of the oldest towns in Denmark, most of the inner city was erected in the 1800s and 1900s during and after the industrial revolution, and you will not find many larger structures from the 1600s and 1700s, as compared to Copenhagen for example.\n\nModern architecture is abundant with many notable buildings such as the university campus in yellow brick, the futuristic Dokk1, the residential Isbjerget (The Iceberg) at the harbourfront, Musikhuset (the Concert Halls) and the Moesgård Museum from 2014. Notable architecture in the city also includes a bit of post-modernism, plenty Nordic functionalism, and in particular historicism which is abundant. The Aarhus Cathedral begun in the 1100s is the oldest building in the city, but there are several preserved Medieval timber-framed buildings, mostly in the inner city, with the oldest dating to the 1500s.\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n=== Green spaces and nature ===\nAarhus has a few large parks and several smaller green spaces. The largest and most notable parks includes the University Park, Aarhus Botanical Gardens and The Memorial Park.

Beachcombers might want to be on the lookout for petrified belemnites and sea urchins, but you shouldn't expect to spot any amber in this part of Denmark.\n\nThe municipality offers real-time updates of water quality, temperature, etc., at area beaches, on a [http://newostjylland.badevand.dk/?aakdom=http://www.aarhus.dk#home website] and via a free mobile app. Be aware that there is increased wave activity throughout the entire bay whenever the catamaran ferry is passing through. The phenomenon is harmless and only lasts 5-10 minutes, but small children are sometimes frightened by this, especially when it happens on an otherwise calm day.\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n=== Swimming pools ===\nThere are a total of [https://vigirbyenpuls.dk/svoemmehaller four public indoor swimming pools] throughout the city that can be used most of the year. Be sure to check up, as some are closed for extensive periods in the summer. Same price at all venues: kr 45; special prices for children and groups. You can rent towels and bathing suits at some places, but it is expensive.\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n=== Sports ===\nThroughout the city there are a number of sports complexes, small and large stadiums, [http://www.vigirbyenpuls.dk indoor sports halls], and several facilities for street sports. Apart from the free street-level activities, you'll need to be a member of a team to visit most of these places, but sometimes hourly rental or trial lessons are offered.\n\n* '''Football:''' [https://agf.dk/ Aarhus GF] play soccer in Superliga, Denmark's top tier.

The sea, coasts and countryside around Aarhus, present many opportunities for angling. Saltwater fish includes sea trout, cod, mackerel, herring, and flatfish. Sometimes migrating fish like garfish are plentiful, depending on the season. Freshwater fish in streams and lakes, includes trout, pike, perch, and in some places zander, roach or bream.\n\n=== Horse riding ===\nA few places offers horseback riding as an alternative way to experience the immediate countryside.\n* \n* \n* \n\n=== Golf ===\nThe East Jutland region has many options for golfers.

As the home of '''Aarhus University''', the largest in Scandinavia, plus nine other institutions of higher education, Aarhus' student population numbers one out of every five residents — a statistic that certainly explains the youthful vigor in the city's dining, nightlife, and cultural scenes.\n\nEven if you're not matriculated at any of Aarhus' colleges and universities, the city still offers a lot of informal learning activities and courses on all kinds of subjects.\n\n* Apart from degree courses,  (AU) also offers a number of independent academic courses in English, as well as...\n:*'''[http://fuau.dk/default.aspx# Folkeuniversitetet]''' (Folk University), which hosts lectures and seminars on many popular academic subjects, with a more relaxed and less technical tone aimed at laypeople. However, the ''teachers'' come from a rigorous academic background (many are professors at AU), and are equipped to deliver up-to-date knowledge from the forefront of research. All courses are in Danish, so this can be a good opportunity for you to exercise your language skills in an intellectually stimulating way.\n*'''[https://dokk1.dk/english Dokk1]'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;, a new central library and cultural centre, offers a plethora of cultural events, gatherings, seminars, and discussion groups with various cultural notables.\n* (Frederiksgade 78C) is a cluster of buildings tucked away in a courtyard behind City Hall Square that serves as a centre for a diversity of courses in general education, meetings and conferences.

The language courses here are mostly geared toward foreign students at Aarhus University and immigrants, but are open to all. Courses are held at both the LærDansk's offices (Paludan-Müllers Vej 82) and the AU campus.\n\n==Buy==\n\n\n\n\nThe '''pedestrian zone''' in the city centre is the best place for shopping — and it's right outside both Aarhus Central Station and the bus terminal, so you can't miss it. It's packed with small specialty boutiques and cafés, but you'll also find larger stores too: locations of '''Salling''' and '''Magasin du Nord''' department stores; three '''H&amp;M''' outlets; several supermarkets. The main street of '''Strøget''' is the place to go for upscale Scandinavian clothing, design and jewellery shops. There are also a number of larger bookstores where you can buy books in English, including guides and maps.\n\n* \n* \n* \n\nOutside the city centre, notable shopping opportunities include:\n\n* \n* \n* \n\nSelf-caterers on a budget should look for a yellow '''Netto''' or blue '''Rema'''; these are the most abundant discount grocery stores in the city. Another discount option is the less frequent green '''Coop 365''' stores.\n\nSome places, particularly restaurants, assess a surcharge of a few percent extra on purchases made with foreign credit cards, due to banking fees.\n\n==Eat==\n\n\nAarhus is generally known as one of the best places to eat in Denmark. However, the best places are not necessarily located at the most prominent addresses, so a bit of browsing is recommended if you have a particular interest in fine dining. Prices tend toward the low end — perfect for perennially cash-strapped university students — but that's not necessarily an indicator of low quality; you can find surprisingly good food at some of these budget-priced places. Several spots have lunch offers.\n\nWith an immigrant population of around 15%, Aarhus has many opportunities for ethnic food; Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai and Japanese food are the most common cuisines, and again, prices are usually quite affordable.\n\nMost restaurants close the kitchen at 21:00, but you can usually sit back and enjoy your meal for as long as you like. At gourmet spots, it is a good idea to book a table beforehand, and for groups of five or more people it is highly recommended. Otherwise, you risk being turned down in the door, due to the unexpected workload or lack of space. Many restaurants are closed for extensive periods throughout the year; usually in the summer months or Jan-Feb, so be sure to check in advance if you plan to visit a specific place.\n\n===Barbecue and burgers ===\nIn the last decade or so, Aarhus has experienced a veritable \"burger war\", with good quality burger joints popping up everywhere, making for strong competition. Middle Eastern fare such as kebab, shawarma and falafel can be had at numerous eateries in nightlife districts, and Aarhus has several choices for traditional Danish-style barbecue as well.\n\n====Budget====\nIn addition to what's listed below, no visit to Denmark would be complete without patronizing a ''Pølsevogn'' (sausage wagon): street vendors that sell a variety of hot dogs, sausages, and sometimes burgers. The inner city has several, including one in front of the central station and another at City Hall Square, most of which are owned by a Danish [http://www.bornenes-kontor.dk/ charity] that donates the surplus to needy children.\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==== Mid-range ====\n\n* \n* \n\n=== Mediterranean ===\n\nFrench and Italian fare is popular and easy to find around Aarhus, but the Mediterranean options also includes a few Spanish and Greek style restaurants.\n\n==== Budget ====\nPizzerias are abundant throughout the city, including the outlying districts. Some places puts in an extra effort:\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\nOther noteworthy places with budget options include:\n* \n\n==== Mid-range ====\n\nGood restaurants with a broader and more substantial Mediterranean menu include:\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n==== Splurge ====\n* \n* \n\n===Asian===\n\n====Budget====\nThere are many options for a budget-priced Asian meal. Chinese restaurants usually offer budget-priced lunch buffets, a few ''à la carte'' dishes, and takeaway boxes. Notable also is a cluster of Asian-style eateries in Nørregade.\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==== Mid-range ====\nSushi dominates the roster of mid-priced Asian restaurants in Aarhus, and there are many options. In addition, the following restaurants stands out in the Asian-style category:\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n=== International gourmet ===\nWhile gourmet dining in Denmark traditionally means French cuisine, the large and diverse slate of such restaurants in Aarhus also includes Italian and Spanish-inspired gourmet cooking, seafood restaurants, and New Nordic. Four places have been awarded a Michelin star and several are mentioned in respectable food guides, including the White Guide covering Nordic countries specifically.\n\nMost larger hotels have their own restaurant, usually with decent-quality international fare at mid-range prices, and some with outstanding dining. You don't have to have a room there to eat there. See the \"Sleep\" section or individual hotel websites for details. Further out into the countryside, traditional inns ''(kroer)'' also offer culinary experiences comprising both native Danish fare as well as international gourmet cuisine, again mostly at mid-range prices.\n\n====Mid-range====\n\nGreat quality international gourmet food can be had for mid-range prices. Even if your budget is limited to mid-range, do also check out \"Splurge\" restaurants, as more expensive places are known to offer special promotional discounts from time to time.\n\n* \n* \n\n==== Splurge ====\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n=== Steakhouses ===\nDenmark is well-known worldwide for its pork, but also produces topnotch beef. Many restaurants have steak on the menu, including some of the international gourmet spots, but a few places serve it as the specialty of the house. To enjoy the best possible steak in Aarhus, you will have to splurge.\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n=== Traditional Danish food ===\nUnlike the experimental and often quite expensive dining of the New Nordic Cuisine, traditional Danish food is hearty, simple, and of course old-school — and its popularity is surging on Denmark's restaurant scene these days. Special menus are served around ''Mortens Aften'' (St. Martin's Day; 11 November), Christmas, and Easter. Prices are mostly mid-range.\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n=== Vegetarian ===\nMany eateries in Aarhus have vegetarian dishes or alternatives on the menu. Only a few places are dedicated vegetarian only.\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n=== Cafés ===\nThe many cafés in Aarhus span a diverse range, from tiny holes-in-the-wall with two chairs to extravagantly decorated places with mirror rooms and waiters in fancy clothes. Some places serve only the most basic items, while other places offer lunch, evening dinners or cocktails and parties at night. So whatever you are looking for, it shouldn't be a problem to find a café that suits your taste or pocket.\n\n\nThe majority of cafés in Aarhus are unique, each with their own individual charm and character, and you'll find an emphasis on high-quality coffee in quite a few of them. However, national chain cafés also have a presence, with locations of '''Espresso House''', '''emmerys''', '''Lagkagehuset''' and '''Anettes Sandwich''' across the city, and '''Starbucks''' have two cafés in the inner city as well. If you're not a coffee drinker, cafés also often serve hot chocolate and sometimes smoothies, but quality tea is only just beginning to catch on around these parts.\n\nTake note that in almost all cafés in Denmark you are expected to contact staff yourself, usually at the desk, to grab a menu card, to place your order and when you wants to pay. This is often very bewildering to tourists, but is how things are typically done in Denmark and not a sign of rude or ignorant service.\n\nAlthough there is a high concentration in the inner city, cafés can be found all over town. A few special places might be hard to discover without particular mention:\n\n* \n* \n* \n*  focus on lightweight games while the spot in  presents more heavy and advanced games.\n}}\n\n=== Bakeries ===\nDenmark has a long tradition of unique, good quality Bread_and_confectionery#Nordic_countries|bread and confectionery. You might find it in cafés or in common bakeries across the city, but some places merit a visit for the special effort they put into the craft of baking.\n\n\n\n*  and  are two Danish chains of high-end bakeries with attached café sections. Lagkagehuset has seven spots across town and presents a great selection of cakes which, apart from the Danish pastries of course, include cold confectioners cakes such as layercakes and creamcakes. Emmerys is an organic certified bakery with five spots offering brunch servings, while the cake selection is more limited. Both chains offers breakfast and various snack foods and they are open every day of the week.\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Drink==\nAarhus has a lively nightlife, with everything from big mainstream clubs to small alternative hangouts playing niche music. Aarhus' young population fuels a major part of the partying, and the large numbers of students tend to keep prices reasonable. The legal age for buying alcohol in Denmark is 16 and 18 relative to the amount of alcohol present in a given drink, but some bars limit entry to those over 20 or even 23. In any case, it pays to have picture ID on you if you want to indulge in the bar scene. Prices are generally higher than in other parts of Europe, but cheaper than Copenhagen and with several budget options. Entry fees are almost non-existing. The action tends to concentrate around Jægergårdsgade, Frederiksgade, Åboulevarden, Vestergade, the Latin Quarter, Mejlgade, Nørregade, and the riverside ''(Åen)'', the latter of which is the most expensive area.\n\nThe nightlife in Denmark and Aarhus is quite safe, though occasionally plagued with young immigrants (primarily of Middle Eastern descent) who harass people, sell drugs, and engage in vandalism. These incidents might be rarer these days, but if you are a group of young males with a Middle Eastern look, be aware that you could risk being denied access to some of the more popular spots. Drinking does not limit itself to the night (or the weekends) in Danish culture, so you will not have a problem finding a good place for a cold beer, a nice drink or a glass of wine in the afternoon or even in the morning.\n\nThe most widely available Danish beers are Tuborg, Carlsberg and Ceres. With a 150-year history in Aarhus, Ceres was by many considered the \"beer of Aarhus\", with Ceres TOP as the flagship pilsner, but the beer is not brewed locally anymore. Most places also serve other well-known international brands, mostly on draft. Quite a few spots specialize in quality beers and craft brews, and offer a large variety for the beer connoisseur. This trend seems to have spilled over and affected many of the regular places as well.\n\nCocktail bars are getting increasingly popular, with most places now offering some kind of mixed drink as an alternative to the omnipresent beer. Quality whiskey, rum and gin can be had in many bars. While in Danish culture wine is traditionally enjoyed with food rather than by itself, there are a few high-end wine bars that are very popular.\n\nMany Aarhus bars change concept and/or owners quite often, some every 2-3 years or so, while other spots close and new ones emerge. The listing below is therefore incomplete and may be out of date, though we've tried to limit it to places with proven staying power.\n\n=== Frederiksbjerg ===\nA neighbourhood with its own atmosphere, separated from the rest of the city centre by the central rail yard. Frederiksbjerg's nightlife scene is a mix of traditional #Bodegaer and værtshuse|''bodegaer'' and ''værtshuse'' of the type you can read about below, as well as some newer and more fashionable spots.\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n=== Frederiksgade ===\nThis partly pedestrianized street brims with nightlife.\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n=== Riverside ===\nMost of the cafés near the mouth of the river turn into bars and nightclubs in the late evening, but there are also many places here dedicated exclusively to nightlife. One of the busiest bar scenes in the city, the riverside can be hectic Friday and Saturday nights, attracting many young people. The rest of the week, the promenades along the river offers a more laid-back vibe. Despite the many upscale and fashionable places, there are a surprisingly ample selection of budget-friendly options in between. The nightlife scene here starts off at '''Immervad''', the small bridge crossing the canal at Frederiksgade, and stretches all the way to the mouth of the river at the harbourfront.\n\n* \n* \n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n=== Skolegade ===\nSkolegade is an old narrow sidestreet behind Åboulevarden with a long history as a nightlife destination. Most of the action is near the south end, closest to the riverside.\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n=== Latin Quarter ===\n\nAs at the riverside, several of the Latin Quarter's cafés turn into festive bars in the evening, while other places serve as such all day.\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n=== Elsewhere ===\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n=== ''Bodegaer'' and ''værtshuse'' ===\nIn Denmark, a ''bodega'' is a traditional Danish pub or bar. The ''bodega'' has a long cultural history in Denmark and is conceptually somewhat similar to an English pub, but only a few places offer meals and live music. You could warm up at one before going to a concert or a fancy club, or you can drop in for a coffee or a beer in the afternoon. It should be fairly easy to find yourself engaged in a conversation at these places, as the majority of people are here to socialize and unwind.\n* \n\nIn the older days, when alcohol was seen as a basic thirst-quencher for the working man, bars were much more abundant. These were watering holes with the sole purpose of serving cheap beers all day, every day. The Danish word for these basic bars is ''værtshus'', which loosely translates as \"hosting-house\": in other words, a place that hosts people for drinking. Times have changed, but there are still some of these places left in Aarhus, many with their own peculiar charm. They are mostly frequented by regulars, but visiting strangers are welcomed too. The crowd at these places can be a lovely mix of joyful people at times, especially weekend nights.\n\n\nCeres TOP pilsner is the ''de rigueur'' beer in ''bodegaer'' and ''værtshuse'', but other alcoholic beverages are usually available too, along with coffee and soft drinks. An \"Aarhus set\" consists of a Ceres TOP with a shot of Arnbitter on the side, both beverages from Aarhus. Shots of black liquorice-flavoured vodka, often referred to as ''Fisk'', are popular with young people.\n\nIn popular usage, the terminology can be confusing: the words ''værtshus'', ''bodega'', and ''café'' are nowadays often employed indiscriminately in business names, and in particular ''værtshus'' can be used for any kind of bar. To learn more about the true original ''værtshus'' concept — and to learn how to differentiate between the three categories yourself — you can start your field research at these spots:\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Sleep==\nPrices for hotels are generally higher than in other parts of Europe, but there are a number budget options of a good quality.\n\nApart from the well known hotels listed below, there are also options for small [http://www.bedandbreakfastguide.dk/gb/home.htm bed and breakfasts] — usually located some distance outside the city centre — as well as private stays and holiday rentals.\n\n===Budget===\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Mid-range===\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Splurge===\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n=== ''Kroer'' ===\n''Kroer'' (singular ''kro'') are traditional country inns of a type that has a long history in Denmark: a nationwide network of these places was laid out by royal decree beginning in the 13th century (and culminating in the 17th) in order to provide easy shelter, dining and fresh horses for the king and his entourage when travelling through the country. Others emerged in places like village halls and old flour mills to provide food and accommodation for larger gatherings and celebrations in the surrounding rural communities. Today, ''kroer'' are usually held in high social regard. If you're looking for an all-inclusive getaway in a romantic countryside setting, yet not too far away from the action of the central city, this might be the option you're looking for.\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n== Connect ==\n\n=== Wi-Fi ===\nNearly all hotels supply free Wi-Fi and limited workspaces. Most cafés also offers free Wi-Fi for customers, but gazing into your laptop for more than half-an-hour in a café is usually disapproved and you are best advised to find another spot to satisfy your digital needs. In this case Aarhus's free municipal WiFi network, [https://www.aakb.dk/smartaarhus-aarhus-wifi Smart Aarhus], can be freely accessed in and around most public squares, parks, and institutions, including the Urban Mediaspace of Dokk1 where finding a spot to sit around should not be a problem.\n\n=== Computers ===\nIf you need to use a computer, the library at '''Dokk1''' has several terminals for public use, with Internet access through an SMS authentication system and printing services available for a fee. Also free Wi-Fi throughout the building.\n\n== Cope ==\n\n=== Accessibility ===\nIn Denmark, all newer buildings — and quite a few older ones as well — are specially equipped with ramps, elevators, lifts, and sometimes escalators to help handicapped people navigate the public space. As well, the beeping sound you hear coming from the traffic lights at some of Aarhus' busier intersections are there to help visually impaired pedestrians know when it's safe to cross. Guide dogs are allowed in most places (even in some cinemas), and personnel are unusually friendly and helpful towards the handicapped.\n\n=== Begging ===\n\nThe homeless in Aarhus are usually harmless (to the point where you could make small talk with many of them), and aggressive begging is uncommon. Many of them earn a nominal income selling the street newspaper ''Hus Forbi'' (\"House Passed\") to passersby in public places.\n\n=== Consulates ===\n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n\n== Stay healthy ==\nIn case of medical emergency, tourists should call the general medical emergency line at +45 70 11 31 31 or, in the case of life-threatening emergencies, 112. There is only one '''[https://www.en.auh.dk/departments/emergency-department/ emergency centre]''' serving all of Aarhus. It is located at the new Aarhus University Hospital out of town in the northern district of Skejby. Take note, that you are required to call in advance in any circumstance!\n\nThere are many pharmacies ''(Apotek)'' in Aarhus, in the city centre as well as the outlying districts. Supermarkets and some shops also sell non-prescription medicine. At the  near the Cathedral, medicine can be picked up all week 06:00-24:00.\n\n'''COVID-19 tests for foreign tourists''': If you are a \"close contact\" or have symptoms of Covid-19, you should have a PCR test. PCR tests are free of charge in Denmark. Non-Danish citizens have to register at Covidresults.dk before showing up at a test centre.

The region offers many kinds of activities and experiences, especially in the summertime.\n\n\n* A trip through the immediate countryside around Aarhus — say, to the '''Jeksendalen''' valley southwest of town, or around '''Norsminde Fjord''' on the coast — combined with a nice meal at a roadside ''kro'' can make for a great little getaway from the city. This is best done on four wheels rather than two: many roads here are narrow, there are no bike lanes, and car traffic can be fast-moving.\n* '''Djursland''' is the \"nose\" of Jutland immediately northeast of Aarhus, a thinly-populated rural area where folks have made a living farming and fishing for millenia — a history you can get a sense of in the preserved Medieval-era old town of '''Ebeltoft''', or at the ruins of '''Kalø Castle''', both part of '''[http://eng.nationalparkmolsbjerge.dk/ Mols Bjerge National Park]''' which comprises most of southern Djursland.

Hiking is a major attraction of this region: the '''[https://www.visitaarhus.com/aarhus-region/plan-your-trip/hiking-route-aarhus-silkeborg-gdk1093269 Aarhus-Silkeborg hiking trail]''' leads from the city centre through a scenic landscape of rivers and lakes to the town of Silkeborg, where you'll find an impressive modern art museum and yet another aquarium — '''Ferskvandscentret''' — displaying native freshwater aquatic species. From Silkeborg you can press on to '''Himmelbjerget''', or the Sky Mountain, one of the highest points in Denmark with an impressive view of the surrounding landscape from the red brick tower on top. Elsewhere in the region is Skanderborg, a small historic town that was once the royal family's favorite hunting grounds and later during the Second World War served as headquarters of the Danish faction of the Luftwaffe (you can explore this history at the '''Skanderborg Museum'''), and Horsens, a port town that's home of the European Medieval Festival.\n* '''Samsø''' is clearly visible from Aarhus across the bay, and is accessible by car ferry from the village of Hou. A new small catamaran ferry (no vehicles except bicycles), M/F Lilleør, also connects the center of Aarhus with Samsø. The pace slows on this pastoral island powered entirely by renewable energy, with golf, horseback riding, and fine dining all on offer.\n* '''Vejle''', Southern Jutland's regional capital, boasts a range of historic and art museums as well as '''Trekantsområdets Festuge''', a 10-day regional cultural festival akin to Aarhus Festuge.\n*'''Viborg''' is - like Aarhus - an old Cathedral town with an interesting townscape full of history, quirky alleyways and summertime street life. It is a work-hard, play-hard town, home of one of Denmark's most popular and dominant football teams. Viborg has been administrative capital of the entire ''Region Midtjylland'' (Central Denmark Region) since 2007.\n\n===Further afield===\n\n*Denmark's third-largest city, '''Odense''', is the birthplace of fairy-tale fabulist Hans Christian Andersen, and it plays that connection to the hilt for the benefit of tourists: the house he grew up in is now a museum, Little Mermaid statues dot the town liberally, and there are parades and monuments in his honor.\n*A lively student culture rules the day in '''Aalborg''', in the far north of Denmark, home of the eponymous '''University of Aalborg''' as well as '''Jomfru Ane Gade''', the longest bar street in Scandinavia.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It is a port city and oil refining center. During the 1980 Iran-Iraq war, the city was emptied of people and heavily damaged.\n\n==Understand==\nAbadan is the capital of Abadan County. It is on Abadan Island (68 km or 42 mi long, 3–19 km or 2–12 miles wide). The island is bounded in the west by the Arvand waterway and to the east by the Bahmanshir outlet of the Karun River (the Arvand Rood), 53 km (33 mi) from the Persian Gulf, near the Iran–Iraq border. Abadan is 140 km from the provincial capital city of Ahvaz.\n\nIn September 1980, Abadan was almost overrun during a surprise attack on Khuzestan by Iraq, marking the beginning of the Iran–Iraq War. For 12 months, Abadan was besieged, but never captured, by Iraqi forces, and in September 1981, the Iranians broke the siege of Abadan. Much of the city, including the oil refinery, which was the world's largest refinery with capacity of 628,000 barrels per day, was badly damaged or destroyed by the siege and by bombing. Prior to the war, the city's civilian population was about 300,000, but at the war's end nearly the entire populace had sought refuge elsewhere in Iran.\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate in Abadan is arid and similar to Baghdad's, but slightly hotter due to Abadan's lower latitude. Summers are dry and extremely hot, with temperatures above 45 °C (113 °F) almost daily and temperatures above 50 °C (122 °F) can be almost common.

It's also home to the two most famous resorts in Kiribati, Ouba Islet Resort and Teirio Beach Resort.   \n\n==Understand==\nA good glimpse of one of it very beautiful and white sandy beaches can also be seen when looking at the island’s direction from the north end tip of South Tarawa. It is in Abaiang that you can see historical landmarks made by the white colonizers of the island, a Negro cannibal who landed on Abaiang in the early days and founders of Protestant Church in Kiribati. Abaiang is also known to all as a house of the first church in Kiribati and also has a distinction of being one of the cradles of Christianity and schools both of Protestants and Catholics in the Kiribati group. Other visible attractions include shrines, well of high chief of Abaiang in the early days and sites of pioneers of the island. With a wide range of historical and cultural cultural attractions seen, the only home for two famous resorts in Kiribati and its closeness to the capital, Abaiang is considered one the marvellous and convenient laid-back hideaways in Kiribati.\n\n===Geography===\nAbaiang Island has a total land area of 16 square kilometres and an estimated distance of about 23 miles from North to South. The main government centre is located at Taburao village. The island also serves as a home for two secondary schools, each of them owned either by Roman Catholic Church or Kiribati Protestant Church. The island has a population of 5,568 (2015 census).\n\n===History===\nThe history of Abaiang Island started with the belief that ancestors living on it were known to be spirits, some of them created in Samoa and some in Abaiang. Years passed by and then real people came along followed then by the arrival of Reverend Dr. Bingham and his team, international traders, beachcombers, whalers and even labour traders. Colonizers then came along too and hoisted Union Jack on the island.\n\nThe first church in Kiribati also established on Abaiang Island in 1859 by Reverend Dr Hiram Bingham and his team. Reverend Dr. Bingham, his wife and his team were sent from America in 1856 to set up a mission in Kiribati. Their arrival in Abaiang was coincided with a war between Ten Temaua and Ten Teiwaki. Reverend Bingham and his team stayed with Ten Temaua. Ten Teiwaki took immediate fancy for Mrs. Bingham and announced that he will take her as his wife only if he won the war but unfortunately, he lost it. Their arrival on Abaiang also marked the important era in the establishment of the first Protestant Church in Kiribati. \n\nIn a traditional context of Abaiang Island, it was a paramount chief who ruled and provided overall leadership of the island in the past. Following independence of Kiribati, the overall leadership of Abaiang changed whereby the Mayor (formerly Chief Councilor) and the elderly men are now playing the role of providing political leadership for the island.

Once unimaginably far in the back of beyond, the name Abashiri used to strike terror into the hearts of suspected lawbreakers: it was the site of Japan's first maximum-security prison, built in 1890 when the enlightened Meiji era leaders decided to copy Western ways instead of simply executing convicted criminals.  Enlightenment in this case, however, translated into backbreaking hard labor (mostly road construction) and, for difficult cases like political prisoners, unheated cells in a region where winter temperatures often fall below -20 ° (-4 °F).  The prison was finally closed in 1984, though a newly constructed prison continues the tradition.\n\nToday's Abashiri is an unattractive modern town filled with the implements and smells of its largest industry, fishing.\n\n===Tourist information site===\nThe local tourist association has a [https://visit-abashiri.jp/ Japanese-only guide site].\n\n==Get in==\nAbashiri is the closest thing in northern Hokkaido to a transport hub.\n\n===By plane===\nThe nearest airport is Memanbetsu, 16 km south of Abashiri.

With mountains visible in nearly every direction, it is in one of the most geographically stunning regions of British Columbia. Abbotsford is an agriculture-based city that is a popular visitor stop over point for U.S. travellers north bound to the Yukon and Alaska and Canadians travelling east and west along the Trans-Canada Highway.\n\n==Understand==\n\n===History===\nAbbotsford's colonial development began when the Royal Engineers surveyed the area in response to the gold rush along the Fraser River in 1858. This led to the building of Yale Road (today Old Yale Road), the first transportation route to link the Fraser Valley. The settlement grew and the production of butter, milk and tobacco began by the late 1860s. In 1889, former Royal Engineer John Cunningham Maclure applied for a Crown grant to obtain the 160 acres (0.65 km²) that would become Abbotsford.\n\nThere is some controversy over the origin of the Abbotsford name. The most commonly cited origin is that Maclure named the land \"Abbotsford\" after family friend Henry Braithwaite Abbott, the western superintendent of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Until 1922 the name was spelled Abottsford. Maclure's sons later stated that the property had been named for Sir Walter Scott's home, Abbotsford, and pronounced it with the accent on ford, while in his later years Maclure claimed that the naming had been \"a combination of two ideas\".\n\n\nThe title passed hands to Robert Ward, who filed a townsite subdivision on July 9, 1891. Also in 1891, the CPR built a railway line through the area that connected Mission with the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway at Sumas, Washington. This route was the only rail connection between Vancouver and Seattle until 1904. In 1892, Robert Ward sold many of the lots to private investors, and sold a significant portion to the Great Northern Railway’s subsidiary company the Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway. The British Columbia Electric Railway (BCER) arrived in 1910. The Interurban, as the BCER tram linking Abbotsford with Vancouver and Chilliwack was called, was discontinued in 1950.\n\n==Get in==\n===By plane===\n\n==== Airport ====\n*  | url=https://www.abbotsfordairport.ca/ | email=\n| address=30440 Liberator Ave | lat=49.0225 | long=-122.3804 | directions=\n| phone=+1 604-855-1001 | tollfree=\n| hours= | price=\n| wikipedia=Abbotsford International Airport | image=CYXX.JPG | wikidata=Q969671\n| lastedit=2022-05-26\n| content=Abbotsford is served by the second largest airport in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia.

Instead, save several hours and $50-100 by taking a local bus from Bellingham, WA to the Sumas-Hungtingdon border crossing, crossing on foot, then taking an Abbostford local bus into town. Bus 71x leaves Bellingham's Cordata Station for Sumas four times a day Monday through Friday, twice a day on Saturday (make sure to check the schedules online or with Google Maps before you go).

It was named for the founder, Major James Abbott (later General Sir James Abbott).\n\nAt one time, the city was quite important as a transport hub, a stop on the main route north toward Gilgit and China. Its importance in this role has been somewhat diminished by the completion of the Karakoram Highway.\n\n==Get in==\n\nFrom Rawalpindi or Islamabad you can reach Abbottabad by road in less than 3 hours.

                "revision": {
                    "text": "\n\n'''Abel Tasman National Park''' is in the Nelson Bays region of the South Island of New Zealand, between Golden Bay and Tasman Bay.\n\n==Understand==\n\n\nLocated in the Tasman District on the northern tip of the South Island. The park is closed to vehicles, and access is either on foot (from one of the various carparks mentioned below) or by boat, or if you've got money to spend it is possible to charter a helicopter or small plane (Awaroa only).\n\nSome of the land in the park is privately owned - mainly in Awaroa Bay and Torrent Bay. It is important to remember this when visiting the park - the locals are friendly but they don't want loads of travellers walking through their backyards all the time! However these areas are clearly marked so you shouldn't have any problems.\n\n===History===\nAbel Tasman, a Dutch explorer, was the first European to visit New Zealand, and he anchored in Golden Bay on 18 December 1642. He encountered the native Maori people there, who attacked the foreign intruders. Tasman sailed on up the west coast of the North Island, avoiding further contact with native New Zealanders.\n\nAround 1855, more Europeans began to arrive and permanent settlements began to spring up.  These settlements began to pillage the land's resources - logging for homes and ships, mining of granite, and creation of pasture through burning.\n\nThe park, created out of protest due to concerns about heavy logging in the area, was officially opened on 18 December 1942, exactly 300 years after Abel Tasman's visit.  The initial grant was 15,000 hectares of government land and the park has since grown to over 22,000 hectares, though it is still New Zealand's smallest national park.\n\n===Landscape===\n\n\nThe most notable feature of the park are its beaches.  The golden sands bring many visitors, some for just a day, others for overnight trips.  However, moving away from the beaches and inland, the park is mountainous and rough.\n\nSome areas of the park are very tidal. Watch out in particular for the estuaries at Torrent Bay and Awaroa - these can drain almost completely at low tide! So be aware of this before anchoring your boat in some places. In fact, at low tide it is possible to walk from Torrent Bay to Anchorage by walking across the empty estuary - this takes about 25 minutes, whereas the track around the outside of the estuary takes closer to 2 hours. Some beaches also have unusual sand bars - if in doubt, don't go too close to shore in your boat, or you might run aground unexpectedly!\n\n===Flora and fauna===\n\n\nMuch of the nature vegetation was destroyed by the area's early inhabitants, but the park is now slowly renewing itself.  All four species of New Zealand beech trees (''Nothofagus'') grow in the park, an unusual find.\n\nWildlife consists mostly of avian life, but rare birds such as the kiwi are not present.  Other wildlife, such as the blue penguin, can be found in the more isolated areas of the park now that their population have begun to dwindle. You can still see (and hear!) lots of birds - keep an eye out for wood pigeons, tuis (you will definitely hear these even if you don't see them), bellbirds, wekas (rare flightless birds), pukekos, oystercatchers (by the sea) and cormorants.\n\nMuch of New Zealand's native wildlife is under attack by introduced species and the Department of Conservation (DOC) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) are trying desperately to halt these attacks.  Stoats, a relative of the ferret, were introduced into New Zealand to control rabbits in the 1880s.  However, those stoats, then and today, prefer the native animal populations such as the blue penguins over rabbits or their other \"normal\" prey.\n\nWhen exploring Abel Tasman or any other national park, you may see traps for introduced species such as the stoat or the possum.  Please do not disturb these efforts to maintain New Zealand's natural wildlife.\n\n===Climate===\nThe Abel Tasman National Park is in one of the sunniest places in the country with over 2000 hours of sunlight per year.  There is moderate rainfall that is spread out over the year and occasionally snow at higher elevations.\n\n*'''Average temperatures'''\n** '''Summer''', December–February.  High: 72F, 22C. Low: 55F, 13C.\n** '''Fall''', March–May.  High: 64F, 18C. Low: 46F, 8C.\n** '''Winter''', June–August.  High: 55F, 13C. Low: 37F, 3C.\n** '''Spring''', September–November.  High: 63F, 17C.  Low: 45F, 7C.\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By car===\nThere are four carpark entrances to the park. From here, you walk into the park.\n* '''Marahau'''.  The southern entrance, 67&amp;nbsp;km on a sealed road from Nelson (New Zealand)|Nelson.\n* '''Wainui'''.  21&amp;nbsp;km from Takaka.  The road is sealed for all but the final 2&amp;nbsp;km.\n* '''Totaranui'''.  32&amp;nbsp;km from Takaka.  The road is sealed for all but the final 13&amp;nbsp;km.\n* '''Awaroa'''.  31&amp;nbsp;km from Takaka.  The road is sealed for all but the rough, final 12&amp;nbsp;km.  This road has two fords which are susceptible to flooding.\n\n===By boat===\nMost companies depart from Marahau or Kaiteriteri going to the main beaches of the park. Some arrange tours also in the park, see below.\n\n==Fees and permits==\nThere are no fees to enter the park.\n\n==Get around==\n\n* \n* \n\n==See==\n* '''Seals'''.  Fur seals can be seen in a number of places in the park and there is a large colony at Tonga Island.  Do not get closer than 20 metres of the seals.\n* '''Tonga Island Marine Reserve'''.\n** '''Approach on foot'''.  Start from Awaroa Hut toward Venture Creek and then over Tonga Saddle to Onetahuti Beach.  If coming from the carpark at Tonga Quarry, a low tide crossing is required.\n** '''Approach by sea'''.  The nearest boat ramp is at Totaranui and caution should be used due to unmarked reefs as well as strong winds.\n** '''By bus or hired boat'''.  Consult the visitor centres in Motueka, Takaka, or Nelson.\n* '''Cleopatra's Pool'''. This is a beautiful rock pool with a natural, moss-lined waterslide! It is about 1 hour's walk from Torrent Bay and from Anchorage. If you follow the high tide track between these two places, you will eventually reach the turn-off to Cleopatra's. A couple of things to be aware of - firstly, the track to the pool crosses the river (there's no bridge, you have to hop across a few rocks), so if it has been raining over the last couple of days, it can be quite dangerous to cross. Secondly, the bottom of the 'waterslide' sometimes has a few hidden rocks - check it and clear away any big rocks before using the slide.\n* '''Falls River bridge'''. An impressive footbridge which crosses the Falls River. It is on the track between Bark Bay and Torrent Bay.\n* '''Cascade Falls'''. A beautiful waterfall hidden in among stunning bush. The river, while cold, is also a good spot to cool off. Cascade Falls is located about 1½ hours walk from Torrent Bay. This is one of the more difficult tracks as it is quite steep in parts, but it is definitely worth the hike! Set out from Torrent Bay on the High Tide track to Anchorage and follow the signs - the turnoff to Cascade Falls is approximately 15 minutes from the Torrent Bay campsite.\n\n==Do==\n\n\n\n* '''[http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/tracks-and-walks/nelson-tasman/golden-bay/abel-tasman-coast-track/ Abel Tasman Coast Track]'''.

This is allowed in 2 sections of the park, by permit only, most of the year, but not from the 3rd Mon in Dec until 6 Feb (Waitangi Day). Check local papers for specific dates. An additional permit is required to bring a hunting dog. The game is red deer, feral pigs and feral goats.\n* '''Mountain biking'''. This is permitted at two places. A section of the Moa Park Track can be used year-round. The Gibbs Hill Track can be used between 1 May and 1 Oct.\n* '''Swim'''. The beaches are safe – the surf is minimal and there is little risk of riptides. The water is warm in summer. Some of the more tidal beaches are shallow just before and after high tide, so are great for young children.\n* \n* '''No horse riding'''. This is not allowed in the park.\n\n==Buy==\n* There is nothing to buy anywhere inside the park.\n\n==Eat==\n* All food must be carried into the park.  There are no shops at which to purchase food or supplies. However, there is a cafe at Awaroa Lodge in Awaroa Bay. You don't have to be a guest at the lodge in order to eat here. It is definitely not cheap, compared with similar style cafes outside of the Park.\n\nPlease help to maintain the park's natural beauty - take all your rubbish out with you!\n\n==Drink==\n\n==Sleep==\n\n\n===Lodges===\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Huts===\n* '''Department of Conservation huts'''.

Be sure to carry out all trash and pick up after others.\n\n==Stay safe==\n* '''Safety is your responsibility''' - always let someone know before you head into the backcountry.  Leave your intentions with a local DoC office.\n* '''Be prepared.''' Check the weather and consider your equipment.  On the coast track be sure to consider the tide schedule before starting - there are two crossing that must be made during low tide.\n** '''Insect repellent'''.

The island is well known for its pristine beach and crystal clear blue lagoon. In Abemama, you still can find physical evidence of American and Japanese WWII relics, cultural shrines and sites/monuments relating to their traditional spirits and famous King Binoka. The island is considered one of the popular weekend hideaways for expatriate from Tarawa, the capital. It is usually visited by cruising yachts due to its very sheltered lagoon bay. It also has the potential to host fly fishermen due its abundance of bonefishes.\n\n==Get in==\n\n\n\n'''Bonriki International Airport''' on South Tarawa is the only international airport for Kiribati. '''Air Kiribati''' and '''Coral Sun Airways''' serve passengers between islands, usually with weekly flights.\n\n==Understand==\nAbemama has 3 main islets. The main islet has 11 villages. Abatiku and Biike are on the southwestern side of the atoll.\n\n===Geography===\n\nAbemama has an area of 16 square kilometers and an estimated population 3,299 (census 2016). The islets surround a deep lagoon. \n\nThe eastern part of the atoll of Abemama is linked by causeways making automobile traffic possible between the different islets. The outlying islands of Abatiku and Bike are situated on the southwestern side of the atoll. The village of Kariatebike serves as the government center for the atoll which includes an administration building, the police station and a hospital. Next to Kariatebike on the eastern side is Chevalier College and the western side is the only government Junior Secondary School.\n\n===History, tradition and culture===\n\nAbemama is known as the island where the Declaration of a British Protectorate made by Captain Davis of Royalist on 27 May 1892. The first British Resident Commissioner was CR Swayne who was appointed in 1893. To rule such a scattered empire, which included Ellice Islands at a time of very poor shipping was a near impossibility. The Resident Commissioner therefore started to appoint Island officials. In Abemama, officials were automatically chosen from the chiefly family.\n\nIn 1889, it was also the home of Robert Louis Stevenson. Near Tabontebike is the tomb of a tyrant-chief Tem Binoka, who was immortalized by Stevenson in his novel “In the South Seas”. During WWII the American submarine USS Nautilus landed a force of 78 Marine Amphibious Reconnaissance Scouts to seize the island on 21 November 1943. On the morning of 25 November, a native reported to the Marines that the remaining Japanese committed suicide.\n\nIn most of the northern islands, there are several district leaders, each of whom led a group of Kainga. On Abemama – Kuria – Aranuka one chief was recognized as paramount. The chiefly dynasty of Abemama, Kuria and Aranuka was only consolidated after the arrival of Europeans. The heads of the Kainga were always consulted on matters affecting the community and could initiate action, but always they were obliged to seek the approval of the chief, who provided overall leadership and regulated relationships amongst the kainga. Strong evidence of these early activities can still be physically seen on the ground and stories related to them transcend from one generation to another. In Abemama, the chiefly family and its present generation are still highly regarded and respected status among the community is still intact and recognized.\n\n===Traditional welcome for first-time visitors===\n\na) Any tour of the island for first time visitors should start from Kabangaki village\n\nb)Traditional shrines and cultural sites are recommended sites to visit/see and all visitors are advised to bring sticks of tobacco (3) as offering gifts at the shrines.\n\nc) All visitors are advised to drive slowly when passing through a village or a maneaba where a meeting of the community elders is held.\n\nd) Visitors especially women are advised to appropriately cover their body when walking around the villages (bikinis are not acceptable).\n\ne) The sitting protocol for every maneaba or homes of the local people is that you have to sit and fold your legs probably and it’s considered insulting to stretch out your legs while sitting.\n\n==See==\n\n==Do==\nThis gorgeous location provides more activities besides lounging on the beach -which you will absolutely want to do.\n\n*Learn te Kamei dancing.

Medical facilities are limited on the islands to a local clinic and village nurse. Pharmaceuticals are not available and you will to ensure you have any medications you may require and basic medical supplies. Please also ensure you have advised family and friends of your travel plans and when you expect to return.\n\n==Respect==\nIt is also important to note that as a sign of respect you will need to leave offerings at a number of the shrines you visit. Tobacco/cigarettes are the traditional offering. If you are interested in participating in any cultural activity, have it arranged prior your travel or you can ask around the local people and they are usually most obliging.\n\n==Connect==\nCommunications while on the island may be limited; however some villages will have a public phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

                    "text": "\n'''Aberdeen''' (Scottish Gaelic phrasebook|Scottish Gaelic: ''Obar Dheathain'', Scots: ''Aiberdeen'') is the third-largest city in Scotland, United Kingdom, with a population of almost 200,000 (2018). It is a harbour city on Scotland's north-east coast, approximately 120&amp;nbsp;miles (190&amp;nbsp;km) north of Edinburgh and 400&amp;nbsp;miles (650&amp;nbsp;km) north of London, where the Rivers Dee and Don meet the North Sea. It is an important sea port, regional centre, and the hub of the North Sea oil industry.\n\nAlthough remote by UK standards, this is no backwater; Aberdeen is a prosperous and cosmopolitan city (partly due to North Sea oil) and is characterised by its grand and ornate architecture. Most buildings are constructed out of granite quarried in and around the city, and as a result, Aberdeen is often referred to as '''The Granite City'''. It is also known for its many outstanding parks, gardens and floral displays throughout the city, and for its long, sandy beach. Aberdeen boasts the title of '''Oil Capital of Europe''' and has been voted in several polls as the happiest place in Britain, with a 2006 poll citing access to large areas of greenery and community spirit. It has won the Britain in Bloom competition 10 times.\n\nAberdeen does not attract as many tourists as other Scottish destinations such as Edinburgh or St Andrews, and can feel more authentic. It is a great place to stop for a couple of days on a tour of Scotland, and especially good as a base for exploring the wider region to take advantage of the castles, golf, whisky distilleries, scenery, mountains (including skiing and snowboarding), coast and other attractions in Aberdeenshire and Royal Deeside. Alternatively, Aberdeen's remoteness yet comforts and cosmopolitan nature makes it an interesting destination for a short city break if you really want to get away from the stress.\n\n== Understand ==\n\nAberdeen is set in fertile lowlands and is the natural regional centre, becoming a city in 1179 when two villages grew into each other. Old Aberdeen is north, by the mouth of the River Don, and home to the University since 1495. New Aberdeen developed from 1136 two miles south near the mouth of the River Dee: this has a much better harbour and became the city centre. It was bashed about in conflicts until 1745, but then followed a long spell of peace and prosperity. Aberdeen was rebuilt in its signature grey granite along the broad axis of Union Street east-west, which intersects the historic coast road then at Castlegate turns north along King Street. So grand and confident were these buildings, they bankrupted the city in 1817, probably a civic first. Aberdeen recovered through its traditional industries based on farming, fishing, knitware and paper, but by the late 20th century these were in decline. The city was out on a limb, a long way from markets, materials and labour... and then they struck oil.\n\nIn the 1960s the North Sea was shown to have commercially exciting reserves of gas to the south and oil to the north, and the quirks of international frontiers awarded Britain the lion's share. This transformed UK politics and the economy, nowhere more so than in Aberdeen. The oilfields lay many miles offshore, but in a relatively shallow sea, and technology advanced to exploit them. Oil was brought ashore at Sullom Voe in Shetland and at Grangemouth on the Firth of Forth. It never came through Aberdeen: the city's role was as a support base for the oil platforms, and centre of industrial innovation as the quest for new fields moved into deeper darker waters. The skies were busy with the chatter of helicopters ferrying workers to and from the rigs. The city was a boom town and property prices soared.\n\n\"It's Scotland's Oil!\" became a rallying cry, OPEC quotas drove up the oil price and until 2014 it looked as if oil could fuel the vehicle of Scottish independence. But a referendum voted against it, and the price later collapsed. The price, and Aberdeen's fortunes, have been up and down since, illustrating the risks around a single cash crop. Moreover, sentiment turned against oil as a carbon-based fuel from a dwindling non-renewable source. The industry remains a big player here, but the city needs to diversify. \n\nAberdeen is a year-round destination, provided you've got enough weather-proof clothing. Its winters are mild compared to other cities at about 56-57 North such as Riga, Gothenburg, Juneau or Novosibirsk, but by British standards it's cool. It's sheltered from the prevailing southwesterly airstream, so it has many sunny days when the granite buildings sparkle; the parks and gardens are glorious in early summer. Mid-summer days are 18 hours long and the nights no more than twilight. In still conditions a fog bank or ''haar'' forms over the cold North Sea, and the evening breeze brings it onshore to cloak the city, until the daytime offshore breeze pushes it out again. Northeasterly winds bring the worst of the ''dreich'', a word worth practising before you arrive, and the midwinter sun often fails to get out of bed for its allotted shift of 8:30AM-3:30PM. Between the louring low grey clouds, drizzle and churning grey sea, you can pretty much lose the entire grey city.\n\nEven then, you'll still know where you are because of the unique dialect known as \"Doric\". This is even more marked in the countryside, so see Aberdeenshire#Talk for the gen on Doric, which to date defies machine translation. \n\n=== Vistor information ===\n* [https://www.visitscotland.com/places-to-go/aberdeen-city-shire Visit Scotland guide to Aberdeen &amp; Aberdeenshire]\n* \n\n== Read ==\n* '''Sunset Song''' is the classic novel of this region in the last days of horse-drawn farming, and the onslaught of the First World War. Written by Lewis Grassic Gibbon (James Leslie Mitchell 1901-35) and published in 1932, it's been voted Scotland's favourite novel. It may also be the most \"given up on\" novel, problems being the artificial diction used to render Mearns country speech, and the \"Cold Comfort Farm\" heaping up of misfortunes; but it's worth persevering or a second go.\n* '''Cloud Howe''' (1933) is the second of Gibbon's \"Scots Quair\" trilogy and '''Grey Granite''' (1934) the third, as the heroine rebuilds her life and moves to the city. They're not as well regarded but all have been adapted for TV. And then young Gibbon upped and died, with so much creative output yet before him.\n* '''Logan McRae''' is the fictional Detective Sergeant who probes the city streets in the thrillers by Stuart MacBride (b 1969). These include ''Cold Granite'' (2005), ''Dying Light'' (2006), ''Blind Eye'' (2009), ''Shatter the Bones'' (2011), ''Close to the Bone'' (2013) and ''The Missing and the Dead'' (2015). \n* '''Stonemouth''' (2012, televised 2015) is a novel by Iain Banks (1954-2013), following a man returning to a small seaport (loosely based on Stonehaven) having fled after a sex scandal. \n* '''Silver: An Aberdeen Anthology''' (2009) is a collection of poems old and new, edited by Alan Spence and Hazel Hutchison. \n* '''Architecture:''' look for ''Aberdeen: The Illustrated Architectural Guide'' by W.

Central Library on Rosemount Viaduct has a local section just inside the doorway.\n\n== Get in ==\n\n=== By plane ===\nThere are direct international flights to Aberdeen from Amsterdam, Bergen, Burgas, Copenhagen, Dublin, Esbjerg, Gdansk, Geneva, Groningen, Haugesund, Paris CDG, Riga, Oslo, and Stavanger, plus seasonal flights to the Mediterranean.\n\nThere's a good range of UK flights, as Aberdeen is far to reach by rail. These include London Heathrow (with BA), London Gatwick and Luton (with easyJet), Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Durham, Humberside, Kirkwall on Orkney, Leeds, Manchester, Norwich, Newcastle, Southampton, Stornoway on Lewis, Sumburgh on Shetland, and Wick. \n\nAberdeen is also a hub for transfers to the weird sounding destinations of Apache, Hurricane, Ineos, and Nexen. These are the names of oil and gas rigs out in the North Sea, served by helicopter from here.\n\n () is at Dyce, 7 miles (11 km) northwest from the city centre. There are car rental desks here but their stock is limited, best book in advance.\n\nBetween airport and city centre, take the bus. The '''[https://www.stagecoachbus.com Jet 727]''' is a big blue Stagecoach bus, running every 10-30 min to the main bus station in Union Square, next to the railway station. It runs daily between 4AM and midnight, taking 30 min. In early 2019, a single ticket costs £3.40 and a return (good for 28 days) costs £5. Bus 747 / 757 runs south from the airport direct to Stonehaven and Montrose, and north to Ellon with some buses continuing to Peterhead.\n\nDyce has a railway station, but it's wrong side of the runway from the terminal, a 45-min walk with no public transport. You could take a taxi there: you'd only do this to pick up a northbound train without going into city centre. The Aberdeen to Inverness trains stop at Dyce, Inverurie, Insch, Huntly, Keith, Forres and Nairn.\n\nA taxi to town will cost about £20.\n\n=== By train ===\n\n:''Wikivoyage has a guide to Rail travel in Great Britain.''\nAberdeen has trains hourly from Edinburgh and Glasgow Queen Street, both taking 2 hr 30 min, via Dundee. From England it's usually quicker to change in Edinburgh, but there are a few direct daytime trains from London King's Cross (via Peterborough, York and Newcastle) taking 7 hours. Likewise from the Midlands, with two or three trains winding all the way from Penzance via Exeter, Bristol, Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, York, Newcastle and Edinburgh. Trains also run from Inverness to Aberdeen every couple of hours, taking about 2 hours.\n\nThe Dundee-Aberdeen railway was closed for 12 weeks following a landslide and serious rail accident near Stonehaven on 12 Aug 2020, but it re-opened in November.\n\nThe '''[https://www.sleeper.scot/ Caledonian Highland Sleeper]''' runs Su-F from London Euston, departing around 9:30PM to arrive by 7:40AM. (Other portions run to Inverness and Fort William; they divide or join at Edinburgh.) The southbound train leaves around 9:30PM to reach Euston towards 8AM. No trains on Saturday night. New rolling stock was introduced on all the sleeper routes in 2019. Compartments have two berths and are sold like hotel rooms: you pay extra for single occupancy, and you won't be sharing with a stranger. Tickets can be booked at any UK mainline railway station or online: a single sleeper fare is around £200 for one or £250 for two people (as of June 2022). You can also just use the sitting saloon, single £75. If you have an existing ticket for a daytime train you need to buy a sleeper supplement. Pricing is dynamic: weekends cost more, if indeed there are berths available. Booking is open 12 months ahead: you need to print out your e-ticket to present on boarding.\n\n is in the city centre on Guild Street, one block from Union Street, very close to the bus station and ferry terminal. There's a Travel Centre (M-F 6:30AM-9:30PM, Sa 6:30AM-7PM, Su 9AM-21\n\n9:30PM), a left-luggage facility (M-Sa 7:30AM-9:30PM, Su 9AM-9PM), ticket machines, ATMs, a WH Smith store selling books, magazines and snacks, a café and toilets. Lots more convenience stores and quick eats in the adjoining Union Square retail complex.\n\n=== By bus ===\n\nBuses from London Victoria take about 13 hours; they pick up at intermediate points, for example, Manchester, but routes vary. [http://uk.megabus.com/ Megabus] has two direct buses per day and three with a change (two of them overnight). [http://www.nationalexpress.com National Express] has one daytime and one overnight direct bus, daily.\n\nBuses from Edinburgh take 3 hours, all via Dundee, but bypassing Perth. Megabus G92 runs four times M-Sa, thrice on Sunday. Scottish Citylink also have some half-a-dozen buses, so it's an hourly service.\n\nBuses from Glasgow likewise take 3 hours. Megabus G9 has six buses daily, mostly bypassing Perth and Dundee. Scottish Citylink run almost hourly and do serve Perth and Dundee.\n\nFrom Inverness take Stagecoach Bus 10. On Saturday only this runs hourly direct to Aberdeen, taking four hours. Other days it only runs to Inverurie, to connect with Bus 37 to Aberdeen. There are 3 connecting services M-F and one on Sunday.\n\nStagecoach buses fan out from Aberdeen all across the county, see \"Get in\" details for individual towns.\n is on Guild St, Union Square, next to the railway station. So you can use all the facilities there, e.g. the left-luggage office.\n\n===By car===\n\n\nFrom 30 May 2024, the city centre will be a '''[https://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/services/roads-transport-and-parking/low-emission-zone Low Emission Zone]'''. There will be a £60 penalty charge for driving into the city centre in a non-compliant car or van. Cars built after 2015 generally are compliant, but check [https://www.lowemissionzones.scot/ online]. The zone covers an area of a few blocks around Union Street.\n\nThe main road to Aberdeen from the south is A90, running from Edinburgh via the new Queen's Crossing (replacing the Forth Road Bridge), across Fife to bypass Perth and Dundee, inland to Forfar then Stonehaven, then turn onto A92 for the last stretch into Aberdeen. It's dual carriageway as far as Dundee, variable thereafter, with lower speed limits and many speed cameras on the Dundee section. Reckon 3 hours from Edinburgh and 3 hr 30 min from Glasgow.\n\nIn Feb 2019 the A90 was re-routed away from Aberdeen, with the opening of the \"Aberdeen Western Peripheral Road\" to relieve the congested A92. Expect glitches in road signage and Satnav directions for a few months yet.\n\nAnother route from the south is to take A93 north from Perth over Glenshee to Braemar, Balmoral and the Dee valley. It's scenic in summer but often difficult in winter, when the Glenshee section may be closed by snow.\n\nFrom the north-west, take A96 via the airport at Dyce. Reckon up to four hours from Inverness, as it's single-carriageway and serves commuter villages that are short on public transport, so traffic is heavy at rush hour.\n\n===By boat===\n\nAberdeen Harbour is right in the city centre, just about the first thing you see on leaving the bus station. The ferry terminal is off Market Street, next to the Union St car park entrance.\n\n'''[http://www.northlinkferries.co.uk/ NorthLink]''' car ferries sail overnight, year-round, to Lerwick in the Shetland Islands. Three or four nights a week they depart at 5PM and also call at Kirkwall in the Orkney Islands on the way; the other nights they depart at 7PM and sail non-stop to Lerwick. (They never call at tiny midway Fair Isle, which is reached via Shetland.) For practicalities of using these ferries, see Shetland Islands#Getin and Kirkwall#Getin.\n\nCruise ships often call at the harbour in summer. Check operators' websites to see if a point-to-point journey to Aberdeen is feasible.\n\n==Get around==\n\n\n\n\n\n===On foot===\nWalking is an excellent way to get around Aberdeen, particularly around central areas, as the city centre is relatively compact. Walking is also by far the best way to appreciate the grand architecture of the city. However, the city is not ''that'' small (e.g. Union Street is one mile long) so for journeys outside of the city centre, wheeled transport may be useful.\n\nAberdeen has a mediaeval layout like many cities in the UK, so for the first-time visitor, a map is helpful. There are quite a few of these on signs around the city centre, mainly in points of interest (e.g. the Castlegate). However, it is very useful to have a map of the city to carry with you. You can buy maps from the Tourist Information Centre on the corner of Union Street and Shiprow, or from city bookstores.\n\n===By bus===\n\nMost city buses are operated by [https://www.firstbus.co.uk/aberdeen First Aberdeen]. Pay on entry by cash (no change given), contactless bank card or mTicket. In 2021 the single fare by cash is adult £1.70, child £1.25; a day ticket is adult £4.40, child £2.60. These don't include night buses, or the Park &amp; Ride which is £3.60. \n\nThe mTicket (for day tickets or longer) doesn't save much, but avoids fumbling for the right change. You buy online or at Paypoint outlets, and display it on your phone.\n\nUseful routes are Buses 1 and 2 from Robert Gordon University in the south, through Union Square transport hub, then north up King St to Bridge of Don, Old Aberdeen and the University of Aberdeen.\n\nStagecoach run the buses to other towns across Aberdeenshire, see \"Get in\" options for each town. These are sometimes better for edge-of-city transport.\n\n=== By taxi ===\nTaxis wait at the railway station, Back Wynd (off central Union Street), Chapel St (west end of Union St), Hadden Street (off Market Street) and at the airport. They're saloons or people-carriers of any colour, not London-style black cabs. Taxis and drivers must be registered with the City Council and carry an official registration plate, which is usually on the back. \n\nThe main taxi companies are [https://aberdeen-taxis.com/ Aberdeen Taxis] +44 1224 200200 and [https://www.rainbowcitytaxis.com/ Rainbow City] +44 1224 878787. Uber does not operate here.\n\nFares are regulated: in Jan 2022 it's £2.40 for the first 950 yards then 20p for every 180.5 yards, so reckon £3.40 for the first mile and £2 per subsequent mile. \n\nGood luck finding one when the pubs are closing: at night taxis won't pick up waifs and strays flagging them in the street. So either queue at a rank or phone, and be prepared for a long wait either way.\n\n=== By bicycle ===\nThis is fraught in city centre traffic, where walking is first choice, but more helpful further out. [https://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/services/roads-transport-and-parking/cycling-aberdeen Aberdeen City Council] publishes a map of local cycle routes, which is also available in public libraries and at council offices. See below for the Deeside Way cycling and walking route to Banchory and Ballater. \n\nBike hire is available from [https://www.macdui-bike-adventures.com/ Macdui] or BeCycle.\n\nThere isn't a bike-share scheme. Bike lockers at the Park &amp; Rides are for a year's hire, so they're designed for regular commuters not brief visitors.\n\n==See==\n\n\n\n\n* '''Granite architecture''' is the defining feature of the city, though much is showing its age. See Read above for more on city architecture. Highlights are: \n:* '''Union Street''' has a mile-long stretch: but look up, the street frontage in many places is modern. Town House (city hall) is a confident Victorian example. Each building has its own style and scale, it's not like, say, Grey Street in Newcastle upon Tyne with a unified style. \n:* '''Marischal College''' on Broad Street has been nicely cleaned up. It was acclaimed by Betjeman as \"tower on tower, forests of pinnacles, a group of palatial buildings rivalled only by the Houses of Parliament at Westminster\". \n:* '''Castlegate''' has the baronial Salvation Army Citadel.\n:* '''Rosemount Viaduct''' has the elegant cluster of His Majesty's Theatre, St Mark's Church and the Central Library. \n\n* \n*  stretches for two miles from Footdee by the harbour and mouth of the Dee to Donmouth near Old Aberdeen. It's sandy and popular for surfing and windsurfing; you'll need a wet suit as the North Sea is ''cold'' (not that you'd guess from those iconic 1920s railway publicity posters). It's flanked by an Esplanade, good for walking or running. The south Footdee end has a funfair, ice rink, and leisure centre, plus city facilities such as restaurants and a cinema. The quieter north end is flanked by King Links golf course and ends at the Donmouth wildlife reserve.\n*  (pronounced \"Fitty\") is a well-preserved fishing village laid out in 1809, in a pleasing unity of style. The name is a conflation of \"St Fittick\", \"Foot of Dee\" (ie the estuary) and \"Fish Town\".\n*  is the headland south of the Dee estuary. Torry Battery guarding the harbour entrance was built in medieval times. In 1860 it was re-fortified against no-one in particular, and got to fire its guns just once, in 1941, against two friendly approaching vessels that failed to identify themselves. The Ness ends with the 1833 Stevenson Lighthouse, which has a range of 25 miles and was automated in 1991. Nigg Golf Club plays on the Ness, see below. \n* '''Duthie Park''' is a pleasant green space on the north bank of the Dee. Its highlight is the Winter Gardens. \n* \n* \n* \n===Museums and galleries===\n\n* \n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n=== Old Aberdeen === \n*  is the most attractive part of the city, home to the University of Aberdeen's King's College Campus, but it's a misnomer. It was chartered as a burgh in 1489, later than the medieval city centre, but called \"Aulton\", the town by the pool, which morphed into \"old town\". Get here on Bus 1 or 2 from Union St or Bus 20 from Broad St. The core of it is along High Street. \n*  are a pair of minaret-cum-chesspiece-cum-candlesticks, erected in 1834 as the entrance to a genteel estate, and now the gateway to university Halls of Residence. \n*  was consecrated in 1509; its Crown Tower is a symbol of the city and of the university. It has a well-preserved medieval interior.\n* \n* \n* \n* \n*  is on The Chanonry, the northern continuation of High St. It's mostly from 1530, and was built larger but partly collapsed. It's Church of Scotland and a \"High Kirk\", not actually a cathedral, as the C of S doesn't have bishops. \n* '''Cathedral Walk''' north of St Machar's crosses the park to the student village in a loop of the river.\n\n== Do ==\n\n* '''What's on?'''

There is the usual motley crowd of drunks, beggars, rough sleepers and sex workers. Aggressive drunks are the main hassle, especially at weekends: the centre is heavily policed but trouble can flare in a moment. Some drunks are capable of assaulting lampposts that they reckon have looked at them amiss, so English football colours are a red rag to a bull. Above all don't be drunk or drugged yourself.\n\nAreas to avoid, especially after dark, are Tillydrone (north of Bedford Road and east of St Machar Drive) and Torry (the south bank of River Dee).\n\n== Connect ==\n\nAs of Oct 2021, city centre has 5G from all UK carriers.

It's a long way north - the coastline around Fraserburgh is further north than Newfoundland - but it's mostly lowland, fertile and productive, having more in common with the central belt of Scotland than with the Highlands. To the west rise the Grampian Mountains, with the scenic River Dee flowing out. \n\nThis page describes the historic or traditional county, but as elsewhere in Britain, administrative boundaries have chopped and changed. The City of Aberdeen now forms its own metropolis, with a population in 2020 of 490,000. The rest is the local government county of Aberdeenshire, with a 2019 population of 263,000, yet its county seat is still the city.\n\n== Towns and villages ==\n\n\n*  is built of grey granite. Its most interesting areas are around Union Street and \"Old Aberdeen\" a couple of miles north. Lots of museums, galleries and visitor amenities, and it's the transport focus for the county. \n*  is a commuter town just west. \n\nThe county's red sandstone reaches the coast in a line of cliffs, interspersed with small fishing ports, where whaling and herring fishing were once major industries:\n*  15 miles south of Aberdeen has the clifftop ruins of Dunnottar Castle.\n* Then comes Aberdeen itself. North are  and Cruden Bay.\n*  and  are fishing ports.\n\nHere the coastline turns west along the Moray Firth. \n*  has red sandstone cliffs, rows of prettily-painted traditional fishermen's cottages and a beach. \n* , with neighbouring Macduff, has Banff Castle and Adam-designed Duff House.\n*  has a well-preserved old harbour and the ruins of Findlater Castle.\n\nThe A96 crosses the top of the county between Aberdeen and Elgin, through gently rolling countryside and farmland. Small places in this triangle include:\n*  and  are commuter towns for the city. East, towards Ellon and Methlick, is Tolquhon Castle, while to the north is Fyvie Castle.\n*  has grand Haddo House and what's left of Gight Castle, Byron's ancestral home. \n*  has the ruins of Huntly castle. \n\nThe River Dee runs out of the Grampian Mountains along a scenic valley, accessed by A93.\n*  is near Drum Castle and Crathes Castle. To the north is Lumphanan, where Macbeth (the real one) made his last stand, and beyond that is Craigevar Castle.\n* The mountains west of here are part of '''Cairngorms National Park'''. Above  is the royal retreat, Balmoral Castle.\n*  is where the main road leaves the valley to climb towards Glenshee then over to Perth, while a lane continues up the valley to scenic Linn of Dee.\n\n== Understand ==\n\n\"Understand\" is what you are not destined to do if addressed in the local \"Doric\", see Talk below.\n\nThe lowland-highland boundary runs from Helensburgh in the southwest to Stonehaven in the northeast, where it funnels the overland routes to a pinch-point guarded by a much-assaulted castle. But north of that, the terrain opens up again. It's low-lying and well-drained upon a bedrock of Old Red Sandstone, with Aberdeen Angus cattle grazing upon grass that looks greener against the bright red soil. In early modern times the cultural boundary advanced a long way north of the geological boundary, and Aberdeenshire developed industries based on agriculture, forestry and North Sea fish — especially herring, the \"silver darling\".\n\nTo the west rise the Grampian mountains, cloud-wreathed, granite and ill-drained, with poor soil. These were the badlands until the Victorians romanticised them, the Queen herself had a retreat at Balmoral, and sporting guns boomed out against the grouse and deer. Anyone who was wealthy and needed a comfortable base to collect his farm rents while impressing the salons of London with his credentials as a Clan Chieftain would need a castle in Aberdeenshire, so there are lots and lots of these. The railways put tourism within reach of a mass market. Meanwhile the granite was quarried to rebuild Aberdeen, which had suffered far too many fires in its wooden buildings, creating the grey city landscape you see today.\n\nThe city and county declined in the 20th century, but then oil and gas were discovered in the North Sea, and from 1970 Aberdeen became a boom town. The oil was far offshore and wasn't brought here, rather the city's role was to be the support base for exploration and extraction, with a stream of helicopters chattering overhead to ferry workers to and from the rigs. Industry blossomed and property prices became silly; but beyond the city commuter belt the rest of Aberdeenshire was little affected. That industry is now in its sunset years but enough of the wealth has spread around to make the city and county a culturally rich destination.\n\n== Talk ==\n\nAberdeenshire is culturally lowland, and Gaelic largely died out by the 19th century. The everyday language was English with a unique Scottish dialect known as \"Doric\". This was especially dense in Buchan, the rural triangle bounded by the North Sea coast as it turns the corner at Fraserburgh. Doric was mocked as uncouth ''teuchtar'', and its name probably began as a snooty Edinburgh joke. Edinburgh was dubbed the Athens of the North, and ancient Athenians spoke Attic Greek and couldn't understand the country bumpkins of Corinth and Sparta who spoke Doric Greek, and therefore.... \n\nIf you hear Doric in the city nowadays, it's probably being used ironically or as a badge of identity, like Cockney or Geordie. Its vocabulary is much the same as standard Scots: \"aye\" for yes, \"wee\" for small, \"gie\" for give, \"hoose\" for house and so on. What's distinctive is the pronunciation, especially the substitution of \"f\" for \"wh\". So you might hear:\n\n: - \"Fit like?\" - how are you?, to which you reply \"Nae bad, yersel?\"\n: - \"Fit?\" is what?, \"fa?\" is who?, \"fan?\" is when? and \"far\" is where? as in \"Far aboot ye fae?\", where are you from?\n: - \"Da ken\" - don't know - may be used instead of the standard Scots \"dinnae ken\".\n: - \"Hay min\" - excuse me good sir?\n: - \"Foos yer doos?\" - how are you? - literally \"how are your pigeons?\", to which you reply \"Aye, peckin awa\". This exchange is always ironic, as Aberdeenshire no longer relies on pigeons for meat, amusement or communication.\n\nDoric versions of Greek are still spoken and recognised as precious cultural heritage, so Doric Aberdonians might feel aggrieved that their own traditions are scoffed at: it'll be no use canonising the language once it's dead and gone. There are no translation apps, and inviting Google to detect language with ''Foos yer doos?'' gets \"Duh... maybe Tamil?\" When the first Bible translations into local Doric appeared from 2012, these came 15 years behind translations into Klingon.\n\n== Get in ==\n\n'''Aberdeen''' is the transport hub for the county, with good air, rail and road connections, and car ferries to Orkney and the Shetland Islands.\n\nIn 2019 the A90 was re-routed west of Aberdeen, with the opening of the \"Aberdeen Western Peripheral Road\" to relieve the congested A92.  \n\nFor the north end of the county along the Moray Firth, another approach is via '''Inverness''' and Elgin.\n\n== Get around ==\nBuses radiate out from Aberdeen to all the towns along the east coast, inland up the Dee valley, and northwest towards Banff. They also ply along the north coast. You can also use the train between Aberdeen and Stonehaven. Beyond that, there is very little cross-country transport, you'll need a car.\n\n== See ==\n* '''Castles: Balmoral''' on the road up the valley above Ballater is a grandiloquent Victorian pile of a castle, the prototype of the \"Scottish Baronial\" style, all mock-turrets and stags heads looming over the stairways. Completed in 1856, it remains the Royal Family's summer holiday home.\n* Among the many other castles are Dunottar at Stonehaven; Crathes, Craigevar and Drum castles around Banchory, and Tolquhon and Fyvie around Ellon.\n* '''Peterhead Prison''' was notoriously bleak and harsh. It's now a museum.\n* '''Tiny fishing villages''' include Gardenstown, Crovie and Pennan which is the one with the red phone box in the film ''Local Hero''.\n* '''[https://scotlandsgardens.org/ Scotland's Gardens]''' opens up private gardens once a year in summer, with all proceeds going to charity.

Pipe bands, caber-tossing, field and track events, and so on; they're often combined with Agricultural Shows. The [https://scotlandwelcomesyou.com/scottish-highland-games/ full calendar] is posted online.\n\n* '''Ski''' at Glenshee or Lecht.

To date only one is owned by that fellow Trump, but he's clearly destined for greater things.\n\n== Eat ==\n\n* Aberdeen has the widest choice of cuisine and price range.\n* The small towns go for cheap and cheerful fare such as fish &amp; chips. They often have an Indian, an Italian and a takeaway Chinese to add variety.\n* Carron Fish Bar in Stonehaven claims to have invented the deep-fried Mars Bar, and still serves them. \n* Aberdeen Angus, the local breed of cattle, are prized for their marbled beef. The small odds and ends go into burgers.\n\n== Drink ==\n* Aberdeenshire still has lots of pubs, in spite of their general decline across the country. They're usually open daily till 11PM or later.\n* There are whisky distilleries at Crathie, Portsoy, Macduff, Oldmeldrum and Huntly. They also make gin near Aberdeen, and rum in Banchory. The heartland distilling country is further west, in Moray and the Spey valley, but you'll never be far from a quality dram. Start your research in the nearest supermarket.\n\n== Stay safe ==\nThe natural hazards are because you're on the same latitude as Newfoundland, so conditions on higher ground can become hazardous very quickly, and not just in winter.\n\nThe man-made dangers are probably less here than elsewhere, but exercise usual caution around road use, valuables, and drunks.\n\n== Go next ==\n* Angus just south is often overlooked, but it has the Angus glens and striking Pictish carvings.\n* Southwest to Perth and Kinross — yet because of the line of the geological boundary, this brings you into the Highlands, and very scenic they are.\n* West to Moray, now a small county but once the extensive realm of Macbeth, centred on historic Elgin.\n\n\n\n\n"

Aberdyfi is a holiday resort, traditionally popular with golfers and sailors but also with more adrenaline-driven sportspeople, and is home to ''Britain's Best Beach Donkey''. The village marks the southern edge of the Snowdonia National Park.

Eventually this leads to the mythical '''Bearded Lake''' (''Llyn Barfog''), scene of a battle between King Arthur and a monster called the ''Afanc''. Arthur's horse left its hoofprint in a nearby rock known as ''Carn March Arthur''. The lake is also the scene of another well-known legend regarding a local farmer and his herd of magic fairy cows.

That county straddles the Highland / Lowland divide, and Aberfeldy is scenically very much in the central Highlands. Set on the banks of the River Tay, it grew up as a resort town in the 19th century. Since the 20th century the area has been mined for baryte, an ingredient of drill fluid in the oil industry, but it's small scale and hasn't marred the scenery.\n\nNear Aberfeldy you can also visit the village of '''Dull'''. Because someone has to.\n\n== Get in ==\n\nBy road from Edinburgh or Glasgow follow the motorway past Perth, then A9 north onto A827. \n\n[http://www.stagecoachbus.com/Strathtay/ Stagecoach] Bus 23 runs every two hours M-Sa from Perth (Scotland) | Perth via Birnam and Dunkeld to Aberfeldy, 90 min.

Dull is three miles away and you need a car to reach the path for Schiehallion ten miles away.\n\nSweeney's Bus 91 plies between Aberfeldy and Kenmore twice M-F around 9AM and 4PM. It usually runs along the main road and takes 15 min, but some days makes a loop through Weem, Dull, Coshieville, Fortingall and Fearnan to Kenmore. Stagecoach Bus 892 similarly makes an occasional school run up the B-road from Aberfeldy to Coshieville then returns the same way.\n\n== See ==\n*  spans the Tay. Highland roads at the start of the 18th century were often little better than cattle tracks, struggling through fords and bogs. In 1715 the Jacobite rebellion rocked the government; it was quashed, but showed the need to be able to move troops swiftly into troublesome districts. General George Wade (1673-1748), as Scotland's military commander, set about building better roads and bridges. The Crieff to Dalnarcardoch road, built in 1730, crossed the Tay at Aberfeldy by this impressive bridge. Designed by William Adam, it was the most expensive structure in the whole network, and was only completed in 1734. When Wade retired, his assistant Major William Caulfeild took over, building many roads later credited to Wade, and coining the lines quoted above. Meanwhile the Jacobites rebelled again, and this time got as far south as Derby: bless these new roads! \n*  links two sections of the golf course. The name is an ironic nod to the great William McGonagall, who wrote numerous doggerel odes about the Tay and much else, but his [http://www.famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/william_topaz_mcgonagall/poems/5567 poem about Aberfeldy] is sublimely awful even by his exacting standards.\n* \n\n* '''The League of Extraordinary Communities''': well one of them, not to overdo the excitement. '''Dull''' is a tiny farming community straggling along the B846 three miles west of Aberfeldy. There was a monastery in the 7th century; various associated carvings and grave slabs are now in the NMS in Edinburgh. There's nothing here nowadays. But in 2012 Dull began trading on its name, linking up with the town of Boring near Portland Oregon. You can image the T-shirts, the photo-ops, the mugs. In 2013 the town of Bland, New South Wales got in on the act, so these three market themselves as the \"League of Extraordinary Communities\" of Dull, Boring and Bland. Take a photo of the village sign, press \"share\", your work here is done.\n*  is a scenic but little-visited glen 8 miles west of Aberfeldy. Follow B846 beyond Dull, passing Comrie Castle (the masonry stump of a 16th century tower house) to Coshieville. Here the B-road climbs north out of the valley towards Schiehallion, Loch Tummel and Loch Rannoch, while a narrow lane stays along the River Lyon. It winds through Fortingall, where the yew tree in the graveyard is believed to be well over 2000 years old, but there is no sense to be made of the hoaky legend that Pontius Pilate was born here. The lane continues upstream for many a lonely mile behind Ben Lawers, before eventually looping south over the hills to rejoin the main road at Killin at the head of Loch Tay.\n*  is by the A827.

April-Oct there are boat trips by [https://www.lochtaysafaris.net/ Loch Tay Safaris]. A827 continues west along the sunlit north bank of the loch, with access to Ben Lawers.

It's a Munro of 1083 m (3553 ft) which looks volcanic but is quartzite polished by glaciation. Its shape made its volume easy to calculate, so in 1774 it was used to estimate the earth's mass and gravity by the deflection of a nearby pendulum. It's a popular ascent, usually from the car park at Brae of Foss, a 3-mile trail.\n* '''Climb Ben Lawers''', a Munro of 1214 m (3983 ft) brooding over Loch Tay, with alpine / arctic habitat on its upper slopes. Early geologists supposed that after a first volcanic phase of the earth's formation, later rocks were laid down by sedimentation.

Aberystwyth, called the true capital of Wales by some, is a smallish town on the Ceredigion coast, just below the Aberdyfi|Dyfi estuary.  Aberystwyth has a fairly unique student atmosphere – during term-time the vast majority of young adults are undergraduates and the remoteness of the location creates a more vibrant social life than experienced on most campuses.\n\n==Understand==\n\nPolitically, it's in the heart of Nationalist Wales, and is the birthplace of Cymdeithas Yr Iaith Gymraeg, the Welsh phrasebook|Welsh Language movement. It is home to one of the oldest parts of '''[http://www.ucas.ac.uk/instit/i/a40.html the University of Wales]''', which is attended by some 9,000 students. It is also home to '''[http://www.llgc.org.uk/ the National Library of Wales]''', one of the UK's few copyright libraries, meaning it has the right to claim a copy of every book published in Britain, which also means that it has one of the highest figures for books per head of population in the world. Its other notable – and notorious – feature is the remarkable number of pubs in the town.\n\nGenerations of first-year studying abroad|students have been brought up on the promise of a pub for every week of the year. This is true in that there are over 61 locations with public bars in the small Welsh town.\n\n===Visitor information ===\nA good place to start is the Tourist Information Centre at the seafront end of Terrace Road.\n\n* [https://www.visitwales.com/destinations/mid-wales/ceredigion-cardigan-bay/insiders-guide-aberystwyth Visit Wales web page for Aberystwyth]\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By train===\n (or 'Aber') is at the end of the line, in many senses of the phrase. Direct trains run from Birmingham International station (Birmingham Airport and the NEC). 2 hours from Shrewsbury (Shropshire)|Shrewsbury, 3 from Birmingham (England)|Birmingham. A branch line from Machynlleth provides connections to the coastal towns of West Gwynedd.\n\nServices are provided by [https://tfw.wales/ Transport for Wales].\n\n===By car===\n\nThere are two main routes to Aber by road: '''the A44''' comes from the east, and the '''A487''' goes north to south through the town. The best way to get there from any particular point is a subject of much debate. Buy a map and have fun. Minimum 3 hours from Birmingham (England)|Birmingham, 2 hr 40 min from Cardiff, 2 hr 5 min from Swansea - highly dependent on the number of tractors on the roads.There is also a '''[http://www.parkandride.net/ceredigion/ceredigion_frameset.shtml Park and Ride facility]'''.\n\n===By bus===\n'''TrawsCymru's''' T1 service provides a regular link with Carmarthen and Aberystwyth. The X32 is the northern equivalent, providing a link to such exciting places as Machynlleth, Dolgellau and Bangor (Wales)|Bangor at least twice a day.

Birmingham () is most useful for Aberystwyth. It's about 3 hr 30 min away by direct train.\n\n==Get around==\n\nAber is a very compact town; '''walking''' is by far the easiest way to get around.\n\nIf you require motorised transport, '''taxis''' are plentiful and relatively cheap.\n\n'''[https://www.aberystwyth.gov.uk/en/transport/bus-services Buses]''' also run up Penglais Hill (where the main university campus is) and to Llanbadarn Fawr (the other campus, and the Morrisons supermarket - largest of its ilk locally).\n\n'''Parking''' is a problem in the centre of Aber, but a Park and Ride operates from Park Avenue, with a free bus service every 15 minutes M-Sa.\n\n==See==\n\n*The best thing to see in the town is probably the sunset. The '''view over Cardigan Bay''' on a summer's evening can be quite stunning. The best places to see the sunset are the long seafront Promenade (see also: Drink), any of the beaches that takes your fancy, the University Plaza and the Arts Centre cafe above.\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Do==\n\n*The main pastime in Aber, at least for its student population, is drinking (i.e. 'the lash'). There are many fine public houses in the town, and many grotty ones, too. See 'Drink' for more details.\n*If walking's your thing, then the countryside around Aber is beautiful. A '''popular walk''' is to Borth, about 5 miles up a hilly coastal path, which blessed with wonderful beaches. At the northern tip of Borth is Ynyslas, home to a nature reserve of sand dunes and a submerged forest. A short trip out of town by car or bus is '''Tywyn#Outdoor_Pursuits|Cadair Idris''' a popular hiking spot with spectacular view (if the weather is good).\n*'''Watersports''' are another popular activity, but it's probably advisable to take part in organised outings as far as these go. The Irish Sea is famous for its undertow, and most years at least one foolhardy person gets sucked out to sea - usually after a drinking session.\n*There are also '''boat trips''' out into Cardigan Bay, where dolphins can be seen in the waters, and seals on the islands. These are seasonal, so check at the tourist information centre for latest times and prices. '''Sea Fishing''' excursions can also be arranged in the harbour, a great day out with all equipment included in the charter.\n* '''Football:''' [https://www.atfc.org.uk/ Aberystwyth Town] (\"The Seasiders\") play soccer in the Cymru Premier League. That's the top tier within Wales, but mostly amateur and on a par with England's fifth tier National League. They play at Park Avenue (capacity 5000) next to the mainline railway station. \n* \n* \n\nAberystwyth, and the region east to the Cambrian Mountains, provides and excellent base for cycling. The range of terrain ensures that there is something for any level of ability or appetite. The Ystwyth Trail follows a disused railway track and is easy going. The Rheidol Cycleway takes you along country lanes from Aberystwyth to Devil's Bridge, with an optional strenuous climb at the end for those who like a challenge. For adrenaline junkies, there is mountain biking in Nant yr Arian Forest.\n\n== Buy ==\n* '''[https://www.aberystwythfarmersmarket.co.uk/ Farmers Market]''' is nowadays held in the former bus depot on Park Ave. first and third Saturday of the month.\n\n==Eat==\n* \n* \n* \n* \n*\n\n==Drink==\n* \n*\n*\n* \n* \n*\n* \n\n==Sleep==\n===Budget===\n* \n* \n\n===Mid-range===\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Splurge===\n* \n* \n* \n\n==Stay safe==\n\nAberystwyth offers a very safe environment and is probably one of the few places remaining in Britain where an unlocked door doesn't guarantee burglary.\n\nFriday and Saturday nights can be a bit boisterous during the summer, though incidences of drink related violence are still far less than in large cities.\n\nAlso, the sea can be a cruel mistress (see above: Glengower Hotel).\n\n==Go next==\n*Devil's Bridge\n*Ponterwyd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

With a population of around 4,000,000 people, it is the second largest city in West Africa after Lagos City|Lagos and has historically been the economic power base of the region.\n\nFollowing the death of long term president-for-life Felix Houphouët Boigny in 1993, the fortunes for Abidjan changed a great deal and successive coups d'etats in Cote d'Ivoire caused a massive exodus of the foreigners living there. Today, despite the current political issues in Cote d'Ivoire at large, Abidjan remains the economic and de facto capital of the country. Even after everything that's happened, it still boasts a large selection of restaurants, hotels, sites and other reasons to visit. For those travelling through West Africa, it is a must-see city with one of the liveliest night scenes to be found for 1,000 km.\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By plane===\n*  Port Bouët Airport | url=http://www.abidjan-aeroport.com | email=\n| address= | lat=5.261417 | long=-3.925778 | directions=\n| phone= | tollfree=\n| hours= | price=\n| wikidata=Q1165280\n| lastedit=2019-11-14\n| content=\n}}\nAbidjan is well-connected internationally with regular flights on:\n* [http://www.turkishairlines.com Turkish Airlines] from Istanbul\n* [http://www.airfrance.com Air France] from Paris\n* [http://www.brusselsairlines.com/ Brussels Airlines] from Brussels\n* [http://www.emirates.com/ Emirates] from Dubai (via Accra, no change of aircraft)\n* [http://www.kenya-airways.com/ Kenya Airways] from Nairobi (also continues to Dakar on the same aircraft)\n* [http://www.ethiopianairlines.com/ Ethiopian Airlines] from Addis Ababa (continues to Newark, New Jersey|Newark on the same aircraft)\n* [https://www.flytap.com/ TAP Portugal] from Lisbon.\n\n\nThe easiest way to get a visa is to [https://snedai.com/e-visa/ apply online]. You'll get an answer in less than 48 hours. The process at the airport is fast and simple.\n\n===By road===\nThe roads to Abidjan are quite good despite their maintenance not being kept up as much as it should.  Traffic lights all but disappear once outside of Abidjan though, so driving outside of the city can be challenging.  Whether you're in a private car, taxi, or gbaka (the shared minibuses) you will be stopped at various official (and unofficial) checkpoints where they will delay you at the very least and try to shake down a bribe at the worst.  Abidjan also serves as a terminus for long haul bus lines from Bamako, Mali, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, and Accra, Ghana.\n\nIf you are travelling from Nigeria, Ghana, Benin, Liberia and Togo, [http://www.ysgtransport.com YSG Transport], [http://www.chiscotransport.com Chisco Transport], Union Transport de Bouake ([http://www.utbci.net UTB Transport]), and STC Transport are good recommendations.\n\nOther travelers from Nigeria can get to Abidjan and nearby West African capitals through the weekly transport system of Ejigbo, Osun State, Nigeria, International Travel Buses. They have daily and weekly travel scheme of an uninterrupted borderless travels from Nigeria to Cote d'Ivoire. Some of the travel organizers include Bully Orelope, Atanda 'Agee\" Rambo Transport (also known as IRT), Laba Transport, anc STC Transport. You can get to Ejigbo, Osun State from all Lagos' inter-city bus terminus, and from Osogbo.\n\n===By train===\n\nThe only train connection to Abidjan is from Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso with stop-overs in Bouake and Bobo-Dioulasso as well as some smaller cities. While a possibly interesting ride that should take 36 hours, the schedule is quite unreliable and journeys are known to have taken a much longer time. There are about two weekly departures.  (''Gare d'Abidjan'') is situated in the central Le Plateau-district, next to Place De La Republique.\n\n==Get around==\n\n\nAbidjan is quite spread out so walking can take a lot of time and bicycle riding isn't the safest choice (except nearer the water in Zone Quatre).  However, there are many options to get around via motor transport.\n\n===By taxi===\n\nThey have a taxi system that involves two types of car taxis. The first type that most visitors will encounter are the orange (or red-orange) ones. These are legally able to operate anywhere in the city and you will most likely be able to ride solo in them. They are also the most expensive. A ride from the airport will run most people (especially non-Africans who speak little French) about 5,000 CFA, even to districts that are just 3&amp;nbsp;km away. If you're willing to haggle a lot (the drivers will often complain that they have to pay a fee to pick up passengers there, which is a lie) you may be able to get it to CFA 3,500 or 2,500. A ride between two distant districts such as Zone Quatre and Plateau will be about CFA 2,000.\n\nThe other type of taxi is color-coded to operate in a specific neighbourhood, such as the green taxis you'll see in an area such as Koumassi and Treichville. Yellow taxis in Cocody municipal areas, Blue in Marcory, Yopougon and Abobo. These are significantly cheaper, but will most likely have to be shared and of course the distance they can travel is limited to a single neighbourhood.\n\nTravel books often make allusion to some taxis having meters. If they do (and this is rare), they are never working and you always, always agree on the price prior to departure. According to Africa Travelogue, they can only be found at the Zone 4 (Industriel) areas, because of the High level of the Expat community of Europeans living in Zone 4.\n\n====Ride hailing====\n[https://yango.yandex.com/abidjan/tariff?lang=en Yango] ride hailing app works in Abidjan.\n\n===By bus===\n\nThere are several bus routes throughout the city.  They are cheap and decently reliable, although they are often incredibly crowded due to insufficient numbers.  Some of the bus stations can be overwhelming though, such as Adjame which, for those new to travel in West African cities will be a lot to handle. There is also the threat of pickpockets in these crowded areas.\n\n===By motorcycle===\n\nIn 2010, the Ivorian government relaxed import restrictions on small motorcycles.  Prior to this, the number of motorcycles you would see on the street was negligible and there were absolutely none acting as taxis as it was illegal.  Times are changing on this front, but be forewarned that going about Abidjan on the back of a moto is probably the number one way to die during travels, although it is cheap.\n\n===By boat===\n\nIf you just need to cross the lagoon and can make use of one of the ferry routes, by all means take it.  While the lagoon is polluted in some parts, it's still a wonderful ride and gazing at the Abidjan skyline from the water at sunset is delightful.\n* You can take a ferry from the  It takes 15 minutes and costs only CFA 150 to get you to \n\n=== By train ===\nA commuter railway system is under construction, the first section is expected to open in 2025.\n\n==See==\n\nImage:Musee_civilisations_Abidjan.jpg|thumb|Exhibitions in the Museum of Civilizations.\n\nAbidjan is sometimes referred to as the \"Paris of West Africa\". During the long and stable rule of the Ivory Coast's Godfather Félix Houphouët-Boigny the city of Abidjan has flourished. However, the political instability and the civil war of the past decade have taken their toll on the city. Neglect, low maintenance of buildings and public space and the mass exodus of foreigners have given the city an atmosphere of \"lost glory\". Nowhere is this to be seen better than in the famous Hotel Ivoire. Entering it is like taking a trip to the 1960s; since its construction there have been no significant changes or modernisation to its interior and furniture. Too bad though that its massive swimming pool has weeds growing on the bottom instead of blue waters.\n\nThe public zoo is very nice. It really is a beautiful place with loads of interesting animals for just CFA 200, well worth this small sum.\nAlso don't forget a trip to Bassam, Abidjan's no. 1 beach.\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n=== Museums ===\n* \n* \n* \n\n==Do==\nImage:Plagecocody.jpg|thumb|250px|Beach in the upmarket ''Cocody'' district.\n\n==Buy==\n\n==Eat==\n\nThere are many places to eat Ivorian food, most of them on the sidewalk or on a small road side terrace. Make sure that you ask about the price before you sit down, in order to avoid lengthy discussions about the price when they try to overcharge you after the meal. The staple foods in the Ivory Coast are rice, cassava, yam and bread. Bread is usually eaten at breakfast or as a supplement to the meal. The cassava (manioc) can be eaten cooked whole, as a mash called plakali, mixed with banana (foutou) or fermented then grated (atchèkè). Fish is usually the cheapest meal. European cuisine can be found in the wealthier neighbourhoods such as Plateau, Cocody, Deux Plateaux and Zone 4.\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n==Drink==\nThe number one place to go out at night in Abidjan is Princess Road in Yopougon. There are many bars to just relax and drink and also loads of dancing with live music or deejays. Don't forget to order some fried spicy chicken; they prepare it for you right on the street!\n\nBidul Bar, Havana Club and others are in Zone 4 (''Zone Quatre''). If you do go, be aware of prostitutes that will want to talk to you. Other places are in Treicheville and Cocody but you should have private transportation or a cab. Note the recommended security precautions in the \"Stay safe\" section of this article.\n\n==Sleep==\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Stay safe==\n\nThere are a number of issues that plague Abidjan, which are indicative of the overall problems that Cote d'Ivoire is experiencing.  First and foremost are the military checkpoints. While generally harmless for foreigners, they can make it maddening to get across the city in a timely fashion, especially if one is in a private car. Bribes are commonplace, but not an absolute. Carrying small bills is always a good idea. Otherwise, just agreeing with the officer bothering you is the best course of action. If you're respectful, they'll usually let you be, unless you are French, in which case you will be hassled a good deal more due to the Ivorians having heavy disdain for French involvement in their country.\n\nAlso if in a private car, you'll notice that most people roll through red lights late at night.  While illegal, there have been incidents of carjackings when people are stopped, so heed this warning as you see best.\n\nSomething else to keep in mind is that Cote d'Ivoire literally shuts down at midnight until 05:00.  As a remnant of a curfew imposed during the last civil war, they barricade all the main points of entry and exit to all the towns. If you find yourself on the wrong side of that barricade when it is closed (such as staying in Bassam, but partying in Abidjan) you will absolutely not be let through until 05:00.\n\nPickpockets are a problem in crowded places much like anywhere else in the world. Keep track of your personal items and make sure your bags are well closed when passing through busy bus stations or markets.\n\nWhile the most lively of neighborhoods, places such as Koumassi, Treichville, and Yopougon are probably best avoided unless going there with a local. Yopougon is undoubtedly the safest with the most impressive assortment of street food, but there can also be young, drunken men in these areas who can be looking for trouble. That said, if you're not starting the trouble and try to defuse the situation, you'll probably not have any issues as people in Abidjan are used to an international crowd in their city.\n\nWomen should not go out unaccompanied at night. During the day, you'll have no problems. Ivorian society is most definitely patriarchal, but at the same time, the men are respectful of international women and at times maybe a bit too respectful, giving you a lot more attention than you'd like. If you receive unwanted advances, just do as the local girls do and firmly tell them you're not interested. They'll eventually get the point or move on to other women to \"charm\".\n\n==Cope==\n===Embassies and consulates===\n*  \n*  \n*  \n\n==Go next==\n\n* Abengourou - A small town three hours north where you can have an audience with the king of Indénié Kingdom.\n* Bouaké- The second largest city of Côte d'Ivoire located in the dead center of the country with a lively market and night scene.\n* Grand-Bassam - About 45 minutes to the east and the original capital of the country with old Colonial architecture that is being restored and an excellent beach.\n* Jacqueville - A small, relaxing beach town that sits about an hour from Abidjan with a short, 450-m ferry across the lagoon.\n* San Pedro (Côte d'Ivoire)|San Pedro - An old town about six hours west of Abidjan with nice beaches which serves as a secondary port city for the country.\n\n\n\n"

It is a busy market town with a good choice of shops, pubs and restaurants. It sits aside the River Thames and having an attractive County Hall.\n\n== Understand ==\n\nAbingdon was the county town of Berkshire until 1870, and became part of Oxfordshire when local government was re-organised in 1974.   It was the home of MG motor cars which used to be built at the MG Works, which is now a business centre. However, Jerome K Jerome in his book ''Three Men in a Boat'' described Abingdon as a 'dull market town'.\n\nEach year the centre of the town is closed off (twice) for two fairs.  The '''Michaelmas Fair''' takes place early each Oct (legally the last Monday &amp; Tuesday before 11 Oct). Ock Street, High Street and the Market Place are closed off and the fair is thought to be the longest street fair in Europe. In medieval times the fair was intended as a hiring fair for farm workers, these days it's rides, ferris wheels, and more traditional fairground rides and stalls. Then follows the unusual tradition a week or so later of the '''Runaway Fair'''.  A smaller fair, the history of the Runaway Fair was that it provided an opportunity for those who were hired by cruel masters or found poor working conditions from the earlier Michaelmas Fair could \"runaway\" and find better employment before the winter.\n\nThe town has a unique historic tradition of '''Bun Throwing''' dating back over 400 years. In practice it is a bit of a cross between a ceremony and a \"bun fight\". Held when the Town Council votes to hold one and generally to celebrate a royal occasion.  One was held to celebrate the 2011 Royal Wedding, and another in 2012 to mark the Royal Jubilee. Councillors in full ceremonial robes chuck around 4000 currant buns from the top of County Hall down at the chanting crowds filling the market place below. The buns are specially baked for the occasion with a crown design on the top. The buns are often fought for and preserved by local families and visitors. If your visit happens to be at the same time as a royal occasion check the [http://www.abingdon.gov.uk Town Council Website] in case such a rare ceremony has been scheduled.\n\n===Visitor information ===\n* \n\n==Get in==\n=== By road ===\nThe town lies on the A34 main road (running Winchester (England)|Winchester to Salford via Birmingham (England)|Birmingham). 17 miles south of the town the A34 connects to the M4 motorway (London to Swansea) and 18 miles north of the town the A34 connects to the M40 motorway (London to Birmingham (England)|Birmingham)\n\n=== By rail ===\nThe nearest station is Radley, however, trains run more frequently to Oxford.

Abisko is near many great national parks and hosts a trailhead on the spectacular Kungsleden hiking trail; at the same time, it is on the ''malmbanan'' railway between Narvik in Norway and Luleå, which means it can be reached by an overnight train from Stockholm quite easily. Abisko village is around the train station \"Abisko Östra\". The large and well equipped hostel/hotel \"Abisko turiststation\" lies at the train station of the same name, 2 km further west.\n\nTorneträsk, on the shore of which Abisko is located, is the sixth largest and second deepest lake of Sweden, and the largest fell lake in Scandinavia.\n\n==Get in==\n\n\n===By car===\nAbisko is 80 km east of Narvik and 100 km north-west of Kiruna.

These include logging, mining all along the rich geologic Cadillac Fault between Val-d'Or and Rouyn-Noranda, as well as agriculture.\n\nThe region's landscape features mixed forest to the south across the Témiscamingue area which falls within the St. Laurence watershed of southern Quebec, while boreal forest covers the Abitibi section further north in the Hudson Bay watershed of northern Quebec.\n\nThe southern part of the region has a humid continental climate, while the northern part has more of a sub-arctic climate due to its latitude and its proximity to Hudson Bay and the Arctic.\n\n===History===\n\nAlgonquins inhabited the region when the French arrived. The first land expeditions were made in 1670 by Radisson as part of the development of the fur trade industry across the Hudson Bay region and through most of the New France colony. Fort Témiscamingue, located on the east banks of Lake Timiskaming was erected by a French merchant on Anicinabeg lands in 1720. It was an important crossroads of the fur trade along the Hudson Bay trading route.\n\nUntil 1868, Abitibi was owned by the Hudson's Bay Company; it was then purchased by Canada and became part of the North-West Territories. Abitibi was annexed to the province of Quebec in 1898, while Témiscamingue had been part of Lower Canada and so was already part of Quebec at Confederation.\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th century, agriculture and forest industries began to develop in the southern areas. However, the greatest wave of colonization occurred between World War I and World War II when a large population came from urban centres due to the Great Depression. In the 1930s, jobless people were given assistance to move to undeveloped regions of the province, igniting the beginning of the second colonization flow.\n\nThe mining industry, mainly extracting gold and copper, also contributed to the growth of the region when numerous mines were opened. Mining is still the backbone of the region's economy nowadays, along with forestry and agriculture.\n\n==Talk==\nDespite its proximity to Ontario, Abitibi has surprisingly few native English speakers. Most people here speak French, but young people may understand and speak English. Aboriginal languages are spoken increasingly infrequently in reserves.\n\n==Get in==\n===By car===\nFrom Québec:\n* From Montréal, Route 117 passes through the Réserve Faunique de La Vérendrye.\n* From Chibougamau, Route 113 passes via Senneterre\n* From northern Québec (Nord-du-Québec), Route 109 passes via Amos.\n\nFrom Ontario:\n* From Northeastern Ontario, Highway 66 passes from Kirkland Lake, Ontario to Arntfield.

To its east, across the Enguri River, lies Northwestern Georgia. The Greater Caucasus mountain range occupies its northern territory. The coastal lowlands have a subtropical climate. In Abkhazia's small area snow-covered mountains meet beaches, caves and lakes. A long human history has left an architectural and cultural legacy that complements its natural beauty.\n\nAbkhazia was a popular tourist destination back in the Soviet era because of its mild climate, its beaches and interesting nature. The country's tourism infrastructure has been developing again, but so far, it is frequented mainly by tourists from Russia and other CIS countries.\n\n==Cities==\n\n\n*  — capital\n* \n* \n* \n*  (Novy Afon)\n* \n\n==Other destinations==\n*  (or Avadhara) - Abkhazian resort,  from Lake Ritsa, at an altitude of 1,600 m, famous for its mineral springs and sulfide waterfall with sparkling water.\n* - A beautiful region with awe-inspiring mountain trails and turquoise water.\n\n==Understand==\n\nDespite suffering a similar history to South Ossetia, Abkhazia is much more accessible and open to travel. While not many Westerners make the journey here, it has always been a popular destination for Soviet, and now Russian, tourists.\n\n===History===\n\n\nAbkhazia was long part of or related to various Georgian kingdoms until its annexation into the Russian Empire in 1864. When the Democratic Republic of Georgia declared its independence from the empire in 1918, Abkhazia obtained autonomy within the new Georgian republic. After the Soviet annexation of Georgia in 1921, and the formation of the Soviet Union, Abkhazia was included into the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1931 as an autonomous republic. In the late 1980s and early 1990s the Soviet Union was undermined by strong nationalist feelings among its various peoples. The Abkhaz people feared domination by the emerging independent Georgia and sought their own independence. Violent clashes culminated in full-scale war in 1992: 3,000 Georgian troops overtook Abkhazia and dismantled the separatist government. In response the Abkhaz and Russian paramilitaries mounted a major offensive and by 1993 they had driven the Georgians out and had massacred thousands that remained. Abkhazia was ethnically cleansed of its Georgian population, and the survivors who successfully reached Georgian-controlled territory continue to live in poverty with an uncertain future to this day.\n\nAfter the civil war most of Abkhazia, except a few villages in Kodori Gorge, was out of Georgian control. During the 2008 South Ossetian war Abkhaz forces overtook these few remaining villages. Russia recognised the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia after the South Ossetian War in 2008, citing the Western-backed Kosovo independence earlier that year as precedent.\n\nIts status as an independent state is internationally recognized only by Russia, Nauru, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Syria (as well as the other unrecognized states in the Caucasus region. including South Ossetia and Transnistria). The Georgian government, United Nations and the majority of the world's governments consider Abkhazia a part of Georgia's territory. Under Georgia's official designation, it is an autonomous republic with a Tbilisi-recognized autonomous government in exile. Tbilisi does not recognize the legality of the Sukhumi-based Abkhazian government.\n\nAbkhazia very much depends on Russian support and funding, and has an uncertain political situation similar to that of South Ossetia.\n\nThe question of Abkhaz sovereignty is a hot-button issue in Georgia. The Georgian government continues to assert that Abkhazia has long been a fundamental part of Georgia, Abkhazians are an important ethnic group in Georgia, and that Abkhazians belong to Georgia. Most Georgians agree with their government's views and question Russia's close relationship with Abkhaz separatists, arguing that Russia is either seeking to annex Abkhazia or destabilise Georgia. Avoiding such discussions is a good policy.\n\n===Geography===\n\nAbkhazia is south of the Caucasus on the north coast of the Black Sea west of the river Enguri in Georgia. With the exception of a narrow agricultural coastal strip it is a highly mountainous country reaching heights of over 4,000 m.\n\nThere is also the Voronya Cave in the Arabica Massif. At 2,190 m deep, it's the deepest known cave in the world.\n\nThanks to the protection of the mountain ranges, the coastal strip has a subtropical climate, which made Abkhazia a popular resort in the Soviet era. The mild climate promotes the cultivation of tobacco, tea, wine and fruit and agriculture, food and beverage industries are among the most important economic sectors of Abkhazia.\n\n===Climate===\nAbkhazia can have very hot and humid summers and can stay quite warm up until the end of October.\n\nThe average temperature in January is between 2–4°C. The average temperature in August varies from 22–24°C. The average annual temperature is 15°C.\n\n===Demography===\n\nAbkhazia has long been inhabited mainly by the eponymous people of Abkhazia, which represented in 1886 about 85% of the residents of Abkhazia (half of which were Georgianized Abkhazians at the time) on a total population of less than 70,000. There were also small Greek, Armenian and Russian minorities as well as several thousands of Georgians. However, the number of Georgians increased since the 1880s. During the Ottoman-Russian war between 1864 and 1883, a grand migration took place, when large numbers of Muslim Abkhazians emigrated to the Ottoman empire with other Muslim populations of the Caucasus, such as Circassians. Large numbers of Georgians settled on the vacated lands and properties under Russian Tsarist rule. By 1917, Abkhazia counted 167,832 residents, of which 42% Georgian and 21% Abkhaz. This proportion between the ethnic minorities was roughly maintained throughout the Soviet Union era. The last Soviet census of 1989 identified a population of approximately 525,000, of which almost 46% were Georgians and 18% Abkhazians. The rest of the population consisted of Armenians (14.6%), Russians (14.3%), Greeks (2.8%) and some smaller minorities. During all this time, also many Russians, Ukrainians and Armenians settled in the region. The Abkhazians therefore were already a minority in their land at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nDuring the Civil War, there was ethnic cleansing and forced displacement. Approximately 250,000 inhabitants (including approximately 200,000 Georgians) left the region. Some other citizens emigrated later on due to the difficult economic situation. In 2003 the population was only of about 215,000 people. However, since 2008 the situation in Abkhazia continuously improves and the population increases again. According to 2011 census, the country had about 241,000 inhabitants: 50.8% Abkhazians, 19.3% Georgians, 17.3% Armenian, 9.2% Russians, 0.7% Ukrainians, 0.6% Greeks and about 0.8% of other minorities.\n\nA large part of the population has Russian passports, since Abkhaz passports are unrecognized by almost every other state. Many ethnic Georgian residents of Abkhazia are Georgian citizens without Abkhaz citizenship. They are mainly concentrated in the south of the country: in Gal district, they constitute 98.2% of the population; in Tkuartschal district 62.4%; and in Rajon Otschamtschyra district, about 9.5%. In all other parts of the country, the percentage of Georgians is well below 5%.\n\n==Talk==\n\n\nThe two official langauges of Abkhazia are '''Abkhaz phrasebook|Abkhaz''' and '''Russian phrasebook|Russian'''.\n\nAbkhaz phrasebook|Abkhaz is a Northwest Caucasian language and is completely unrelated to any other major language family. Like most Caucasian languages, Abkhaz is characterised by having a very large number of consonants, a complicated grammar, and an irksome phonological system. \n\nRussian phrasebook|Russian is spoken by virtually everyone and is arguably more useful than Abkhaz. Still, learning a few words of Abkhaz will endear you to the locals.\n\nGeorgian phrasebook|Georgian is not widely spoken in Abkhazia. Due to years of conflict with Georgia (country)|Georgia, Abkhazians may be offended if you speak to them in Georgian.\n\n==Get in==\n\n===Visas===\n\nThere are three types of Abkhaz visa: Single-entry (10 days - US$10, 30 days - US$20, 3 months - US$30, 1 year - US$40), Multi-entry (from US$30) and Transit (US$5-50). Official information is available [http://mfaapsny.org/en/consular-service/permission/ online].\n\n====Applying====\nVisa applications are submitted and processed via email. Visas are issued by the Consular Service department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (21 ulitsa Lakoba, Sukhumi, +7 840 226-3948). Download the [http://mfaapsny.org/bitrix/admin/abk_visa_application_form%20v2.doc appropriate form]; once completed, send it to visa@mfaapsny.org, or fill out the [http://mfaapsny.org/en/consular-service/permission/ online form]. Within seven working days you should receive an '''Entry Permit''' via email or fax. The consular staff may be slack and you may need to chase them up with a phone call, so don't leave applying to the last minute.\n\n====Collecting====\nWithin three working days of your arrival in Abkhazia, go to the Ministry of Repatriation (33 ulitsa Sakharova, Sukhum, +7 840 226-70-69, normal office hours with lunch break from 13:00 to 14:00).\n\nThe process here is unexpectedly unbureaucratic: enter room 3 in the ground floor (knock at the door and then enter if not told otherwise), the official will ask you a few questions in Russian or English, you pay in rubles on the spot (400 руб for a ten-day stay in August 2018) and will have your visa handed to you.\n\n===By land===\n\n\n\nThere are two viable land crossings into Abkhazia: from Russia, on the river Psou (near Sochi, via Adler), and from Georgia (country)|Georgia, on the river Enguri/Ingur (near Zugdidi).\n\nEntering from Russia is more \"user-friendly\". This border is crossed by hundreds of people every day. However, you will need a double-entry Russian visa.\n\nMoreover, crossing the Russian-Abkhazian border is considered a '''criminal offence''' by Georgia: an illegal entry into Georgian territory without passing a Georgian immigration checkpoint. This is punishable by a fine, or even prison sentence, which in effect means you cannot transit through Abkhazia from Russia to Georgia, but should instead leave Abkhazia via Russia. While some travellers reported that entering Abkhazia from Georgia before continuing onward to Russia is viable, it's not recommended, because you may be arrested the next time you visit Georgia, since Georgia never registered your exit. If taking this route, take extra care not to leave traces in your passport of any visit to Abkhazia via Psou (Russia).\n\n===From Georgia===\nThere are no exchange facilities or ATMs at the border. Get sufficient rubles in Zugdidi (or, if you arrive straight from Tbilisi, from there), otherwise it may be difficult or overly expensive to obtain transport in Abkhazia.\n\nAbkhazia follows Moscow Time, leading to a one-hour time difference year-round when crossing from Georgia which mobile phones may not automatically pick up on.\n\nFrom the Zugdidi railway station, take a marshrutka (1 lari, Aug 2018) or taxi (10 lari, which can be negotiated down to 8) to the Enguri bridge, get your passport checked by the Georgian police checkpoint and walk across the several hundred metres long, dilapidated bridge to the border checkpoint on the Abkhazian side.\n\nThe Georgian police station has to call Tbilisi to get permission, the office there doesn't open before 10:00 (Aug 2018), so you may have to wait if your arrive early. On the Abkhazian side, there are at least two checkpoints. Present your letter of permission (see below), answer any questions and wait patiently until you are allowed in. The border guards may demand a cursory glance through your luggage.\n\nOn the Abkhazian side you can find taxis (, Oct 2013), marshrutkas (&lt;!-- 2018-08-25 --&gt;) and occasionally a bus to Gal. In Gal you can change to a marshrutka to the capital Sukhumi (, Aug 2018, roughly hourly departures) or share a taxi there which can be negotiated to 1,200 руб for 4; however, a cartel of sorts seems to be in operation, so without knowledge of Russian this may be difficult. Gal's marshrutka station is outside the town, which makes getting a quick look inconvenient. Some marshrutkas continue all the way from the Ingur to Sukhumi. Going back from Sukhum to Ingur (Ингур), direct marshrutkas leave the train station at 09:10 and 11:10, but are often packed and won't take anybody with too much luggage.\n\n===From Russia===\n====By train====\nThere is a year-round daily train from Moscow|Moscow's Kursky Rail Station to Sukhumi. Every second day the train extends to St. Petersburg. From Moscow, it takes less than two days and passes through Adler at about 08:00 and arrives in Sukhumi about two hours later. The return journey starts at about 14:00. In addition there are some local services per day between Sukhumi and Adler stopping at Novy Afon and Gagra. Alternatively, marshrutkas run from Adler railway station, with better connections to the border.\n\n====By bus====\nBuses to Sukhumi run from Sochi and Rostov-on-Don, Russia.\n\n====By foot====\nIf crossing the border on foot from Russia, prepare for long waits in summer (1½–2&amp;nbsp;hr are not uncommon) and bring enough water. Frequent (ancient Ikarus) busses and marshrutkas leave from the parking lot once you have cleared customs.\n\n====By plane====\nWhile Sukhumi has an airport ('''Sukhum Babushara Airport''' ()), unsolved politics prevents its use for regular scheduled flights.\n\n====By boat====\nA high-speed, seasonal daily boat service (running between 10 June and 1 October) links Sochi with Gagra, where it is possible to enter Abkhazia being in possession of a Clearance (see above) indicating the Psou border crossing. The boat leaves at 10:00 from Sochi's ''Morskiy vokzal'' (sea port) (boarding time: 08:30) and arrives at 11:30. In the other direction, it leaves from Gagra at 19:00 (boarding at 18:30), a one-way ticket costs , in Sochi it has to be bought at least one day before leaving, for the way back though, it can be bought on board. From the Gagra port, just walk 100&amp;nbsp;m ahead to the main road to catch a bus for traveling onwards.\n\nAbkhazia is partially under a naval blockade by the Georgian Coast Guard, and its waters are patrolled by Russian Border Guards' Coast Guard. If you are caught by the Georgians, the Georgian authorities will probably investigate whether you are involved in any economic activity, and if they find that you are, you might be prosecuted for unauthorized economic activity with Abkhazia. You may be penalized with a prison term and a heavy fine.\n\n==Get around==\n\n\n===By bus===\nThere are frequent buses and marshrutkas along the coastal road. You will find a bus timetable at the Sukhum Bus Station (in front of the train station).\n\n===By taxi===\nVisitors may also use taxis for travel within the country. Many taxi companies provide special rates for sightseeing. There are a number of travel agencies providing excursions to the mountains using jeeps / four wheel drive cars.\n&lt;br clear=\"right\" /&gt;\n\n==See==\n\n\n\n\nOne interesting destination for travellers is to visit '''Novi Afon''' (Новый Афон) or '''New Athos'''; a Christian Orthodox Cathedral, which is 20&amp;nbsp;min drive from Sukhumi. It is famous not only as a cathedral and living legacy of Christianity but also as a cave; where there are 7-8 enormously large halls with thousands of wonderful of stalagmites and stalactites. A special train takes you to the depths. There are also historical places like the '''village of Moqua''' with its beautiful cathedral, and '''Ilor Church''' near Ochamchira.\n\nAnother attraction is '''Lake Ritsa''', high in the mountains and about 1&amp;nbsp;hour drive from the main road (M-27). On the other side of the lake, '''Stalin's Dacha''' (summer cottage) can be found. The shortest way is by boat, but access is also possible by road (5&amp;nbsp;km). The cottage is open for tourists in the peak season but pulling out a camera will probably occasion a firm warning. Even further up in the mountains is '''Lake Msui''', a bit more off the beaten track; some tour operators offer trips. Weekly local flights from Sukhumi airport can take you to the remote village of '''Pskhu''', where tourists may enjoy fantastic views of mountains and enjoy local produce such as honey and meat.\n\nThe cities of '''Gagra''' and '''Pitsunda''' are the most popular tourist destination, offering a wide range of activities for a vacation.\n\nAbkhazia is one of the oldest Christian countries (Andrew and Simon the Zealot preached here in the 1st century AD). Therefore a number of medieval churches exist. Most notable of them are the temples in the '''villages Lykhny, Kaman, Otkhara'''.\n\n====Lykhny village ====\nIt's the largest and the oldest (more than a thousand years old) village of Abkhazia which can boast of ruins of a 6th-7th century Christian temple (located on ​​the outskirts of the village), princes palace and Church of the Assumption of Our Lady. Lykhny village is located  north of the city Gudaut.\n\n* \n* \n\n====Kaman village ====\nChristian legend states that the holy martyr Basiliscus (308 AD) and St. John Chrysostom (407 AD) died and were buried in this village. Here you can find the ruins of early medieval Christian church, the tomb of the holy martyr Basiliscus, Orthodox Monastery (operating since 2002). Kaman village located  from the city of Sukhumi.\n\n====Otkhara village ====\nDens of a medieval monastery can be found here.\n\n==Do==\nAbkhazia offers a wide variety of activities such as eco-tourism, gastro-tourism, rafting and extreme sports, mountain jogging and snowboarding, diving and sky gliding, hunting, and cultural and religious tourism. Beach season in Abkhazia lasts from May to November.\n\nThese are some things a traveller should try before leaving Abkhazia:\n\n* Visit the Abkhaz Drama Theatre, Botanic Garden and Monkey Park in Sukhumi.\n* Dine at the famous \"Gagripsh\" restaurant in Gagra.\n* Take a boat trip from Gagra to Sukhumi.\n* Visit the small cave of St. Simon the Zealot and the cave in the village Abrskila Otap.\n* Visit the village of Kaman near Sukhumi.\n* Village of Lykhny with its historic churches and dome of Abkhaz Kings.\n\n==Buy==\n===Money===\n\n\nAbkhazia uses the Russian ruble (RUB or ₽) as its currency.\n\nAbkhazia now has ATMs that accept Visa, Mastercard and Maestro cards, they are usually installed near bank branches in all major cities. If the Abkhazian banks do not accept your card try the foreign (i.e. Russian) banks like Sberbank. Upscale shops and restaurants also accept cards.\n\nDespite their presence, ATMs should not be relied upon. Even in Sukhumi, many are frequently out of service, and those that do function often have a 3000&amp;nbsp;руб withdrawal limit, making obtaining large quantities of cash expensive due to fees or impossible. \n\nAmerican travelers should be warned that the standard U.S. chip and signature cards do not work at most places in Abkhazia. Unlike most of Europe, where a U.S. credit card will default to signature verification without PIN functionality, this will result in a charge being declined on an Abkhaz terminal.\n\nFor U.S. travelers, it is strongly recommended to arrive in Abkhazia with sufficient cash in rubles to support their stay. \n\nDollars and euros are accepted in official exchange offices which can be found at most tourist areas—normal banking hours apply. Sometimes, visitors may pay with dollars and euros directly, though at a lower rate.\n\nThere are some 24-hour shops in the villages. Sukhumi has a new shopping center on the outskirts of the city. Otherwise goods can be found in small shops, mini markets and numerous kiosks. The largest grocers in Gagra is called \"Continent\".\n\n==Eat==\nDominant in Abkhazia are the Mediterranean influenced Caucasian and Russian cuisine. It has Mediterranean characteristics due to the abundance of subtropical fruits, vegetables and seafood. Kebabs are offered almost everywhere.\n\nYou should try Abkhazian local dishes including ''Akud'' (bean sauce) and ''Abista'' (corn porridge with cheese) and a variety of meat and fresh greens. Most dishes are usually spicy.\n\n==Drink==\n\nAbkhazia is also a wine region. Local wines are a must try; ''Apsny'', ''Ashta'', ''Buque'', ''Dioskuria'' (ancient Greek name of Sukhumi), ''Gumsta'', ''Lykhni'', ''Psou'', ''Chegem'' and ''Radeda''.\n\nLocal spirits distilled from a dry wine and fruit mash are very diverse and cause stormy enthusiasm among tourists.\n\n==Stay safe==\n\nIn the past, Abkhazia has witnessed military confrontations between Georgian armed forces and the Russian-supported local independence groups. For the common traveller the country is relatively safe, but you should make sure to avoid any place near the border to Georgia. Some minor unregistered minefields are reported near the border, an additional reason to steer well clear of it. Keep in mind that Abkhazia is, in the view of international law, still a part of Georgia. Further military confrontations are unlikely but you should closely follow the international and independent news in case the situation changes.\n\nWhile many travellers cross the border with Georgia proper back and forth with no problems, keep in mind that the southeastern areas of Abkhazia on the way, around Gali, Ochamchira, and Tkvarcheli more specifically, are the most impoverished parts of a country already not doing so well, so the time spent there should be kept no longer than is necessary. The Abkhaz side of the actual border zone at Enguri/Ingur seems safe as long as the militia is there—but note that they leave the place as soon as the crossing gets shut by 19:00. There are several reports of travellers being victims of violent muggings in southeastern Abkhazia.\n\nIf you are not from the few countries that recognize Abkhazia, being in a conflict zone means that you are left stranded with absolutely no consular support should you lose your passport for some reason. In such a case, a traveller reportedly could make it back to Georgia only after the involvement of the Red Cross delegation (48 Inal-Ipa St, Sukhumi) and some high-ranking Abkhaz officials, which may not be available next time. Thus it is recommended to make a copy of the passport and any appropriate visas before entering Abkhazia.\n\nFinding directions might be challenging as all signs are mainly in Cyrillic only.\n\nThe basic precautions for travellers are those recommended in all tourist destinations:\n\n* Watch your bag or purse in public, e.g. buses, trains and meetings. Keep your car locked with valuables out of view and do not leave your valuables like cameras, jewellery or mobile phones on the beach when you go for a swim.\n* If your mobile phone is stolen, the local cell phone company may help you to track it and in most cases telephones could be found if resold anywhere in Abkhazia.\n* Don't hesitate to report crimes to the local police. If you report a theft, people are generally helpful.\n\n==Stay healthy==\n\nBoil or sterilize '''tap water''' before drinking.\n\n==Respect==\nAbkhazia is a traditional and conservative country, so dress modestly. Clothing which exposes too much skin will give you a bad image from the local people, and you will thereby get unwelcome attention and less respect.\n\nFor very obvious reasons, '''avoid praising or talking about Georgia (country)|Georgia'''. Since the end of the Soviet Union, feelings of hostility, anger, and bitterness towards Georgia and Georgian people are common. Abkhazians feel it is unfair that their country has been denied international recognition. \n\nDon't say that you're in Georgia (country)|Georgia when visiting Abkhazia.\n\n==Connect==\n\nThere are some Internet cafes in all major resort cities: Sukhumi, Gagra, Gudauta.\n\n===Post===\nIt is possible to send post from Abkhazia abroad via Russia. However, the main post office in Sukhum (Aiaaira st. 108) burned down in January 2012, and hasn't been rebuilt (Aug 2018). Reportedly, the post office is temporarily located in the Sukhum telephone exchange (Jul 2017). Other towns with post offices are (Jul 2017) Gagra (Ardzinba st. 147), Gudauta (Heroes ave. 3), Gulrypsh (Constitution st. 4), Ochamchira (Shinkuba st. 62), Gal (Leon st. 3), Tkuarchal (Adyghe st. 4), New Athos (Kharazia st. 2). Otherwise, the nearest post office for international mail is in Adler, Russia. Abkhazian post offices also usually allow making international telephone calls at costs of about  per minute.\n\n===Telephones===\nLandline phone numbers have the format of &lt;code&gt;+7 840 XXX-XX-XX&lt;/code&gt;.\n\nThere are 2 local mobile operators [http://www.a-mobile.biz/ A-Mobile] and [http://www.aquafon.com/ Aquafon], the latest one being the largest and having bigger coverage. Their mobile numbers follow the next format &lt;code&gt;+7 940 XXX-XX-XX&lt;/code&gt;. A SIM card costs about , incl.  credit, and there are special rates for travelers, no ID is required for card purchase and almost all available tariff plans are prepaid ones. Both operators offer 4G which is available almost in all towns. Foreign SIM cards usually do not work with the exception of Russian branded operators MTS, Beeline, Megafon.\n\nIt is common for telephone numbers not to be recognised, and therefore it is worth redialing many times.\n\n==Go next==\n* Georgia (country)|Georgia with its beautiful and mysterious mountain region of Svaneti in Northwestern Georgia close by (if you are allowed through the border).\n* Russia — The border with Russia is now open for all visitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They are filled with larger numbers of bas-reliefs and artwork that display everyday life, including war, sacrifices and torture methods.

Here you will find a number of tour operators authorized by IBAMA to sail to the archipelago. The cost per person for a day-trip is around R$220 (about USD 140). Check the page for Caravelas for instructions on how to get to Caravelas.\n\nOnce in Caravelas, you can only get to Abrolhos by boat. Your choices are:\n\n* '''Fishing boat''' - If you go on a fishing boat it will take around 6 hours to get there. You will be forced on an overnight stay.\n* '''Catamarã''' - Takes around 3h30min and you have the choice to stay overnight.\n* '''Speed boat''' - Around 1h30min depending on sea conditions. It is a one-day trip.\n\n==Get around==\n\nOnly swimming or by boat. You cannot get anywhere on foot unless you're on the island, which you will not be for more than 30min. So be prepared to spend a lot of time in the sea or on the boat.\n\n==See==\n\n\n* \n\n==Do==\n\n* '''Plenty of swimming'''\n* If you dive, it is a great option (it costs around R$150 (about USD 70) for a 30-minute dive.\n* '''Whale watch'''\nIf you go to Abrolhos during the mating season (July to November), go on a whale-watching excursion. You would probably come across some on your way to Abrolhos, but it may be more interesting to go for a dedicated whale-watching tour.\n\n==Eat==\nYou cannot bring your own food unless you get permission from the boat's captain. The food is served on board by the tour operators authorized to sail to the island.\n\n==Drink==\n\n* Plenty of mineral water and soft drinks. Avoid alcohol as you will be at sea and alcohol can be dangerous, as people normally underestimate the dangers of the sea. You do not want to spoil your holidays...\n\n==Sleep==\n\n* If you plan to sleep in Abrolhos you should be aware it can only be done on board of a boat. Since they are small boats, they will rock and if you're prone to sea-sickness you should take some pills or avoid an overnight stay and return to the continent in the afternoon.\n\n==Go next==\n\n\n"

                    "text": "\n\n'''Abruzzo''' is one of the twenty Italian regions. It is situated in the central part of Italy, to the east of Rome on the Adriatic Sea. Abruzzo's western border lies less than 50 miles due east of Rome. Abruzzo borders the region of Marche to the north, Lazio to the west and south-west, Molise to the south-east, and the Adriatic Sea to the east. Although geographically more of a central than southern region, ISTAT (the Italian statistical authority) considers it part of Southern Italy, a vestige of Abruzzo's historic association with the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.\n\nAbruzzo is known as the greenest region in Europe as almost half of its territory, the largest in Europe, is set aside as national parks and protected nature reserves. Its territory is composed of rolling hills and fertile plains at the base of the Apennine mountains, featuring wild beaches and ancient towns perched on hilltops. It is also home to Calderone, Europe's southernmost glacier. A vacation in Abruzzo offers a taste of the unspoiled Italy.\n\n==Provinces==\n\n\nAbruzzo is divided into four provinces:\n\nThe four provinces feature 305 municipalities: L'Aquila comprises 108, Chieti 104, Pescara 46, Teramo 47.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==Cities==\n\n*  — The regional capital of Abruzzo, with an imposing 16th century castle, the ''Fontana delle 99 Cannelle'' and the pink and white marble Basilica di Santa Maria di Collemaggio with its Holy Door and Gothic interior.\n* —\n* —\n* — the largest city, with 6.5 miles of seaside promenade with wide sandy beaches\n* — a medieval town famous for its sugared almonds, the 11th-century cathedral of San Panfilo, and the 13th-century church of San Francesco delle Scarpe\n* — between the highest mountains of the Apennines\n* —\n* —\n\n==Other destinations==\n===Nature===\nImage: Gran sasso italia.jpg|thumb|Corno Grande seen from Campo Imperatore's plateau\nOut of the three geographical areas (Marsica, Appennino and Sub-Appennino), one third of the region is designated either as national or regional park areas.\n\nThis region, where the north of Italy meets the south, is also one of the most beautiful in the country. Bordered by the Apennines to the west and fringed by the Adriatic on the east, it has some of Italy's most unspoiled scenery. In the Gran Sasso it has the highest mountain of the Apennine range. Stand atop the Gran Sasso and you have views of both the Adriatic and the Tyrrhenian (Mediterranean) Seas across the entire width of Italy. You could journey through the Abruzzo's valleys for days, never encountering another person, and when you travel up to the broad mountain plains of the Abruzzi, you'll meet the eerie sight of entire abandoned hill towns. Plan your holiday in Abruzzo with plenty of time to walk, drive and explore.\n\nIn the past decade, Abruzzo has increased in tourism tremendously, along with other Italian Destinations. Castles and Medieval towns are very popular tourist attractions near the town of L'Aquila. Abruzzo is also known for its skiing because they have 21 attractions only hours from Rome. The ski resort mountain heights can compare to the Alpines. However, Abruzzo is known for cross country skiing.\nAbruzzo is picturesque in its scenery. Many old villages were abandoned and remain largely intact, and the country side is rich with historic sites. It is often said that Abruzzo has as many castles as it does sheep. Most of this sleepy region has remained as it was in medieval times making Abruzzo the first stop for those seeking to take a glance at the past or a chance to see nature as it was hundreds of years ago, unspoiled and perfect.\n\nIf you do not like to ski, Abruzzo offers an abundance of beaches as well. Abruzzo's 129 km sandy coastline is home to many popular beach resorts, among them Vasto, on the southern coast; , whose sands are considered among the best in Italy, , Francavilla al Mare and Pineto on the mid-coast, and on Abruzzo's northern coast Alba Adriatica and Martinsicuro.\n\n*  (''Parco Nazionale del Gran Sasso e dei Monti della Laga'')\n*  (''Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise'')\n*  (''Parco Nazionale della Majella'')\n*  (''Parco Naturale Regionale Sirente-Velino'')\n\nThe Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, an impressive national park founded in 1922, is host to every variety plant and animal imaginable and considered the most important park in Italy. No other park in Italy is better developed for camping and recreational activities. Great stands of beech, oak, and birch can be found in the park along with beautiful wild flowers of every color and design. The brown bears of the region along with wolves, eagles, and large wild cats find refuge in the park, making Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo a haven for vanishing species.\n\n==Understand==\nImage: SMariaCollemaggio.jpg|thumb|The façade of Santa Maria di Collemaggio, L'Aquila\nIn the Middle Ages the region began to be called Abruzzo, from the Latin ''Aprutium''. Then the region was divided into two parts: Further Abruzzo and Hither Abruzzo. In 1860, with the Unity of Italy, the region of Molise was added to Abruzzo and they were called Abruzzi and Molise. In 1963 Abruzzo and Molise became separate entities once more.\n\nThough Italians once thought  of Abruzzo as a remote region separated from Rome by the Apennines, a modern expressway system has opened the region to tourism.  Most of Abruzzo lies within a few hours of Rome and is  convenient for day trips from the capital as well as Naples.  Abruzzo's more populous east is made up of vast sandy beaches that stretch along the Adriatic; its west of hills that rise quickly to mountains.  The mountainous region of l'Aquila, which lies nearest Rome,  contains castles, ancient ruins and spectacular mountain vistas.\n\nAbruzzo's main city and administrative town, L'Aquila, is a beautiful city in a picturesque mountain setting which makes it a great destination start for exploring the region. Pescara is pleasantly modern and offers all the features to be found in a city on the Adriatic: business, shops, entertainment. Chieti is full of history and nicely layered along the hill on which it is situated. Teramo is interesting and lively. Smaller charming town such as Sulmona and Scanno should also not be missed.\n\nThe region is 65% mountain 34% hills and the remainder flat land. The region has four provinces and each have a distinct climate. The province of L'Aquila is totally characterized by mountains, in the Chieti area it is rolling hills, while in Pescara and Teramo the areas are covered by a mixture of mountains and hill.\n\t\n===Tourist information ===\n* [https://abruzzoturismo.it/en/ Abruzzo tourism] website\n\n==Get in==\nImage: Pescara aeroporto.jpg|thumb|Abruzzo International Airport in Pescara\n===By plane===\n[http://www.abruzzoairport.com/ Abruzzo International Airport] () in Pescara is served by low cost airlines with low fare flights from and to Brussels, Bucharest, Copenhagen, Frankfurt, Krakow, London, Manchester, Milan and Turin.\n\n===By train===\nAbruzzo can be reached by train from Tiburtina railway station in Rome, a journey which offers truly picturesque views of the valleys in the Apennines and of some charming hill towns in Italy.\n\n===By car===\nThere are three autostrade (toll motorways) that connect Abruzzo to the rest of Italy:\n*'''A14''' — ''Adriatic Motorway'', links Bologna to Taranto through the main coastal towns of the region\n*'''A24''' — ''Parks Motorway'', links Rome to Teramo via L'Aquila\n*'''A25''' — links Rome to Pescara crossing the region from west to east\n\nPrivate and public transport by car or bus from and to Rome are therefore excellent.\n\n==Get around==\nImage: Stazione di Pescara 01.jpg|thumb|Pescara Centrale Railway Station\nTrains and buses run regularly from Rome and through Pescara and L'Aquila, these journeys through the mountains can be spectacular and highly recommended. From there, most towns can be reached by local buses. See [http://www.trenitalia.com Trenitalia] and [http://www.arpaonline.it/ ARPA] for more details.\n\nIf you intend to travel from Rome to Abruzzo, the station you will catch your Express or Stopping coach will be from Staz. Tiburtina.  Expect to pay about  return for an Abruzzo destination.\nThe coast can be explored by train or bus, since all comforts of modern travelling are available.\nThere is a bus network which connects all four major cities: Pescara, L'Aquila, Chieti, Teramo.\nIn order to visit rural areas, a car is recommended if you want to reach relatively unknown villages in remote locations of Abruzzo.\n\nFor a detailed map: [https://www.viamichelin.it/web/Mappe-Piantine?address=abruzzo]\n\n==See==\nImage: Amiternum.jpg|thumb|The roman amphitheater of Amiternum, L'Aquila\nThe Abruzzo region is a remote region often overlooked by tourists. It has spectacular natural scenery, medieval castles and villages, monasteries, and Roman ruins. Two-thirds of the Abruzzo's land is mountainous with the rest being hills and coast. A third of the region is designated as national or regional parkland. Bordering regions are Marche to the north, Lazio to the west, Molise to the south, and the Adriatic Sea to the east.\n\nMuch of the Abruzzo region is in national or regional parks. Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo is a large protected area with good hiking and biking trails. Its seven visitor centers have trail maps and information. Guided tours can be arranged in Pescasseroli. Gran Sasso, the highest point in the Apennine Mountains, has hiking trails, spring wildflowers, and winter skiing.\n\nPescara, on the Adriatic coast, is the largest city in the Abruzzo region. Although it was badly bombed during the war, it's now a good example of a modern Italian city and still retains some historic elements. Pescara has a nice seaside promenade, 20 km of sandy beach, great seafood restaurants, and lots of nightlife. The Museum of the Abruzzi People has a huge collection of artifacts about life in the Abruzzo from prehistoric times through the 19th century. Pescara has a few other museums and several good churches and buildings, too. In July, Pescara holds an international jazz festival.\n\n==Do==\nImage: Lungomare giulianova.jpg|thumb|The promenade of Giulianova\nImage: Snow - Parco Nazionale del Gran Sasso.jpg|thumb|Snowboarding in Gran Sasso National Park\n*'''Beaches''' — Abruzzo's 129 km long sandy coastline (interrupted in places by pebble beaches) is home to many popular beach resorts.  Beaches worth visiting are in Fossacesia and Vasto Marina, on Abruzzo's southern coast; Silvi Marina, Francavilla al Mare and Pineto, further north; finally, travelling north, shortly before Le Marche, Alba Adriatica and Martinsicuro close the list of seaside resorts which are considered among the best in Italy. Beaches of Abruzzo are pristine and the waters of the Adriatic are warm. Lifeguards are operative full-time on most Italian beaches, during the summer season. It is best to follow posted warning signs and status flags describing the sea's condition on the day you decide to take a swim. Most beaches have corded off bathing areas - pass these at your own risk, as the waters deepen significantly very quickly.\n*'''Hiking, horseback riding, mountain climbing and sightseeing''' — Abruzzo's extensive park system  lies within two hours of Rome or less and includes natural beauty akin to national parks in the western United States.  Within Abruzzo's parks lie some of Italy's most beautiful ancient hill towns rivaling those of Tuscany and Umbria.\n*'''Skiing''' — Abruzzo has 15 ski resorts with 368 km of runs in 172 different ski tracks, all within a couple of hours drive from Rome. The most popular resorts are Roccaraso, Campo Felice, Campo Imperatore. Located on the highest altitudes of the Apennines, these ski areas are at heights nearly comparable to many resorts in the Alps.  Because of their proximity to the Adriatic and winter precipitation patterns, they often have more snow than the Alps. Abruzzo also is popular for cross country skiing, especially on the high plain of Campo Imperatore in the Gran Sasso as well as the Piana Grande in the Majella.\n*'''Museums''' — In L'Aquila, you can visit the National Museum of Abruzzi, with sections for paleontology, archaeology and medieval art (painting, sculpture, jewelry, ceramics, lace, sacred ornaments, glass windows). Pescara has the Museum of the Folk Traditions of Abruzzo, which holds a didactic archaeological exhibition. The Pinacoteca Civica in Teramo displays beautiful majolica. Chieti's National Museum of Antiquities houses important relics of the ancient Italics, Greeks and Romans, including some remarkable pieces such as the Warrior of Capestrano, of the fourth century B.C.\n*'''Rock Climbing''' — Abruzzo offers a great destination for rock climbing, beach combing, and mountain biking.  Amazing rock climbing areas are: Petrellia Liri, Roccamorice, San Vito, Assergi, Monticchio, Capestrano, Fara Sam Martino.\n*'''Zoo''' — Near the little village of Civitella Casanova is a nice zoo: Parco Zoo La Rupe. It's built on a mountain with a beautiful view and it features many animal species.\n\n==Eat==\nimage:Scamorza.jpg|250px|thumb|''Scamorza affumicata''\nimage:Burrata2.jpg|250px|thumb|A ball of ''burrata''\nIn Italy, high consideration for food (and wine) quality and variety is a reason of pride. Regional cooking is a unique experience for the foreign visitor: in Abruzzo this is no exception. Here are some of the local specialities that you may enjoy:\nAbruzzo's food is based on peasant dishes. Lamb is very popular inland and the Abruzzo produces pecorino (lamb's milk) and goat's milk cheeses. Pork is also used frequently and on the coast there are many fish dishes. Baked scamorza cheese is a common dish that can be a main course or appetizer. Saffron is used frequently.\n*''Spaghetti alla chitarra'' (square strands of pasta served with a tomato sauce)\n*''Fagioli e cotiche di maiale'' (stewed beans and pork rind)\n*''Prosciutto di cinghiale'' (wild boar ham)\n*''Testicoli di mulo'' (small round lean pork sausages; though the name seems anatomical, they are named that way as they are always sold in pairs)\n*''Pecorino d'Abruzzo'' (local sheep's cheese)\n*''Burrata'' (a truly rare delicacy – a ball of tangy cheese with a soft buttery center)\n*''Salame di fegato pazzo'' (spiced liver salami)\n*''Salame di fegato dolce'' (liver salami made with honey)\n*''Arrosticini'' (the most famous regional dish, lamb or sheep meat cut into chunks and pierced by a skewer)\n*''Ventricina'' (a spicy salami with chili pepper and fennel)\n\n==Drink==\n*''Montepulciano d'Abruzzo'' (a red wine)\n*''Trebbiano d'Abruzzo'' (a white wine)\n*''Rosatello aquilano'' (a rosé wine)\n*''Corfinio della Valle Peligna'' (a light white wine)\n*''Amaro Gran Sasso'' (one of the bitter digestive liqueurs that Italians are so fond of.

                    "text": "\n\n\n\n'''Abu Dhabi''' (Arabic: أَبُو ظَبِي) is the federal capital and the seat of the three branches of government of the United Arab Emirates. It is the largest city and capital of the Abu Dhabi (emirate)|Emirate of Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe city is a collection of islands connected together and features colossal monuments, elegant museums, green boulevards, high-rise buildings, international luxury hotel chains and opulent shopping malls.\n==Understand==\n===History===\nAbu Dhabi is the capital and seat of the government of the United Arab Emirates, hence it is the go-to destination for any major political event or ministerial headquarters.  It is ''not'', however, the commercial or tourism capital of the country &amp;mdash; that would be Dubai &amp;mdash; but massive investment in aviation and tourism since the 2000s has definitely added a lot things to do in city.\n\nThe city was not intended to be the capital of the UAE. The capital of the UAE was supposed to be a planned city between Abu Dhabi and Dubai and was to be called 'Al Karama' (which means dignity in Arabic) as stated in the first version of the constitution. However, considering the earlier stage of the union was a volatile time, with multiple issues and various ordeals occurring, Abu Dhabi was made the temporary capital as it was the home of the UAE founding father Sheikh Zayed. Later, Abu Dhabi was declared to be the permanent capital of the UAE by the agreement of the rest of the seven UAE founding fathers. The capital and the seat of the three branches of the government were to be in the Abu Dhabi Capital District, while the rest of the city would continue to be a city catered to the native population and residents. Abu Dhabi is also the headquarters of the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces, with an enormous walled city outside of Abu Dhabi called Sheikh Zayed Military City hosting the defensive headquarters of the military. As a result, it is a common sight to see Emiratis in military fatigue around the city.\n\n===People===\n\n\nMany international companies, diplomatic outposts, and embassies are based in Abu Dhabi. The city has a population of approximately 1.87 million residents (2016), of which 294,000 are UAE nationals accounting for 15.7% of the city's population. In a bid to attract foreign investors and urban planners, the city followed in Dubai's footsteps by forming economic free zones, loosened Islamic laws, and increased real estate sales to foreigners. As the diplomatic center of the federal government, the city hosts various monuments and museums. The most recognizable icon is the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque which is a common visiting site for tourists and diplomats. The mosque allows non-Muslims to enter and explore the Islamic architecture of the mosque. Various monuments honoring Emirati achievements also exist, including the Oasis of Dignity (called Wahat Al Karama locally). The large monument faces the mosque and has the names of fallen Emirati soldiers inscribed in the memorial.\n\n===Diplomacy===\nIn order to build the international status of the city as a diplomacy center, the UAE government formed very close relationship with other governments; most recognizably France and the United States. As a result, a lot of American-based companies and personnel are based in the city. The American embassy is the largest embassy in Abu Dhabi and almost recognizable as a landmark with its triangular design, as well as Abu Dhabi airport is one of the few airports hosting a US pre-clearance facility; the facility allows travelers to the US to clear immigration and customs at the airport, and arrive to the US as domestic travelers.\n\nThe official language of Abu Dhabi and the rest of the UAE is Arabic, but English is the ''de facto lingua franca'', and almost everyone speaks it. Emiratis are a minority in Abu Dhabi, and most of the population is comprised of foreigners; most retail workers and service staff are from India or the Philippines and do not speak Arabic. All signs are bilingual in Arabic and English and the city's atmosphere is very friendly to visitors. Occasionally, foreign head of states visit Abu Dhabi, so seeing roads lined with flags of various countries is a common sight. Seeing F-16 fighter jets flying over the skies of Abu Dhabi is also a common sight, as a major UAE-US airbase (Al Dhafrah airbase) is near the city and sometimes jets escort foreign dignitaries traveling to the UAE. The city's vibe changes depending on which foreign head of state visits it. The city was decorated with Chinese flags and the red color when the Chinese president visited, while the city was garnished with yellow and white when Pope Francis visited. The UAE flag is almost always everywhere, decorated with the red-white-black-green colors decorating the streets, buildings, tunnels, and skyscrapers.\n\n\n\n===Entertainment===\nThe city has also been expanding its entertainment industry vastly, creating massive projects such as Formula 1 track, the Ferrari World theme park, and Warner Bros. World Abu Dhabi. There are several museums, such as the Louvre Abu Dhabi, Guggenheim museum (under construction), and the UAE's national museum - Zayed Museum (under construction).\n\nThe city is also a frequent host of Judo competitions by the International Judo Federation, Formula One races, and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) championships. The city also hosts the finals of the UAE football Pro-League as well as Asian Federation Cup games in Sheikh Zayed Sports Stadium.\n\n=== Climate ===\n\n\nThe city has an arid climate, with very hot temperatures in the summer; this time of year is usually spent indoors with air conditioning, especially between the morning and late afternoon. The weather is pleasant between mid-fall and early spring, which is a great time for outdoor dining and activities. Annual precipitation totals .\n\n===Orientation===\n\n*[https://visitabudhabi.ae/en Visit Abu Dhabi] tourist information.\n\nMost of Abu Dhabi is on a wedged-shaped island that lies from northwest to southeast, connected by three bridges to the mainland, and other bridges to other islands, most of which also eventually connect to the mainland. The main island features many 'superblocks' with wide, multi-lane roads dividing them and buses running routes along them. The other islands include:\n\n* Mariyah, which is home to the Abu Dhabi Global Market and Galleria Mall, as well as the Rosewood Hotel and Four Seasons Hotel.\n* Reem, which is largely residential but features two malls - Reem Mall and Shams Boutik. \n* Hudayriyat, which features pristine beaches and nature reserves.\n* Saadiyat, which is home to cultural and educational institutions as well as some beach clubs\n* Yas Island|Yas, which features the theme parks and many hospitality venues.\n\nStreet addresses in Abu Dhabi are simultaneously very logical and hopelessly confusing. Many major roads have traditional names which don't often correspond to the official names (e.g. Airport Rd and Rashid bin Saeed St). The city is divided into districts like Al Khalidiyya, and has recently named all main and side streets with numbered addresses (e.g. 107 Hamouda Bin Ali Al Dhaheri St for Galleria Mall). The system of main streets is straight forward after getting used to, but side street names are not often used day-to-day. The system, when used, is convenient since you can enter the address and navigate using Google Maps, this is especially useful for residential addresses, which unlike most businesses and hotels, are not listed as on Google Maps. As the system is new, adoption is still in progress, and you might get requests from delivery drivers asking for your location on WhatsApp to reach you. Most locals and long-time residents opt to ignore the system entirely and navigate using landmarks; if taking a taxi, odds are you will get to \"behind the Hilton Baynunah\" much faster than \"Fifth Street, Sector 2\". In any case, Google Maps is very widely used and you can reach almost any destination using it. Using ride-share apps (e.g. Careem) or even telling the name where you want to go to a taxi driver will let them immediately know where exactly you want to be dropped.\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By plane===\n*  | url=https://www.zayedinternationalairport.ae/en/ | email=\n| address= | lat=24.433056 | long=54.651111 | directions=\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\n| hours= | price=\n| wikipedia=Zayed International Airport | image=AbuDhabiIntlAirport.JPG | wikidata=Q643562\n|lastedit=2024-02-14| content=The UAE's second busiest airport (after Dubai) and the home base of Abu Dhabi's flag carrier [http://www.etihadairways.com/ Etihad Airways] with flights to Australia, Europe and the United States.\n}}\n\nA viable alternative is to fly to DXB|Dubai International Airport () in the neighbouring emirate of Dubai and continue onward to Abu Dhabi by bus or by taxi.\n\nIn combination with SHJ|Sharjah International Airport () just northwest of Dubai, all three airports in combination of two might allow for a cheap connection from Europe to Asia when self-organising transfer between the different airports.\n\nSee the specific airports for details on how to connect between them.\n\n===By road===\n\n\nThe five-laned E11 highway between Dubai and Abu Dhabi is the country's heaviest-traveled route, and the 130-km journey can be covered in about 1 hour and 20 minutes. There is a national speed limit of 120 km/h. This speed is wildly exceeded by some drivers. Stay out of the leftmost lane and drive carefully, especially at night. E11 is the longest highway in the Emirates.\n\nIf you rent a [https://limousinedubai.ae/ Limousine] in Abu Dhabi, chances are that the car will warn you if go above 120 km/h. Depending on the vehicle, it might just be a flashing light or an accompanying, continuous, shrill beep. If you get annoyed by this, you might not want to exceed 120 km/h.\n\nTo travel directly into Abu Dhabi from Dubai on E11,  keep to your left at Al Shahama and follow the E10 highway, which passes Yas Island (exit at the E12 highway) and Al Raha Beach on the way to the Sheikh Zayed Bridge into Abu Dhabi.  This bridge connects directly to Salam Street (8th Street), a wide megahighway along the northern shore of Abu Dhabi Island.  As an alternative to the Zayed Bridge, there are ramps off E10 that connect to the Maqta Bridge, which leads to 2nd Street (Airport Road) and to 4th Street (East Road or Muroor Road).  During off-peak periods, these routes run fairly quickly into the city.\n\n====Parking====\n\nParking within the city is monitored by ''Mawaqif'', which also supply the parking meters. Parking meters have displays in English and Arabic. ''Darb'' is an app used for parking and tolls and is available on Android and iOS.\n\nFinding a parking in main island of Abu Dhabi is a disaster. Parking spaces are extremely limited and most are parking designated for specific institutions. You are more likely to save time if you Uber or take a taxi to your destination instead of driving as finding a parking can take you hours. If you end up finding a parking, you'll have to walk a long way to reach your destination. Most people who own cars but live in mainland Abu Dhabi deliberately use taxis to get around due to the parking shortage. On the brighter side, shopping malls usually have free of charge underground parking with lots of parking spaces. Some close to door parking spaces are designated for electric or hybrid cars only as an incentive to drive electric cars.\n\nParking areas in Abu Dhabi are clearly marked; yellow and grey for no parking, blue and black for standard fare, and blue and white for premium fare.\n\n===By bus===\nYou can get into Abu Dhabi from the other Emirates of Dubai, Sharjah, etc., by bus. The ''Emirates Express'' between Abu Dhabi and Dubai is operated jointly by the Abu Dhabi and Dubai municipalities. The 130-km route takes around two hours. The buses operated by Dubai's RTA are luxury buses. There are also the Abu Dhabi transport buses. The first bus departs from the  on the corner of Hazza bin Zayed the First (11th) St and East (4th) Rd at 5:30AM and the last leaves at 11:30PM; they leave at 30-minute intervals, or if the bus gets full sooner. From Dubai, the buses leave from 5:30AM, and run until 11:30PM, from the Al Ghubaiba station in Bur Dubai (opposite Carrefour Shopping). For bus times, see the [http://www.rta.ae/wpsv5/links/buses/timetable/E102Both.pdf timetable] published on the Government of Dubai's website.\n\nIf you hold an Emirates flight ticket and arrive to or depart from Dubai airport, the airline offers a complimentary extension of your trip to/from Abu Dhabi. Buses depart from Dubai airport Terminal 3 and arrive to Emirates Abu Dhabi office located in Al Sawari Tower. [http://www.emirates.com/english/plan_book/to_and_from_airport/free_shuttle_service_dubai.aspx Contact Emirates customer service for booking].\n\n===By taxi===\nTaxis are widely available everywhere. You can flag down any metered taxi on the street in Dubai or any other place in the UAE and ask to go to Abu Dhabi. Ride-share applications such as Uber and Careem are also available. An official taxi can be booked through the Abu Dhabi Taxi app.\n\n==Get around==\n\n\n\nAbu Dhabi offers buses and plenty of taxis to get around. Since the most of the city is located in Abu Dhabi island, traffic is a common occurrence.\n\n===By taxi===\nTaxis are a good way to get around if you don't have a car. Abu Dhabi's taxis are relatively cheap. The main taxis are silver with yellow signs on the top. Flag fall costs 5 dirham, 5.50 dirham at night (10PM to 6AM) (2017) and the minimum fare is 12 dirham. You can flag one down from anywhere in Abu Dhabi. Alternatively, you can book a taxi in Abu Dhabi by calling 600535353 or by using the Abu Dhabi Taxi app, for a 4-dirham booking fee. Taxis will charge you 1.82 dirham per kilometer (2.93 dirham per mile), and 50 fils for every minute of waiting.\n\nTaxis are monitored using GPS and are not allowed to give above certain speeds. These change depending on where the taxi is.\n\nNewer-looking black cabs also go around town sometimes. These are airport taxis, which you can get on at Abu Dhabi airport and get off anywhere in the city for 60-100 dirham. You can recognise them with their coloured signs on the top, displaying text in English and Arabic.\n\nYou are not expected to tip taxi drivers, but gratuity will be extremely appreciated.\n\n===By bus===\nThe main bus station in Abu Dhabi is near Hazaa Bin Zayed Road, adjacent to Al Wahdah Mall and Al Nahyan Stadium. You can get buses here going to the different points within the city as well as inter-city buses. The bus stand also serves as a taxi stand, for inter-emirate taxis.  The inter-city buses and airport buses are easy to locate at the bus terminal, and well signposted.  The route services depart from various stops in the vicinity, and not all enter the bus terminal proper.  There is no directional signage or and no maps.\n\n'''''Hafilat'' card.''' Tickets can only be loaded on disposable or reusable smart cards. No cash is accepted by the drivers. The dark bluish green buses are air-conditioned but not wheelchair accessible. Passengers can board and alight at the designated stops along the route. These locations can be identified by the temporary Department of Transport bus stop poles or using the Darbi app. Bus stops that do not have the DoT bus stop sign may not be served as not all bus stops along the route are used.\n\n''Hafilat'' smart cards can be purchased from ticket machines which can be found at the main bus station, outside the Abu Dhabi Mall area and the airport. Machines are unremarkable and hard to spot, thus ask locals. Alternatively, cards can be purchased from some supermarkets including Lulu, Abu Dhabi Cooperative Society and SPAR. The smallest amount you can put on the card is dirham. Each bus ride costs 2 dirham plus 0.05 (regular bus) or 0.10 dirham (express bus) per kilometer, so in practice, you need to have at least 2 dirham on the card when you get on the bus. The maximum fare for a single rider on a single trip is now 5 dirham as of December 2023. You have to punch in and punch out of each bus ride, so that the correct distance will be charged.\n\n* '''Route 5:''' Al Meena to Marina Mall via Abu Dhabi Mall and Hamden Street.

The buses are modern and air-conditioned. The services are as punctual as possible and operate more or less around the clock. The front few seats are reserved for women, men and families should move towards the back of the bus.\n\n===By car===\nIf you do decide to take the plunge and rent a car, beware that the street numbering system is unusual, and it can take weeks to get used to it. U-turns are allowed at almost every intersection from the left-most lane. When the left lane signal turns green, you simply have to swing a U-turn and come back. Whatever other flaws drivers here may have, they do ''not'' run red lights. There are cameras at many intersections, fines are high, and residents who are not citizens can be deported for reckless driving or running too many red lights. When the light starts flashing, that taxi in front of you ''will'' jam on the brakes, and you should, too. When the light turns green, however, expect someone behind you to honk at you immediately to get you moving. Almost all roads are monitored by remote radars, and you will get a hefty fine by mail for violating the speed limit without anyone stopping you or telling you you've been driving fast. The speed limit on speed signs is exactly the limit on which the radar will catch you. (There is no margin If you exceed the limit as in Dubai and other emirates, you will be fined if you exceed the written sign limit.)\n\nOutside Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi license plates have a reputation for reckless drivers due to the large sized traffic lanes in Abu Dhabi, causing Abu Dhabi drivers to drive poorly when they move to smaller lanes in other emirates. Tempered drivers are common. They can pull out in front of you, change lanes at random, and text while driving. On the other hand, the ban on drunk driving is very strictly enforced.\n\nThe E11 Abu Dhabi to Dubai road is considered the most dangerous road in the UAE. Large number of people travel back and forth between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and a large number of them don't always pay attention on the road. The road broke the record for the largest traffic accident in UAE history. Its not uncommon to see drivers reading newspapers, or watching a movie across this segment of highway. Despite excellent roads, and a traffic signal system, vehicle accidents remain the largest cause of deaths in the UAE.\n\n===On foot===\nWhile walking in Abu Dhabi is not a problem for locals, tourists from colder climates will suffer from the heat and sun. The temperatures can exceed 45°C in the summer.\n\nWhile staying inside or using a vehicle is a good idea, if you have to walk, try to do it night, when it is cooler. Plus, you won't get sunburnt. If you have to go during the day, wear plenty of SPF 50 sunblock, wear a hat and light clothing and try to keep in the shade as much as possible.\n\n=== By bicycle ===\n\nThere is a separated cycleway that runs almost the entire length of the Corniche, as well as around Yas Island, and other parts of Abu Dhabi.\n\n[https://www.careem.com/en-AE/bike/ Careem Bike] operates an electrically assisted shared bike system. The stations are mostly located near the waterfront.\n\n==See==\n\nAbu Dhabi offers a lot of historical and cultural sights but it certainly isn't lacking in modern attractions.\n* \n\n* \n* \n\n* \n* \n* \n* , including  of galleries.\n}}\n* \n* \n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* '''Religious buildings''' are in abundance in Abu Dhabi. There are mosques made out of a variety of materials and in several styles, such as the sandstone Ali Bin Ghanim Bin Hamouda near the Gold Souk, or futuristic Al Aziz Mosque on Reem Island. There is also a cluster of churches and mosques for different denominations adjacent to Umm Al Emarat Park. The Swaminarayan temple of the Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha is a large and impressive Hindu Mandir between Abu Dhabi and Dubai opening on 14 February 2024. \n* '''Abu Dhabi History Museum and Aquarium''' ''(Khalifa Park)'' 3PM-11PM''.'' Not to be confused with the Abu Dhabi Natural History Museum or The National Aquarium, this child-friendly museum features a 'dark ride' featuring animatronic Emiratis explaining the history and formation of the UAE from the nomadic era to the modern day. After the cart deposits you at the end of the ride, there is a small aquarium to see. Khalifa Park also features a train, horses and a mock heritage village. 7 dirham.\n* '''Port Mina Zayed'''. The 'Port Mina' district features excellent spots to view adjacent islands as well as passing cruise and container ships but is also a paradise for shoppers. Several blocks are dedicated to air conditioned outdoor 'souks'. These are the Fruit and Vegetables, Dates, Iranian, Flower, Rug, Pet and Fish Markets. There are several large gift shops in the vicinity of these markets. The Souq Al Mina is a modern complex near one of the ports and its restaurants feature excellent kombucha, pizza or a Balkan grill. The 421 Arts Campus is a warehouse repurposed as an arts space and it is also located in the Port area. Occasional exhibitions. \n===Parks===\nAbu Dhabi has several large green spaces, many of which include play areas and equipment for children, and the city is studded with lovely fountains, swathes of neon light, and the occasional sculpture.\n*\n* \n\n===Cultural events===\n* \n* \n* \n\n===Upcoming projects===\nThere are a vast number of projects coming up in Abu Dhabi.\n* \n* \n\n==Do==\n\n* Swimming at the public beaches of  and  .\n* '''Private beaches''': Nearly all hotels and private clubs in Abu Dhabi offer swimming facilities, usually in the form of private beaches. You can pay for a day's use, or for a year's. Another, notably cheaper, option is The club, an organization geared towards expatriates.\n* \n* '''Cricket:''' [https://booking.sportshub.abudhabi Zayed Cricket Stadium], capacity 20,000, is in Khalifa City east of the centre. \n\n* \n*  \n* \n* '''Yas Island''' hosts attractions such as the F1 racing circuit and four theme parks: Ferrari World, Warner Bros. World, SeaWorld and Waterworld. When there are no events, the F1 circuit is used for cycling and exercise and bikes can be hired onsite.\n* '''Kayaking''' or '''eco boating''' are possible through the Eastern Mangroves or Jubail Mangrove Park. There are several rental companies available in the vicinity of each. To find the kayak hire companies, head to Anantara Eastern Mangroves, walk past the hotel and down the promenade.\n* '''Exercise''' in the desert at the city's many running or cycle tracks such as at Al Wathba.\n\n==Buy==\nAbu Dhabi is a compulsive shopper's dream. There are several malls, most of which have the same stores as other malls. Besides establishments aimed at locals, malls also include popular foreign chain stores, as well as designer places. Many visitors will be surprised at the female fashion dichotomy - while local custom calls for women to be covered in public, most stores sell short skirts and halter tops alongside the more sedate floor-length skirts and high-necked shirts.\n\n* \n\n* \n* \n* \n*\n* \n* \n* '''Hamdan Centre''' ''(in the city centre on Hamdan Bin Mohammed St - Al Danah)'' M-Su 8AM-11PM. The oldest mall in Abu Dhabi, Hamdan Centre is a little dated but quite charming and an excellent spot for bargaining, gift shops, shoes and leather goods. \n* '''Gold Souk''' (''Madinat Zayed Mall).'' Su-Th 9AM-10PM, Fr 4PM-10PM. A great place to get gold, jewelry, perfume and gifts. The adjacent mall is well known for its textiles.\n\n\n\nThere are also many small, independent stores around the city. On the bottom floor of one building, a person can purchase fancy chocolates, computer parts, antiques and clothing. It is better to purchase things such as carpets, art, native jewellery and antiques at the independent or souk-like places than at the malls, as the price will be lower and the shopkeepers more willing to haggle.\n\nBargaining is a big part of shopping in the Emirates, but be prudent. If prices are not marked, or a shopkeeper does not tell you the price is fixed, it will typically be up for negotiation. Don't bargain at Marks and Spencer or Hang Ten. Save your discounting skills for independent shops dealing in antiques and the like.\n\nShopping in most places can be frustrating, as the assistants will follow you around the store. This is partly due to their concept of what constitutes good service, and partly because there is a shoplifting problem. Most will not be intrusive, but some employees can be very pushy and overly obsequious. Smile and thank them often, and you're more likely to be left alone after a bit.\n\nIn carpet stores - or anywhere that sells tapestries, Indian antiques, and the like don't feel too pressured to buy, and don't be shocked if they start unrolling beautiful rug after beautiful rug at your feet. You are under no obligation to buy, no matter how much time they spend with you. However, the pressure will be very steady, and shyer shoppers may want to travel in packs for comfort's sake.\n\nGrocery stores such as Spinney's, Carrefour and the Abu Dhabi Cooperative Society are inexpensive and usually stocked with Western goods. Examine all products before purchasing. Visitors wishing to purchase pork products will likely have to enter a separate room to do so, typically labelled 'Non Muslim', as nationals are not permitted in these sections of the grocery stores.\n\nPrices in Abu Dhabi tend to be very competitive. The UAE has a Value Added Tax of 5% on most products aside from basic food items. Prices displayed must be the price at the till - be wary if a shopkeeper claims an item is a given price, then adjusts the price to 'include' VAT.\n\nGeneral discount seasons are midyear and at the end of the year. There will typically be sales around public holidays and Summer.  These are the time where you can get some branded items with a very low price, maybe last season's stock.\n\n==Eat==\n\n\n\nMost food is certified halal but some hotels are allowed to serve pork dishes.\n\nIndian food is relatively cheap, Levantine food is widely available and there are a few Chinese restaurants with reasonable prices. Hotel restaurants are typically the most expensive. The city is home to all manner of fast food franchises like McDonald's and Hardees, usually located at malls.\n\nThe fun thing about Abu Dhabi is that most kitchens, from tiny falafel kiosks to grand hotel restaurants to Burger King, deliver anywhere in the city. Delivery is quick, reliable, and free at some restaurants. Delivery can be arranged via Whatsapp or apps like Talabat or Deliveroo.\n\nVegetarians will find the city's selection of meals very satisfying. Vegetable and bean-heavy native dishes, the array of splendid pure vegetarian Indian cuisine, and the ready availability of fresh salads make eating in Abu Dhabi a stress-free experience. Strict vegans may have a little difficulty communicating their precise demands, but most places offer vegan dishes and are always willing to accommodate a paying customer. The best choice for pure vegans is one of many Indian vegetarian restaurants like Evergreen, Sangeetha in the Tourist Club area.\n\nCheck the Islamic calendar to determine whether you will be visiting during the month of Ramadan. Since Muslims fast during daylight hours, some restaurants may be closed during the day. Customers are allowed to eat and drink in restaurants, cafes and food courts during fasting hours, but it is otherwise offensive to locals and officially against the law to eat, drink (including water), or smoke in public during fasting hours; this law was rarely enforced, and there are no recent reports of enforcement. Large hotels generally have one restaurant open during the day to serve meals to non-Muslims. During the evening, however, it's quite a different story, as the festive atmosphere of ''iftar'' (breaking the fast) begins and residents gather for lavish, Thanksgiving-like meals; most hotels and some restaurants offer ''iftar'' buffets, which are often busy and need to be booked in advance. As long as you don't mind tiding yourself over in private, the evening meals are magnificent.\n\n* \n\n===Budget===\n\nSome of the cheapest food in the city can be found in many Indian restaurants. Portions are almost always generous, prices low, and quality excellent. Set meals of rice, fish curry, lentil curry (''dhal''), peppery soup (''rasam''), a vegetable side dish and perhaps a small fried fish, served on a large steel tray (''thali'') with little steel bowls for the accompaniments. The Keralite version of a ''thali'' is called a ''sadya'' and is usually served on weekends. \n\nCafeterias are ubiquitous. They will typically serve chai of some sort, instant coffee, juices and food like club sandwiches or 'Zinker' burgers. What they lack in atmosphere and decor they will make up with their deep fryers and affordability. Shawarmas and other wraps are also common across the city, and affordable. Abu Dhabi also has several Afghan bakeries that use gas-fired ovens and tandoors to produce flatbreads and wraps.\n\n====Near the Corniche Beach====\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n====Around the Abu Dhabi Mall====\n\n*\n* \n* '''Abil Fida''' (''Near the Strand Hotel''). Hearty and affordable Lebanese grill restaurant.\n\n====Near the Umm Al Emarat Park====\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n====In the E10 district====\n\nThere are several budget-friendly restaurants in this area.\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n====In the E9-02 district====\n\n*\n\n===Mid-range===\n\n* Saudi Kitchen, Opposite Mushrif Mall. Traditional Gulf food, served in a traditional Gulf style - with each group seated on the floor and sharing their dishes. \n\n=== Splurge ===\nAbu Dhabi's pricier restaurants tend to be located in the higher-end hotels like the Rosewood on Al Maryah, Anantara Eastern Mangroves, or Jumeirah at Saadiyat Island. \n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n==Drink==\n\n\nOnly restaurants in hotels were allowed to serve alcohol. Therefore, nightlife is typically associated with hotels. The legal minimum drinking age is 21 and bringing your own alcohol is not allowed in restaurants. Unlike some other Middle Eastern nations, the bars in Abu Dhabi will be able to accommodate most drink orders. Many licensed premises feature '''Brunch''', which does not refer to a meal between breakfast and lunch but an all inclusive package, typically consisting of a few hours of food (sometimes a buffet), drinks and potentially entertainment.\n\nThere are many bottle shops around the city. A liquor license used to be required for residents to purchase alcohol to take off-premises, but this is no longer the case. Drinking in public outside of licensed premises remains illegal.\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* '''Heroes Never Die'''. This pub is at the basement of the Millennium Downtown. Run by the same company as Stars n Bars, this is a fun sports bar which often features a live band or DJ, as well as pool tables. Named after the eponymous and since-closed Heroes which was at the basement of the Crowne Hotel.\n* '''Craft by Side Hustle''' ''(in Galleria Mall)'' is the first gastropub/brewery in the Gulf. \n* '''Easy Tiger''' ''(in Al Ain Palace Hotel)'' is a divey bar with different attractions available each night such as a pub quiz ran by two Irish former teachers on Friday nights.\n* '''Nalukettu Restaurant''' ''(in Al Ain Palace Hotel)'' is a restaurant/bar selling good Keralan food with a reasonable drinks menu. \n* \n* \n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n==Sleep==\n\n\n\nHotels are well-tended and host first class restaurants, pools and other high-end facilities.\n\n===Mid-range===\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n===Splurge===\n\n\n\n*\n* \n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n==Stay safe==\nAbu Dhabi was ranked as the safest city in the world 3 years in a row by 2019 by the largest crowd-sourced global database Numbeo. The city is extremely safe, however it never hurts to practice common sense. Some people may try to scam you through telephone messages or automated voice calls telling you that you won the lottery, that you're in a legal trouble for violating a law, or that a Sheikh has decided to give you free money, or something of that sort.\n\nTaxi drivers are monitored and they're very safe. Rarely, crime does occur but is quickly dealt with by the federal police as the city is the headquarters of the Ministry of Interior. Law enforcement officers, police patrols, and police horse units are a common sight in the city.\n\nAlcohol can only be consumed privately or in licensed public places. Drunk driving is a serious offence and getting caught may result in deportation.\n\n==Cope==\n\n===Embassies===\nBeing the national capital, Abu Dhabi hosts a large number of embassies. A majority of them are clustered in the Embassies District (Al Safarat) south of the Al Bateen Executive Airport and in the adjacent Al Ma'ared Area, west of Rabdan St and south of Shk Rashid bin Saeed Rd (Road #18); and the adjacent Capital Centre south of Al Karamah St surrounding the Exhibition Centre. There are others further northwest in Al Danah, Al Markaziyah and in other parts of the city as well.

Its long coastline, the shallow waters of the Southern Gulf, extending from the base of the Qatar Peninsula in the west to the border of the emirate of Dubai on the north east, was once the world's best waters for pearling. When the pearling industry declined, oil discovery in the offshore oilfields of the Southern Gulf revived the economy of Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi was also the first emirate to export oil from the Umm Shaif offshore field in 1962. On the land, it stretches south to the oases of Liwa where some of the world's largest sand dunes can be found and east to the ancient oasis of Al Ain. This makes Abu Dhabi the largest as well as the most populated of all the emirates.\n\n==Get in==\nAbu Dhabi International Airport|Abu Dhabi () and Al Ain () have international airports, although Abu Dhabi's is by far the larger and better-connected of the two.

The Al Ain Oasis is the biggest in the region, and is made up of thousands of date palms.\n\nAt the Camel Souq about 5 km south of Al Ain, hundreds of camels are brought together to buy and sell.\n\nThe desert surrounding the border of Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia (the Empty Quarter) is an excellent spot for stargazing. Al Quaa is known as 'the milky way spot' and is the location of the Emirates Astronomical Observatory. \n\nThe highway between Liwa Oasis and Abu Dhabi has a few interesting sights that can be visited within a day.

Because most Nigerian government agencies are now headquartered in Abuja and most other countries' embassies have been relocated from Lagos to Abuja, it is a surprisingly expensive city.\n\n==Understand==\n\nAbuja is very beautiful. One of few purpose-built cities in the world planned and built from scratch, it has an excellent road network, a beautiful rolling terrain and modern Nigerian architecture. However, power is often erratic.\n\nIt is part of the Federal Capital Territory and one of the six local area councils, formally known as the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC). It is surrounded by the other councils which include Kuje, Gwagwalada, Kwali, Bwari, and Abaji. Majority of government institutions headquarters and offices are located in Abuja, mostly in Garki and the Central Business District.\n\nThe National Assembly, which the legislative arms of the government, is located in Maitama.\n\nAbuja is one of the world's fastest-growing cities, and the exact population is uncertain. The capital territory had 3.5 million inhabitants as of 2016.\n\n==Districts==\n\n &lt;!-- Abuja Light Rail --&gt;\n\n| region1color=\n| region1items=\n| region1description=\n\n| region2name=\n| region2color=\n| region2items=\n| region2description=\n\n| region3name=\n| region3color=\n| region3items=\n| region3description=\n\n| region4name=\n| region4color=\n| region4items=includes both Wuse I and Wuse II Districts\n| region4description=\n\n| region5name=\n| region5color=\n| region5items=includes both Garki I and Garki II Districts\n| region5description=\n}}\n\n&lt;!--these mapshapes are a work in progress --SHB2000 (April 2022)--&gt;\n|wikidata=Q111664646|title=Asokoro}}\n|wikidata=Q111664738|title=Durumi}}\n|wikidata=Q111664848|title=Jahi}}\n|wikidata=Q59815530|title=Wuse}}\n&lt;!--CBD – |wikidata=Q111664865|title=Abuja/Central Business District}}\n|wikidata=Q59815528|title=Garki}}\n--&gt;\n*  – a rural area in Abuja municipal area council\n*  – a suburban district and major way in and out of the FCT\n*'''Abuja/Gwarinpa|Gwarinpa''' - the largest housing estate in Nigeria, a bit to the north-west of the centre of Abuja.\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By plane===\n*  | url=http://abuja.airport-authority.com/ | email=\n| address= | lat=9.006806 | long=7.263194 | directions=\n| phone= | tollfree=\n| hours= | price=\n| wikipedia=Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport | image=Abuja Airport Iwelumo-1.jpg | wikidata=Q525030\n| lastedit=2022-07-23\n| content=Several airlines offer international flights, notably, Lufthansa, KLM, British Airways, Emirates, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines. Many visitors arrive on connecting flights from Lagos.\n}}\n\nWhile the industry is being overhauled and aviation safety is being upgraded, only a few local airlines are reliable: AeroContractors, Arik Air, Air Peace, Rano Air, Max air and Dana Air. The quasi-government-owned Arik Air has frequent flights from many domestic locations. Air Peace, Rano Air, Max air and Dana Air are private airlines but operate quite a few routes into Abuja as well.\n\nThe airport is approximately 40 km away from the city center. From the airport, take the official Green Cab. Board the cab with only people you know. Uber operates here as well. The Abuja light rail system connects the airport with the city centre, but very few trains operate per day. Bolt (formerly Taxify) also operates extensively within the city and off rides to and fro the airport. There are also private shuttle services offered to customers in the city.\n\n===By bus===\n\nYou can travel to Abuja by bus from major cities like Lagos, Benin, Kano and Port Harcourt. Reliable services include: ABC Transport (with air conditioned luxurious bus rides), Ekene Dili Chukwu, Chisco Transport (CTN) and Young Shall Grow. The preferred bus service would be ABC transport. These are for purposes of moving from other parts of the country to Abuja. \n\nTake day trip buses from wherever you are coming from in the country because part of the interstate roads are not maintained and full of potholes. And also the issue of being attacked by robbers by night. If you're unfamiliar with the country, take a bus with an escort. Buses allow you to appreciate the terrain, the towns and cities and the subtle changes in these and culture as you drive towards the capital either from the South or the North. \n\nBus shuttles have been banned in the city. You may find few buses that ply the outskirts of the city. Motorcycles (popularly known as ''Okada)'' has been banned as well but can be found in the slums and lowly areas.\n\n=== By train ===\n\n[http://nrc.gov.ng/ '''Nigeria Railway Corporation'''] has completed an inter-city line between Abuja and Kaduna, where you can connect with the rest of the Nigerian rail system. Trains arrive and depart from  which is about 15 km west of the city centre. As of 2018, there are four daily departures in each direction. The train service offers three types of fares: Economy, First Class and Sleeper. The schedules and current fairs can be found on the Nigeria Railway Corporation website.\n\nThere is a light rail connection from the railway station to the centre.\n\n==Get around==\nCar or taxi is the main mode of getting around Abuja: public transport is limited. However, the Abuja Light Rail provides service mainly on the west side of the city, and provides connections between the city, rail station and the airport. \n\nAbuja has a few strict driving laws that are enforced by different bodies of the government. The prominent road traffic and driving control enforcement bodies include VIO, FRSC, the Police. Seat belts are required of the driver and front seat passenger. The vehicle can be impounded and not released until the fine is paid. It will be helpful to have your papers updated as to avoid getting into trouble. Drivers don't typically observe lanes within the city, and often attempt to squeeze in what might seem to be dangerously close to your vehicle. In some cases they may drive on the sidewalks. However these happen mostly where there are no law enforcement officers present. Observation of traffic laws and traffic lights by drivers is higher in the city than in any other part of the country. Occasionally, drivers from other parts of the country that are unfamiliar with the driving culture in the city try to beat traffic lights. If you're driving, keep an eye out for other motorists, especially at intersections, who may try to beat the traffic lights. Occasionally, traffic lights stop working during outages and road marshals are deployed to critical intersections.\n\n==See==\n\n\n\nAbuja is a beautiful city&lt;!--Who said it was a beautiful. It seems too bland--&gt;. The tourist attractions are:\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Do==\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Buy==\n\nThere is some interesting artwork all over Abuja.

There are, however, many good restaurants in Abuja that are worth the money. Of course, whether you live in Abuja or are just visiting, there are times when you are willing to pay a little extra for the simple fact that there are few to no alternatives.\n\n* \n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n===Mid-range===\n* \n* '''Shawarma Shop''', adjacent to Amigos Supermarket, Wuse II. ₦700 for shwarmas and they offer pizzas for somewhere from ₦1500.\n* '''Southern Fried Chicken'''.

Average US$20  for some mixed drinks, US$5-9 for a local beer. Buy beer from the Market and you will save a lot of money. The major hotels have bars and restaurants. Watch out for the call girls, if you ignore them, they get really offended. If you are not interested, just say so and have a short conversation, then they will leave you alone.\n\n*  \n*  \n*  \n* '''British Village''' requires a membership to enter and is popular during different sporting events, especially during soccer games and rugby.\n* '''Jake's Club''' is in Silverbird Galleria, Central Business District.\n\n==Sleep==\n\n===Budget===\n\n===Mid-range===\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Splurge===\nDecent hotels in Abuja tend to cost above US$200 per night.\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n==Stay safe==\nAbuja tends to be a sharp contrast against the background of the rest of Nigeria. While car hijackings and armed robbery are high in Lagos, and kidnapping of foreign oil workers is prevalent in the Niger delta, Abuja, in sharp contrast, is one of the safest metropolitan cities on the continent. However, as the economic situation degrades, the safety tends to degrade as well.\n\nGeneral security measures like elsewhere in the world should be observed. Like anywhere else in the world, it's always a good idea to have company when exploring unfamiliar places. If you're driving, observe simple measures like keeping your car door locked when parked to avoid opportunistic crime. Armed robbery at gun point is the most prevalent form of crime. A calm disposition and full cooperation with robbers is the best line of action in the unlikely event that you are the victim of a robbery. At night, avoid to walk and drive or shut your windows and don't stop at red lights.\n\nRobbers tend to become violent when victims try to pull tricks. Contact your embassy in Abuja and the police if you are robbed. Occasional pick pockets target mobile phones and wallets as well. Do not carry large amounts of cash. Usually, US$250 cash (or ₦400,000) would more than suffice for impulsive purchases and other daily costs.\n\nWhen moving in Abuja, as a foreign visitor, you are best advised to use the official Green Cabs. There's a remote chance that privately operated unofficial cabs could be traps. Cab fares would be around ₦1500 for trips within the city. Cab rides to the airport are significantly higher, about ₦10000. Negotiate a fare before you enter a cab.\n\nThere have been reports of fraudulent use of credit card details almost immediately after people have used their cards to pay hotel deposits, even in the very top hotels.\n\n==Connect==\n\n==Cope==\n===Embassies, Consulates and High Commissions===\n\n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n\n==Go next==\n* Jos\n* Kaduna\n* Lokoja\n* Minna\n\n\n\n"

                    "text": "\n\n\nImage:Egypt-region-map-cities.gif |thumb|315px|right| '''Abu Simbel''' looks across [[:Wikipedia:Lake Nasser|Lake Nasser (bottom center).]]\n\n'''Abu Simbel''' (''also spelled:'' ...Sinbil, ...Sembel; ''Arabic:'' أبو سمبل) in Upper Egypt was saved from the rising waters of Lake Nasser, growing behind the Aswan Dam, in a massive archaeological rescue plan sponsored by UNESCO World Heritage List|UNESCO in the 1960s. The complex of temples dedicated to the Pharaoh Ramsis II \"the Great\" remain an evocative and unforgettable destination.\n\n==Understand==\n\nAbu Simbel is a village lying 280 km south of Aswan and 40 km north of the Sudanese border. It is a very small settlement with very little to attract visitors other than its great temples for which it is famous. Few tourists linger for more than a few hours, although there are 5 hotels to attract visitors to stay the night.\n\nThe temples at Abu Simbel used to be located further down the hillside, facing the Nile in the same relative positions, but due to the rising waters of Lake Nasser, the original locations are underwater. In the 1960s, each temple was carefully sawed into numbered stone cubes, moved uphill, and reassembled before the water rose.\n\nThe Great Temple of Ramses II was reassembled fronting a fake mountain, built like a domed basketball court, where the stone cubes occupy a section under the dome; from outside, the fake mountain looks like solid rock.\n\nArchaeologists have concluded that the immense sizes of the statues in the Great Temple were intended to scare potential enemies approaching Egypt's southern region, as they travelled down the Nile from out of Africa.\n\n===Climate===\n\n\n: ''See also: Egypt#Climate''\n\nSummers are extremely hot at days, while winters are warm at days and mild at nights. Rainfall is almost non-existent. The best time to visit is from November till February.\n\nIn Abu Simbel, it feels at least '''10°C (or 20°F) colder''' than in Aswan due to lake Nasser and the wind coming from it. Thus, bring some warm cloths and scarf, and especially in winter wear something that can deal with around 5–10 °C and strong wind.\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By plane===\n*  | url= | email=\n| address= | lat=22.375833 | long=31.611667 | directions=\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\n| hours= | price=\n| wikipedia=Abu Simbel Airport | image=Abu Simbel Airport.JPG | wikidata=Q774216\n| content=[http://www.egyptair.com.eg EgyptAir] offers frequent flights to Abu Simbel from Aswan (up to four flights daily).\n}}\n\n===By bus===\nForeign travellers can get to Abu Simbel by coach or minibus (tour) from Aswan, travelling in convoys. There is at least one daily convoy each way, taking 3 hours. Seats can be arranged at your hotel or through the Aswan tourist office. The cost for a return trip is LE150-350, depending on the season and your negotiation skills. It seems there are not many companies offering this tour, so the only price difference will be due to varying hotel commission. Nevertheless, inquire at several hotels, like Kaylany, Marhaba and Tiba (LE185 as of Nov 2018). The trip price does not include entrance fees, but may include travel to additional sights in Aswan such as the High Dam or unfinished obelisk, but only if agreed before. Also make sure you have at least two hours (by agreement with the booking office) in Abu Simbel and refer to this tour agreement in case the driver is not willing to stick to this. They will not leave without you, promised! (Also because of security concerns and rules.) Be prepared to be asked for a tip by the driver at the end, even though he just cashed LE200 for this simple bus ride and the driver's behaviour was not really accommodating nor did he deliver any additional service like a stop at the high dam.\n\nSit on the left hand side of the bus, and you will see the sunrise in the morning (if awake) and be in the shade on the way back.\n\nThere are also two public buses from Aswan (3 hours each way). One leaves at 4AM and the second one at 11AM. All convoy buses need to leave for their return journey to Aswan by 4PM latest.\n\n===By car===\nAbu Simbel is generally not accessible to foreigners travelling by their own car, because of police security concerns. Travellers are only able to access Abu Simbel by bus from Aswan. Or they can rent a car with driver via a local agency, which is the most comfortable way.\n\nHowever, you might get around these concerns and travel with you own car or taxi by telling the police you are working in Egypt&amp;mdash;mostly they will not be able to identify that from your passport due to the lack of knowledge of the Roman letters. You would however prefer to travel with the car convoy all tourist mini-buses go with, starting at around 5AM from &amp;mdash;just take the road towards Abu Simbel and after having left Aswan you will encounter the checkpoint with waiting mini-buses and a more throughout police questioning.\n\n===By boat===\nIt is possible to travel by cruise ship from Aswan through Lake Nasser to Abu Simbel.\n\n==Get around==\n\nThe town of Abu Simbel is small enough to navigate on foot.\n\n==See==\n*\n* \n* \n\n==Do==\nRead more about the temples before arriving: time at Abu Simbel will likely be limited, with little time to read about the stone carvings inside the temples. Beyond the temples themselves, the detailed description of sawing and moving the stone cubes is also an interesting story to read.\n\nAs with the pyramids at Giza, reading about them, before arriving, in no way diminishes the impact of seeing them firsthand. The reconstructed temples at Abu Simbel appear entirely real, not like a simulated building at some theme parks; however, do go inside the dome of the Great Temple to appreciate that it is a fake mountain.\n\nEarly morning boat tours of Lake Nasser or to see the sunrise on the monuments can be arranged through Eskaleh Nubian Lodge.\n\n==Buy==\n\n==Eat==\nVisitors might need to bring their own snacks and beverages, due to the length of the journey and the limited time at Abu Simbel. There are many cafes along the main road. Prices are high due to the number of tourists.\n\n* \n* \n* \n==Drink==\n\n==Sleep==\n\nMany people do Abu Simbel as a day trip and fall asleep on the ride to/from Abu Simbel due to its early time. A reason to stay overnight is to see the Sound &amp; Light show or see the temples away from the crowds. Expect to pay more in Abu Simbel due to its isolated location than equivalent hotels in Cairo.\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Connect==\n\n==Go next==\n\n\n\n\n\n"

About 35&amp;nbsp;km south of the Egyptian capital Cairo, Abusir is the site of a compact pyramid field, with pyramids and funerary temples dating mainly from the 5th Dynasty of the Old Kingdom. It is somewhat \"off the beaten track\" for most visitors and therefore ideal for exploration with far less hassle and company than will be experienced at Giza, or even Saqqara.\n\n==Understand==\n\nJust one, relatively small segment of the extensive \"pyramid field\" that extends from north of Giza to below Saqqara, the locality of Abusir took its turn as the focus of the prestigious western burial rites operating out of the then-capital of Memphis (Egypt)|Memphis as an elite cemetery (or necropolis) during the Old Kingdom 5th Dynasty. Neighbouring Giza had by then \"filled up\" with the massive pyramids and other monuments of the 4th Dynasty, leading the 5th Dynasty pharaohs to seek sites elsewhere for their own funerary monuments. Although two 5th Dynasty pharaohs (Unas and Userkaf) did build their pyramids further south at Saqqara, adjacent to the 3rd Dynasty Step Pyramid of Djoser, most of the Dynasty's rulers concentrated their efforts at Abusir (for their pyramids and associated funerary temples) and elsewhere (for their so-called \"sun-temples\").\n\n==Get in==\n\nAbusir is not served by any viable means of public transport, the site lying some distance from the village and the main road that leads south to Saqqara. The only practible means of visiting Abusir are by car, by hired taxi (perhaps in association with a visit to Saqqara or Giza) or as part of an organised tour group.\n\nThere are local trains from central Cairo to El Hawamdeyya, a few kilometers to the east.\n\n* \n\n==See==\n\n\n\nThe '''Abusir necropolis''' is open daily 8am-4pm. Admission LE80 (as of Dec 2018). 14 pyramids were constructed at Abusir - of these, four were those of pharaohs, three of royal women and one unfinished.

                    "text": "\n\n\n'''Abydos''' is an important Ancient Egyptian archaeological site in Middle Egypt, a collection of temples, sites and ancient cemeteries close to the town of ''al-Balyana'', 90&amp;nbsp;km (56&amp;nbsp;miles) north of Luxor.\n\n==Understand==\nThe sacred city of Abydos (''Abdju'') is occupied since the Predynastic period; their rulers' town, temple and tombs, in the royal necropolis of Umm el-Qa'ab, have been found here.  \n\nA funerary chapel of Pepi I of the 6th Dynasty evolved over the years into the Great Temple of Osiris, and Abydos became the centre of the worship of the Isis and Osiris cult. The temple and town continued to be rebuilt at intervals down to the times of the 30th Dynasty, and the cemetery was in continuous use. The Great Temple and most of the ancient town are buried under the modern buildings, to the north of the Seti temple. Many of the original structures, and the artifacts within them, are considered irretrievable and lost, most likely destroyed by the new construction.\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By train===\n\nMost travellers arrive at Abydos by train north from Luxor, alighting at the station for the town of ''al-Balyana''. The fare is approximately Egypt#Money|LE 52, first class. From the station, either the tourist police or a police-escorted taxi will take you to the site of the Ramesside temples. Depending on local conditions and police levels of business, you should be able to get ''at least'' a couple of hours visiting the site.\n\nAt al-Balyana, there should be some police at the station. If not, ignore any touts, exit the station to the south and you will almost immediately come to the east-west road that heads out to Abydos. Start heading west along this road and you will soon come to the police checkpoint, they used to be where the road forms a bridge over the canal, and had a small blue wooden sentry box and some barriers. They will either take you to the main temple of Seti I, or arrange a taxi for you. It's usually a private taxi, but sometimes a share. As always, have small denomination notes to the pay the fare as drivers always have \"no change\". It's not necessary to spend money getting a private taxi to wait. When you leave the temple the police on site will find a vehicle for you to get back down to town, just so you aren't their problem anymore. \n\nBack at the station the police will usually (not always) wait with you and see you on the train. Note that if a 3rd class train comes first (as it often does late afternoon), they will often put you on that one. It's not the most clean or comfortable experience (no air con, no guaranteed seats, sometimes not even any lighting), but the travel time isn't much different to the nicer trains. All in all, the journey is more hassle than an organised tour, but the freedom you get to spend several hours on site and explore on your own, in peace and in your own time, makes it well worth while.\n\n===By road===\n\nYou can go by taxi in the police-escorted convoy to Abydos in one day, usually including Dendera as a stop-off point. A trip in a private car arranged through your hotels could cost around US$90 for two or three passengers (Oct 2018). You can likely get a better price by talking to taxi drivers directly. Make sure you agree on how much time you will spend at each temple - 90 min each is a minimum, though if you want to spend longer (especially at Abydos), then taking the train and just doing Abydos will give you much more time on site, and will work out much cheaper, though dealing with the local police is a hassle. \n\nAlso available are minibus tours from agents in Luxor, usually with a local guide of variable quality. These also travel with the escorted convoy, and can be a reasonable deal for a small group if you haggle, especially in off-season. Expect to pay around LE 300 - 400 per person, dependent on size of your group, time of year and your haggling skills. The major UK, US and European holiday companies also offer escorted tours, but these can be expensive.\n\n==Get around==\n\n\n==See==\n\n*  \n** \n* \n* \n\n==Do==\n\n==Buy==\n\n==Eat and sleep==\nThe square facing the temple features several cafés.\n\n* \n* \n\n==Go next==\n*Luxor\n*Dendera\n\n\n\n\n"

It is on the UNESCO World Heritage List and has been featured in many films, mostly as a stand-in for Jerusalem. It has appeared in more than 10 films, including ''Lawrence of Arabia'' and ''Gladiator''.\n\nOvernighting in Aït Benhaddou is recommendable as you get to see the Ksar in different lighting conditions. It looks very different in the morning when sun rises or when the sun is just setting.\n\n==Get in==\nAït Benhaddou is accessible from Ouarzazate and Marrakesh.\n\n===By bus===\nMost buses do not go directly to Aït Benhaddou but can drop you off at the turn off about 7 km away from where you will have to find a lift. Or, you can get dropped off a little earlier at Tadoula, from where you can walk through the desert for about 5 km.\n\n===By taxi===\nA grand taxi seat from Ouarzazate costs 20 dirham (as of 2023). From or to the junction at the highway, it is 10 dirham.\n\nOr, you arrange a private hire of a taxi for the trip. During the daytime, grand taxis are always waiting at the crossing.\n\nFrom Marrakesh it will be a full day trip and thus a private tour might not be a bad idea. \n\n===By car===\nAït Benhaddou is 9 km off the main Tizi n Tichka road, which links Ouarzazate to Marrakech. Coming from Ouarzazate, turn to the right after about 18 km from the town. It's quite a scenic drive to Aït Benhaddou. On the way into town there is a slight turn to the right, which is a popular spot for great views over the town and the Kasbah.\n\n==Get around==\n\nOnce inside the Ksar you can only walk or climb. There are two main entrances into the Ksar. One can be reached by new bridge. To reach the second, it is necessary to cross the river using the stepping stones (in dry season the river is completely dry).\n\n==See==\nThe town itself is the main attraction, with mud buildings climbing up the side of the hill.\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Do==\n* Climb to the top the hill for breathtaking views.\n* Rent a bike and drive up the road to Telouet (~50 km).

A group of rebel Taino natives attacked and drowned a Spanish conquistador named SALCEDO, thus debunking the myth that the Spanish were gods.

                    "text": "\n'''Acadiana''' is a region of Louisiana, in the south and south west of the state. It is sometimes called \"Cajun Country\", noted for its distinctive culture. This is the birthplace of Cajun cuisine, Cajun music, and Zydeco music.\n\n== Regions ==\n\nFrom west to east, Acadiana can be broken into five distinct and unique regions, where Cajun and Creole peoples adapted unique aspects from their environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==Cities==\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n*  – largest city\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Other destinations==\n* \n*  (also known as ''Atchafalaya Swamp'') - enormous swamp around the Atchafalaya River\n\n==Understand==\n\nAcadiana or Cajun Country spreads over the prairies and bayous of SW Louisiana. Acadiana is a reference to the large population of Acadians, descendants of French speakers expelled from Nova Scotia by the British. These Louisiana Acadians are known as Cajuns, an English corruption of ''Acadiens''.\n\nWhile the Cajuns are the dominant population, since early in its history the region has also included Native Americans, Germans, Spanish, French Creoles, and Creoles of Color, all of whom made their contribution to creating Acadiana. Many more people have contributed more recently to the vibrant region with its unique culture, dialects, and food.\n\nWhile locals were long proud of their traditions, in the early 20th century Cajuns were often looked down on. A fortunate change came about in the last third of the 20th century, when a new widespread appreciation of Cajun culture developed, especially for its music and food.\n\nRoman Catholicism is the majority religion in Acadiana, which makes it stand out together with Greater New Orleans in contrast to the rest of the largely Evangelical Protestant South.\n\n==Talk==\n\nAcadiana is home to the majority of Louisiana's Francophones. The vast majority of people in Acadiana can speak English, though some older ''Cadiens'' in rural areas may speak only French phrasebook|French. Many Cajuns are bilingual, and around 30% of Acadiana residents can speak French (as opposed to 7% in Louisiana as a whole). Visitors from other English- or French-speaking regions may struggle with stronger local accents. The local English accent incorporates many basic French words and unique pronunciations.\n\nThe dialect of French spoken by the Francophones of Acadiana is essentially similar to the one spoken in New Brunswick and other Acadian areas of Canada. Communication in French between Cajuns and residents of France or Quebec usually requires some effort.\n\n==Get in==\nThe main airport in Acadiana is located in Lafayette (Louisiana)|Lafayette (), which serves flights to Houston, Dallas and Atlanta. Lake Charles () is the only other airport in the region with commercial air service, with flights to Houston and Dallas. Other towns have small airports that are only served by general aviation. Alternatively, you can fly into New Orleans () and drive into the region. If you are in New Orleans, there are tour buses and limo services that can bring you to the area.\n\n==Get around==\nIf you want to travel at your own pace, you should bring your own vehicle or rental car.  Tour bus companies are great, but you sign up for a specific itinerary.\n\n==See==\nIn the River Parishes along the Mississippi River, between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, is a historic region known locally as the Louisiana River Region. Historical plantation homes dating back to the 1800s are on both banks of the river.  Some of these are open to the public, ranging from non-profit educational facilities to commercial tourist attractions with major amenities.  Pre-Civil War, there were hundreds of wealthy plantations along this trail, growing mostly sugar cane.  Most are gone today, but locals have worked diligently to keep the remaining plantations viable and open to the public for visiting.\n\n==Do==\nListen – and dance to – some Cajun and Zydeco music.  There are dance halls and clubs in cities and towns, and some scattered in more remote locations people drive for miles to get to.   A few of the more noted ones are:\n\n* Fred's Lounge, Mamou\n* Prejeans, just north of Lafayette\n* Randol's, Lafayette\n* Slim's Y-Ki-Ki, Opelousas\n* Whiskey River Landing, Henderson, near Breaux Bridge\n\nAcadiana hosts a number of festivals. Some major ones are:\n\n* Crawfish Festival, May in Breaux Bridge\n* Festivals Acadiens et Créoles, September or October in Lafayette\n* Festival International de Louisiane in late April, Lafayette\n* Frog Festival, November in Rayne\n* Zydeco Festival, August in Opelousas\n\nSwamp life:\n* \n\n==Eat==\n\nReal Cajun food! Acadiana is the birthplace of Cajun food.  Much of what is labeled \"Cajun\" elsewhere (including other parts of Louisiana!) has little to do with the delicious real thing.\n\nNot to be confused with the Creole style of cooking native to New Orleans, Cajun food is more provincial and less glamorous than its counterpart to the east. Equally rich to Creole food, Cajun dishes are often spicier as well. Cajun food also does not rely on tomato sauce to the same degree as Creole food, and in foods common in both cuisines, the Cajun version is often a brown color compared to the Creole's red version. Some of the more notable Cajun food that visitors should sample in Acadiana are:\n\n* '''Boudin''':  (pronounced \"Boo Dan\") A spicy sausage that descends from the 'boudin blanc' of French cuisine, it consists of a sausage casing filled with a mixture of rice, pork, liver, green onion, and other bits. First-timers should be sure to inquire as to the level of spiciness, since some varieties can pack a lot of heat. Boudin filling can also be rolled into balls, breaded, and then deep fried to create boudin balls. Ask a local where to get the best boudin, they are often fiercely loyal to that of their favorite butcher shop or restaurant. While pork is usual, crawfish or shrimp boudin is sometimes seen.\n* '''Cracklin':''' The Cajun version of pork rinds, they are often heartier and much spicier than other varieties. Most trips to get boudin aren't complete without an accompanying small grease-soaked brown bag of cracklins for the trip home.\n* '''Crawfish:''' Whatever you do, don't call them \"crayfish.\" Crawfish are a local delicacy to Louisiana, and in particular for Acadiana. The neighboring town of Breaux Bridge proclaims itself the \"Crawfish Capital of the World,\" and residents of the region eagerly await the return of crawfish season every year. Crawfish is served in a variety of ways in Cajun cooking. Étouffée is a dish consisting of the meat of the crustacean smothered in butter, onions, peppers, and spices, and finally served over white rice. Fried crawfish is also another popular option. Perhaps the most popular method of cooking is a crawfish boil, which like the clam bakes of more northernly destinations, is part meal, part communal celebration. Large quantities of live crawfish are boiled in heavily-seasoned water, along with potatoes, corn, and onions (also meant to be eaten later). The finished product is then often poured out on a large table for everyone to grab a seat and dig in. Locals have different techniques for peeling the hard shells, and they are eager to teach any newcomer their particular method. Some say the \"fat\" sucked out of the head is the best part, but I'll leave that up to you to decide.\n* '''Gumbo:''' While gumbo can be sampled in New Orleans and other destinations, residents of Acadiana often insist their regional version of the thick stew-like dish is the true version. Some noticeable differences include darker roux and the lack of tomatoes (which are seen in New Orleans gumbo due to the history of Italian immigration in the city). Two main varieties of Cajun gumbo include seafood (often with shrimp, crab, oysters, and sometimes crawfish) and chicken and andouille sausage (a slightly different version with duck replacing the chicken is lesser known but equally delicious).\n* '''Jambalaya:''' An easy way to think of this oddly-named dish is basically Cajun paella. It always consists of rice, vegetables, spices, and some kind of meat, but never tomato sauce unlike Creole jambalaya. Types of meat often include chicken, sausage, shrimp, or tasso (a smoked, cured, and spiced cut of pork).\n* '''Rice &amp; gravy:''' A staple crop of South Louisiana (the town of Crowley calls itself the \"Rice Capital of the World\"), rice is more important to Cajun cooking than probably any other European-derived American cuisine. It is served with étouffée and gumbo, mixed with spices and liver to make \"dirty rice,\"and paired with red beans and sausage for a famous Louisiana dish. In the case of rice and gravy, the white rice (most often long grain), serves as a starch addition to braised or smothered meat with gravy. Most often made with pork cutlets, the gravy is made with meat drippings, onions, peppers, and spices. Rice-based dishes trace their roots to a time when the Cajun people of Louisiana often needed to stretch what little meat and vegetables they had into a full meal. Today rice and gravy dishes are more of a comfort food, but they can be bought as \"plate lunches\" as various small eateries and even the corner grocery store or deli.\n\nIn addition to these several true Cajun dishes, there are many other items which are unique to Acadiana and can be found, at least in an authentic form, no where else in the world, as well as beloved Southern dishes such as fried chicken and frog legs.\n\n==Drink==\nMany enjoy a cold beer with Cajun food or music. Lafayette's Parish Brewing Company concentrates on quality small batch brews, including the popular Canebrake wheat beer brewed with local sugarcane.  The Bayou Teche Beer company in Arnaudville sells multiple varieties brewed at the Mississippi brewery Lazy Magnolia.   Also popular in Acadiana is Abita Beer, from Abita Springs in Acadiana's neighbor to the east, the Florida Parishes. As in all of Louisiana, whiskey is also popular.\n\nWhile famous for its drive-through daiquiri shops, Louisiana does have an open container law - please wait until you've reached your destination to crack open that frozen deliciousness.  When you tour a plantation, depending on the plantation's own rules, visitors over age 21 may purchase an alcoholic beverage and drink it while taking a tour, walking the grounds, etc.  This is also true for some swamp tours and golf outings.\n\n==Stay safe==\n\n==Go next==\n* Greater New Orleans\n* Florida Parishes\n* Texas\n\n\n\n\n\n"

                    "text": "\n\n\n'''Acadia National Park''' is the only United States national parks|United States national park in New England and the easternmost national park on the mainland.  It is on the coast of the Down East region of Maine, near the town of Bar Harbor. \n\n==Understand==\n\nAcadia NP encompasses more than , 30,300 of which are on Mount Desert Island.  2,728 acres of the park lie on Isle au Haut and 2,266 more on the Winter Harbor|Schoodic Peninsula in Winter Harbor.\n\nAcadia is one of the smaller national parks in the country, yet it attracts around 4 million visitors per year. \n===History===\n\nIt was designated as '''Sieur de Monts National Monument''' in 1916 by a presidential proclamation by Woodrow Wilson. Congress renamed the park '''Lafayette National Park''' in 1919.  Congress again enacted a name change in 1929 to the name we now use, '''Acadia National Park'''.  It was the first NP established east of the Mississippi River.\n\nIn October 1947, Acadia and some adjacent lands were ravaged by fire.\n\n===Landscape===\nA quick look at any topographical map of Mount Desert Island will indicate the powerful and lasting effects of the last ice age on the island and the current landscape of '''Acadia'''.  As the last glacier receded over 18,000 years ago it left behind the elongated mountains and lakes we see today.  The moving ice was also the culprit behind the \"bald\" summits of most of the park's hilltops, scraping off vegetation and leaving the beautiful pink granite underneath.\n\n===Flora and fauna===\n\nMore than 273 bird species have been identified in the park, including bald eagles, peregrine falcons, blue jays, finches, and chickadees (the Maine state bird).  Mammal species include deer, squirrels, foxes, rabbits, porcupines and bats.  Other species include garter snakes, the American bullfrog, and the North American red-bellied salamander.\n\n===Climate===\n &amp;#160;&amp;#160; Data from [http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/normals NOAA (1981-2010)]\n}}\n\nAcadia's weather is largely a product of latitude and marine influences. On a daily and annual basis, Mount Desert Island temperatures are more moderate than those of inland Maine. The Maine coastal climate has been ranked second only to the Pacific Northwest in annual precipitation. This moisture occurs in every form at Acadia. Ice storms are regular in winter and early spring, and rain is frequent in every month. Fog is common during June, July, and August.\n\n'''Spring''' can be foggy with temperatures ranging between  and . Wear light-colored clothing, long sleeve shirts, and long pants for protection. Annual rainfall is .\n\n'''Summer''' daytime temperatures range from  to . Evenings are cooler. Dressing in layers is advisable for any boating or hiking activities. Ocean water temperatures range from  to . Lake water temperatures range from  to .\n\n'''Fall''' temperatures can range from low 70s during the day to freezing during the night. Come prepared for all types of weather, from sun to fog, from downpours to flurries. Fall foliage often peaks during the first couple of weeks in October. Weather conditions over the summer, such as drought, may alter the time that the leaves peak.\n\nIn the '''winter''', due to Acadia's coastal location, snow and weather conditions change rapidly. Temperatures vary from mid-30s to below zero. The park averages  of snow annually.

There are bicycle racks on the front and back of each bus if you'd like to combine transport methods as you explore. Island Explorer buses are propane-powered.\n\n==See==\n* \n*\n* \n\n==Do==\n\n===Land activities===\n\nThere is an extensive network of carriage roads throughout Acadia National Park, which are closed to automobiles and are excellent places to '''ride your bicycle'''.  The carriage roads are mostly paved with crushed stone and, therefore, are best navigated on a mountain or hybrid bicycle.  Another option for cyclists is the ~20 mile (32 km) long Park Loop Road, which encircles much of the eastern portion of the park.  The road is open to automobiles, but is a one-way, two-lane road for much of its length.  The Park Loop Road appears to have been re-paved in 2008, making for a very smooth, pleasant ride.  Bikes can be rented in Bar Harbor.\n\nAcadia has the best '''day hiking''' in the Eastern U.S.  Walking the [http://www.nps.gov/acad/planyourvisit/hiking.htm miles of trails] is one of the best ways to experience the park.  Immerse yourself in the flora and fauna of the island on a number of different hikes of various environment, length, and difficulty. These trails are stunning, with high ocean views, accessible tree lines, steep precipices, stone bridges, etc.\n\nAcadia is a great place to '''birdwatching|birdwatch''', with many species calling the park home including bald eagles, peregrine falcons, great blue herons, cranes, ducks, geese, chickadees, woodpeckers, owls, orioles and blue jays can be seen in the park.  For an extensive checklist and more info on birdwatching opportunities in Acadia, see the [https://www.nps.gov/acad/planyourvisit/birdwatching.htm NPS's birdwatching page].\n\nThe park is one of the darkest spots on the East Coast and on a clear night '''stargazers''' can see the Milky Way in all of its glory. Drive into the park after dark, find a safe place to stop along one of the park roads or parking lots where you're not crowded in by trees or lights, get out and look up. You will not be disappointed.\n\n===Water activities===\n\nThe last glacier of 18,000 years ago carved out the incredible and beautiful terrain of the park, leaving behind some of the cleanest lakes and ponds in the country.  '''Sea kayaking''' tours and boat rental services are offered from numerous establishments in Bar Harbor and allow access to Mount Desert Island and other destinations.\n\n'''Fishing''' is allowed in the park in accordance with the [http://www.nps.gov/acad/planyourvisit/fishing.htm park regulations].  While ocean fishing is open to all, fishing in freshwater lakes and ponds requires a Maine state fishing license.  Licenses are required for residents aged 16 and up and non-residents 12 and up, and can be purchased at town offices and a few local shops.\n\nSome ponds and lakes are used for drinking water and do not allow swimming; check park office for list of approved swimming locations.\n\n*\n*\n\n===Tours===\n\nThose who prefer a guided experience can choose between free park tours or commercial options.\n\n* \n* \n\n==Buy==\n\n==Eat==\n* \n\n==Drink==\n\n==Sleep==\n\n===Lodging===\n\nThere are no hotels within the park borders, but the nearby town of Bar Harbor has numerous options.\n\n===Camping===\n\nThe park has three campgrounds:\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n===Backcountry===\n\nBackcountry camping is not permitted (and strongly discouraged due to the fragile ecosystem) in Acadia National Park.\n\n==Stay safe==\n*It is unsafe to venture out onto '''Maine's coastal waters''' without having the necessary equipment and experience.  This is true of kayaking, canoeing, sailing or any other kind of boating.  The water is cold and hypothermia can set in in a short amount of time.  Dense fog often rolls in very quickly as well as the occasional storm.\n\nIf you are determined to go out on your own, it would be foolish and could result in serious fines from the Coast Guard or a Marine Patrol officer to do so without ''every single passenger:'' \n*wearing a PFD '''and/or''' \n*having a compass and knowing how to use it '''and/or''' \n*understanding how to navigate safely around other boats and water hazards\n\nThere are numerous companies on Mount Desert Island and elsewhere that offer guided sea kayak, sailing, and power boat tours.\n\n==Go next==\n\n\n\n\n"

The English retaliated with mass deportations, known as ''le grand dérangement de 1755''. Some Acadians settled as far afield as Louisiana, some returned to France.

You should not have to pay more than M$50 per cab ride within the Costera area but fares can reach as much as M$120 for rides from La Costera to La Quebrada, Princess Hotel (Revolcadero Beach) and the airport. Alternatively most hotels can arrange for taxi transportation for a fixed fare (usually inflated). Prices will usually be about 50% more expensive than for a taxi hailed on the street.\n\nThere are several public transportation options: Yellow cabs are M$12 per person; buses are M$8 for non-air-conditioned, M$9.50 for air-conditioned, and M$10 (after buying a card for M$10) for AcaBus, a new system started in January 2017. Because of the sheer amount of taxis here, when one is dining out it is often worthwhile for them to offer a round trip and simply wait around while you have your meal, and they will not charge extra.\n\n'''Buses''' are worth experiencing even if you don't want to travel on them. Destinations are printed on the front window of each bus. There is no need to be at one of the regular bus stops in order to get on, except for AcaBus. Just wave your arm or look at the driver. He will stop and encourage you to get in. In fact, drivers will stop and try to get you to ride with them if you are even walking in the same direction that they are driving in. The bus system in Acapulco has been fully privatised; each bus is privately owned. This means they can decorate them however they want. Pink buses cruise around blaring out traditional Mexican music, racing against ones decked out in UV lights pulsing out club music into the night air. The complete lack of suspension makes for an unforgettable ride.\n\n'''Private autos:''' It is generally unwise to try to drive yourself around Acapulco. Traffic is heavy and drivers aggressive, parking is scarce, streets do not run in a neat grid, and even change names unexpectedly. Most, if not all streets lack signs indicating their name. In addition, foreign tourists driving rental cars can become targets of the Acapulco police officers, who will accept payment (~M$400) for violations in person at the time of pullover, without providing a receipt or proof of violation or clearing of the violation.\n\n==See==\n\n\n* \n* &lt;!--\n--&gt;\n* \n*  northwest of Acapulco, bordered on one side by the Pacific Ocean and on the other by a freshwater lake (Laguna de Cuyoca) on the other. The lagoon is extremely tranquil, but tourists are advised not to enter the Pacific Ocean at Pie de la Cuesta, because the surf is very dangerous. One can reach Pie de la Cuesta via bus. If you are on the Bay Side along the Costera, between Escudero and Diego Mendoza, look for the bus that says Pie de la Cuesta PLAYA LUCES. These go up that narrow strip of land. You can also take one that says San Isidro and that will let you off in the Zócalo in Pie de la Cuesta, but you have to walk a couple blocks to the strip and about a half kilometer up to the lagoon.\n}}\n* \n* \n\n===Beaches===\nMost beaches are in the bay area fronting the main boulevard \"La Costera\". This bay area is what made Acapulco famous and its beauty and majesty have not faded over the years. Some of the most popular beaches inside the Bay and lining the Costera are Hornos, the traditional \"afternoon beach\", Papagayo, Tamarindos, and Icacos. Condesa beach at the east end of the bay is gay-friendly. Caleta/Caletilla beaches and Langosta Beach are on the open ocean, and usually a bit cleaner. Most hotels in Acapulco are found along the Costera, and prices generally go down as you move west toward the Zócalo and old Acapulco.\n\nAnother open water beach, more suitable for surfing, lies in front of the Fairmont Acapulco Princess and Fairmont Pierre Marqués Hotels. Playa Revolcadero is east of Acapulco, closer to the airport. The wave action is much higher than inside the bay or at Caleta/Caletilla, which are protected by La Roqueta island. Transportation from La Costera takes about 35&amp;nbsp;minutes through a winding and scenic road.\n\nDon't miss Barra Vieja, approximately 20 minutes past the airport coming from the Costera (M$500–800 for a cab all day).\n\n==Do==\n* \n\nThere are several more attractions, including golf courses, night clubs and post-Hispanic fortifications. Nightlife in Acapulco is pretty much fun, and many places are suited for tourism including \"El Alebrije\", \"Disco Beach\" and \"Palladium\", this last having an awe-inspiring sight of the whole bay of Acapulco.\n* \n\n==Buy==\n* \n\n==Eat==\n* \n* \n* \n\n==Drink==\n* \n* \n\n''La Costera'', Acapulco's main street along the coast, is full of bars and clubs:\n\n* \n* \n\n==Sleep==\n===Budget===\n* \n* \n\n===Splurge===\n* \n* \n* \n\n==Stay safe==\n\nFor an average tourist, a common danger comes from local police. Bribery and extortion can be encountered at every step. For example, if you are driving a nice clean car, you can expect to be stopped and falsely blamed for driving through red lights (even if the traffic lights were turned off), not using mirrors, using traffic lanes wrongly or other minor infractions.\n\n==Cope==\n\n===Consulates===\n\n*  \n\n==Go next==\n* Taxco is along the way from Acapulco to Toluca, and just off the highway to Mexico City. Some guidebooks depict it as an adorable little town filled with silver shops, but many drivers have come to dread the crowded, narrow, windy roads. The caution under \"Stay safe\" above also applies.\n* Ixtapan de la Sal is about an hour past Taxco on the way to Toluca. It boasts a perfect climate and thermal waters. There are modern water parks, spas, and a variety of folk health services. Caution as above.\n* Cuajinicuilapa is a small coastal town that is home to an Afro-Mexican community.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

                    "text": "\n\n'''Accra''' is the capital city of Ghana. Accra has a mix of 19th-century colonial architecture, modern skyscrapers and apartment blocks, and dusty shanty towns.\n\n==Understand==\nImage:Independence Arch - Accra, Ghana.jpg|thumb|Independence Arch\n\nAccra has an estimated population of 4—5 million in the metropolitan area. Since an administration reform in 2018 the city itself comprises only of the historic quarters and houses around 280,000 people. However, the surrounding municipal districts are tightly connected to the Accra Metropolitan District. Usually the whole metropolitan area is referred to as \"Accra\". The local language is Ga; other widely spoken languages are English, Twi (pron. 'ch-wee'), Ewe (pron. ayvay), and Hausa. \n\n===History===\n\nAccra was founded in the 17th century by the Ga people. It became the capital of the British Gold Coast in 1877 and the capital of Ghana on the formation of the country as an independent state in 1957.\n\n=== Climate ===\n\n\nAccra has a hot, semi-arid tropical climate. Rain falls during the rainy season, between April and mid-July, usually in the form of brief but intense thunderstorms that sometimes cause flooding. In the months of September and October, it may rain again, but less intensely. Daily temperatures throughout the year vary between 32ºC (89.6ºF) and 22ºC (71.6ºF).\n\n===Local information ===\n* [https://www.ama.gov.gh/ Municipal government website]\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By plane===\n | url=http://www.ghanaairports.com.gh/ | email=\n| address= | lat=5.604667 | long=-0.167389 | directions=\n| phone= | tollfree=\n| hours= | price=\n| wikidata=Q177689\n| content=\n}} is a major hub, with international connections from North America, Europe, Africa and the Middle East, along with internal connections to Kumasi, Tamale and Takoradi, and regional connections to virtually every West African country.\n\nAsky airlines fly to Banjul, Freetown, Monrovia, Lome\n\nFrom the United States, Delta Airlines and United airlines operates flights directly from New York City|New York-JFK and Washington, D.C.|Washington-Dulles. From there, it is possible to connect to all major North, South, and Latin American cities, and the Caribbean. \n\nSouth African Airways operates a service from Johannesburg. Ethiopian airlines from Addis Ababa. Kenya airways from Nairobi, Freetown, Monrovia Rwandair from Kigali. Royal Air Maroc from Casablanca. Egypt Air from Cairo.\n\nEmirates and Turkish Airlines operate into Accra, from their respective hubs in Dubai and Istanbul. It is also served by Middle East Airlines from Beirut and Qatar Airways from Doha.\n\nAir France operates from Paris's Charles de Gaulle. British Airways operates a daily service from London Heathrow. KLM also operates a daily service from Amsterdam. '''TAP Portugal''' has a direct service from Lisbon and Sao Tome, Brussels Airlines operates a service from Brussels.\n\n[https://www.ibomair.com Ibom Air] operates daily flights from Lagos City|Lagos, Nigeria to Accra.\n\n====Transport from the airport====\n\nThere is an official taxi stand. Make sure you find it if you want a regulated fare. Otherwise, expect to be taken for a ''very'' expensive ride. On the upside, though, the expensive car touts usually put you in a nicer car with a professional driver, and you get to skip any potential taxi confusion—you decide! Better yet, walk out to the main road and get a taxi for a real price.\n\n===By train===\n\nAlthough rehabilitation of the rail network is a priority of the government there's just one line operating. Regional commuter trains ply the route from the nearby industrial city of Tema, of limited interest to the tourist, several times a day. [http://grcl.gov.gh '''Ghana Railway Company'''] publishes timetables at their webpage.\n\n* \n\n==Get around==\n\n\n\n===By car===\n\nAccra's best attractions are scattered across a relatively wide area, so if you can afford the modest prices the best thing to do is hire a car and driver to take you around. Travel companies offer drivers who double as well-informed guides, which helps as interpretive exhibits and brochures (if you can find them) leave much to be desired.\n\nIf you need an SUV or a sedan there are plenty of affordable options because even the best drivers earn only about US$15 a day in Accra. You can book directly from Avis and local rental companies at the larger hotels, such as the Golden Tulip, La Palm, or La Badi Beach. Cars are available on short notice but if you want a van or SUV it is best to book ahead. Rates for car and driver are about US$9 an hour. For a US$75 you can book a 10-hour day, but fuel is extra.  Rates increase if you leave metro Accra, which is fair because poor roads add to the wear and tear on the vehicle. Toyota Land Cruisers are a popular choice and are widely available.\n\n===By foot===\n\nThough the city is fairly spread out, Accra is relatively safe to walk around during the day (and night, in many areas). Watch out for open sewers, automobiles, (even in the city) when walking the streets.\n\n===By taxi===\n\nTo flag a taxi wave your arm with your finger pointed down to the ground.  On a busy street you will have many taxis driving past trying to offer you their service by honking at you. There are very few Ghanaian cabs with meters. You must negotiate how much you are willing to pay before you start the trip. It is generally US$3 within the centre of town and US$10 to the airport or Accra Mall from the centre. A rough mileage rate would be US$ 0.30 per mile. Try to ask someone local how much a trip to a certain location usually costs. Also make sure to haggle hard, as most taxi drivers will often try to charge three times (or more) the going rate to foreigners. Relax, and don't show urgency. If the first taxi won't come down on his price, wait for another as they are plentiful. Do have an idea of your route: taxi drivers navigate by landmarks, e. g. traffic circles, traffic lights, petrol stations – not street names – and make sure you have a local SIM in your phone so you can ring someone at your destination and pass the phone to the taxi driver.\n\nTaxis do not have to be so private, though, and it's exceedingly rare for Ghanaians to hire one privately (although they will assume that foreigners want a private one). The rate is in theory one fourth of a private ride, but, again, foreigners taking a private ride tend to get taken for a little extra. It's more confusing, to be sure, but chances are they are going in the direction they are already headed, and you can just ask if they're going towards a major landmark, especially a market.\n\nThe problem with taxis, aside from the constant honking at foreigners, is that they '''don't know their way around''' Accra. No really, they won't have any idea where you want to go. They can't figure out maps either. The landmarks used by locals and cab drivers in no way align with those that are relevant to outsiders. Even worse, the cab drivers usually live kind of far outside the city centre, and usually aren't even familiar with basic neighbourhood names or the biggest attractions like Independence Square! Some useful landmarks that they will know are the major markets, Osu Castle, the Stadium, the financial centre (Cedi Tower), the major traffic circles along Ring Rd, and major street names, from which you can try and direct them to where you want to go. Now, if you don't already know your way around, it's tough.\n\n====Metered taxi====\n\nThere are some taxis with meters in them. These are generally more expensive, but you can be a little more sure about how much they will cost.\n\n====Ride hailing====\n# [https://yango.yandex.com/en_gh/passenger/ Yango] app works in Accra.\n# [https://www.uber.com Uber] also works in Accra.\n# [https://bolt.eu/en-gh/ Bolt] which is very popular.\n\n===By TroTro===\n\nTroTros are usually very crowded and dilapidated minivans ad minibuses that act as the city's public transit system. TroTros travel along a well known routes in the city, and stop at various points along the way (some stops have signs, others don't). As a TroTro approaches a stop, a \"mate\" (the driver's assistant) will usually yell out the side of the window where the TroTro is going. Many people die in TroTro accidents every year, however typically on highways in rural areas. Accidents causing death in Accra are relatively rare, in part due to traffic congestion.\n\n==See==\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* &lt;!--\n--&gt; \n* &lt;!--\n--&gt;\n* \n* The oldest part of Accra, which remains an active fishing centre. It is similar in many ways to Zanzibar's Stone Town, though it has not yet been restored, so it is not typically highlighted on tourist itineraries. Despite this, for many visitors, it is one of the most memorable sights in the city. Jamestown is a short distance west from Independence Square; from the busy street the only real sights are the lighthouse, a prison building housed inside an old colonial fort, and the old Customs House. From the lighthouse there is a road which takes you to the otherwise hidden delight: one of the largest working fishing harbours in Ghana. Go early in the morning and see dozens of small boats bring in the day's catch. It's best to find a friendly local guide so you don't miss the hidden alleys, old stone houses, and fantastic cliff-top harbour vistas.\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n=== Churches ===\n* \n* \n* \n\n=== Mosques ===\n* \n* \n\n==Do==\n* \n* \n\n'''Swimming Pools:''' Sport swimmers find a pool in East Legon at [http://www.aandcmall.com A&amp;C Mall] for 7 cedis a day.

                    "text": "\n'''Accrington''' is a town in East Lancashire. The town's main visitor attraction is the Tiffany glass collection in its art gallery, and the stark natural beauty of the Pennine moors all around. It's also notorious for its football team Accrington Stanley, which until 2019 was unfairly regarded as a joke and byword for failure. But not any more.  \n\nThe small towns of '''Baxenden''', '''Oswaldtwistle''' (say ''ozzle-twizzle'') and '''Clayton-le-Moors''' are nearby, and Blackburn is five miles west.\n\n==Understand==\n\nIts name probably means \"acorns\" from the oak woods that once carpeted these valleys. It grew during the industrial revolution, when the streams racing down from the Pennines powered its textile mills\n\nIt had a population of 35,000 in 2011, with a total of 80,000 in the borough of Hyndburn area. Many of its residents are Bangladeshis who came to work the mills in the 1950s. The town also produced Accrington Brick or ''NORI'' (\"Iron\" backwards), an exceptionally hard and acid-resistant brick, valuable for lining furnaces, chimneys and the like. The brickworks closed in 2008, were re-opened to political fanfare in 2015, and quietly closed again in 2016. The northern suburb of Ewbank gave its name to the carpet-sweeper manufacturer.\n\n===Football team===\n\nLots of towns have had football (soccer) teams that collapsed. But this place is unique, at least in Britain, in the way the collapse of Accrington Stanley hung like a pall over the name of the town for decades, in spite of the team's resurgence. One reason is that they collapsed in the 1960s, in an era when that was difficult to accomplish. England's Football League was a closed shop. Promotion and relegation between fourth division and the minor leagues below was rare.  \n\nFrom 1960 Accrington Stanley were near bankrupt, and fell like a stone through the League placings. By March 1962 their debts were unsustainable, they couldn't afford to put on games, and they had to resign from the League during the 61/62 season. It was a traumatic disorderly exit, and all their results were expunged. In the following seasons they played in the Lancashire Combination Leagues, and then they dissolved in 1966. \n\nAn entirely separate, new Accrington Stanley was formed in 1968, and for the next 30 years plodded away in the minor leagues. From 1989 to 1995 they were the butt of a TV advert by the Milk Marketing Board. One young football fan has been warned that if he doesn't drink milk, he'll only be good enough to play for Accrington Stanley. His friend asks \"Accrington Stanley, who are they?\" and the first replies \"Exactly.\" Town and club took a perverse pride in this recognition, but it didn't move the narrative on. \n\nIn 2002 the club came into money from a transfer fee and began a steady rise up the rankings. In 2006 they were promoted back into League Two, equivalent to the old Fourth. In 2018 they were promoted to League One.

It has a population of 4.2 million.\n\nIts major towns include: Banda Aceh (Aceh's capital), Lhokseumawe, Meulaboh, Sigli, and Calang. The island of Sabang (Indonesia)|Sabang (an hour's ferry ride from Banda Aceh), considered a diver's and snorkeler's paradise, belongs to the province.\n\n==Cities==\n\n\n*  – capital city of the province.\n*  – industrial city.\n*  – southernmost city, a place where roads meet. Capital of Southeast Aceh Regency.\n*  – mountainous city by Laut Tawar Lake, famous for its fish.\n* , Weh Island (''Pulau Weh'') – Blue Lagoon, snorkeling, famous for its fish. The westernmost point of Indonesia and Aceh's favorite beach getaway with some of Indonesia's best diving.\n* \n* \n\n==Other destinations==\n* \n*  &amp;mdash; surfing within easy striking distance of Banda Aceh. Nearby Lampuuk, is a beach and mountain area with a variety of accommodation and attractions.\n* \n*  &amp;mdash; The best place to visit Gunung Leuser National Park in the Aceh province. A small, quiet and charming village. However it is an effort to get there.\n\n==Understand==\nThe province of Aceh is in the northwest of Sumatra, with an area of approximately 57,365 km&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or 12.26% of the size of the island. It includes 119 islands, 73 major rivers and 2 lakes. Aceh is surrounded by the Straits of Malacca in the north, North Sumatra Province in the east and the Indian Ocean in the south and the west. The capital of Aceh is Banda Aceh.\n===History===\nAceh was long known for its desire for political independence from Indonesia. For many years, travel in this part of Indonesia was restricted by the government, due to a long war between the Indonesian Army and an Acehnese separatist guerrilla force known as the Free Aceh Movement (''Gerakan Aceh Merdeka'' or GAM in short).\n\nOn 26 December 2004, the coastal areas were devastated by a huge earthquake triggering a tsunami, which is estimated to have killed over 160,000 people in Aceh and completely devastated coastal infrastructure (including the capital city of Banda Aceh), and made over 500,000 people homeless. The devastation in the wake of the tsunami led the Indonesian government and the GAM to declare a ceasefire in order to provide aid to the victims, setting the stage for peace talks to take place.\n\nA peace agreement was signed in Helsinki on 15 August 2005 between the Indonesian government and GAM, in which the GAM agreed to give up their struggle for independence in exchange for more autonomy being given to the provincial government in managing its internal affairs, including the right to enact Sharia law. Since then, the Indonesian government, in cooperation with the European Union, has been working with the local militia to disarm the former guerrilla fighters, with great success. After the tsunami, the UN and numerous international aid agencies moved in to reconstruct the area.\n\nAceh's shariah laws are stricter than in any other part of Southeast Asia, including Brunei, and even stricter than in Dubai, where non-Muslims are allowed to sunbathe in a bikini on the beach. In 2014, some ulemas spray painted the legs of women who wore tight jeans and trousers, because they felt that the sharia police were ineffective. So far no sharia laws have been enforced upon tourists, and non-Muslims are exempted from having to follow sharia laws, but to avoid unpleasantness for both parties, women should be modest in their clothing and behaviour. Conservative dress is expected, and this means no leggings, tight pants, shorts, or any tight or see-through clothing, but headscarves are not required for non-Muslims. One-piece conservative swimsuits, but not bikinis, are acceptable at some hotel swimming pools.\n\nAlthough Aceh enforces sharia law, some regencies such as Gayo Lues Regency do not fully support this. They are mostly Muslims, but don't want sharia to be implemented too hard. Some other regencies want to separate from Aceh, but the central government has not given any response to their requests. However, visitors should operate on the basis that Aceh is under sharia law, especially in the northern and eastern coastal regencies. On Friday, some vendors totally close or are open until 11:30 and either open again at 14:30 or stay closed until Saturday morning. Fishermen do not go to the sea and people don't swim on the beach on Friday, so if you want to swim on Friday, make sure beforehand that you won't cause offense.\n\nBackpacking into the back country in Aceh is safe from landmines because the GAM used only pipe-bombs. The areas around Banda Aceh and along east coast are relatively ready for tourists, but along the west coast of Aceh, which has more beautiful scenery, there are fewer facilities for tourists. However, backpackers can use their own tents on the beach as they wish.\n\n===Flora and fauna===\nThe largest portion of Leuser National Park is in Aceh Province, and provides habitat for many endangered species, including the Sumatran Tiger and forest Rhinoceros.\n\n=== Watch ===\n''The Black Road'' is a documentary from 2005 told by an American journalist who was in Aceh between 2001–2003, interviewing those on both sides of the Aceh insurgency. During the course of the documentary, it becomes clear that the journalist has begun to support the GAM, and that one of the military's interpreters is a spy for GAM. The documentary is available on YouTube.\n\n==Talk==\nBahasa Indonesia is spoken but sometimes you will hear ''Bahasa Aceh'' (Acehnese), ''Bahasa Gayo'' (Gayonese), and other more minor languages.\n\n==Get in==\n===By plane===\n\nThe main airport of Aceh is Sultan Iskandar Muda International Airport () near Banda Aceh. There are international flights from Kuala Lumpur International Airport by [http://www.airasia.com AirAsia], and from Penang by [http://www.fireflyz.com.my Firefly]. Domestically, there are frequent flights from Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport by Garuda Indonesia and Lion Air, and from Jakarta's Halim Airport by Batik Air. Other domestic destinations include Medan, Bengkulu, and Batam.\n\nThere are various smaller airports across the province, such as Malikus Saleh Airport () and Cut Nyak Dien Airport (), with most of them only having scheduled flights from Medan, operated by Garuda Indonesia and/or Wings Air.\n\n===By bus===\nThe road from Medan to Banda Aceh is in reasonable condition. Especially the express night buses from Medan 10 hours, Rp200,000 are a good deal. Non-express day and night buses are cheaper (Rp150,000) and take longer - 12-14 hours. or you can use rent at [https://www.rentalmobil.my.id/aceh/rental-mobil-aceh rental mobil aceh].\n\n===By boat===\nThe ferry from Penang has stopped running. Instead, take the ferry to Medan and continue from there.\n\n==Get around==\nThere is no need for travel permits anymore in Aceh. Taxis, rental cars and motor taxis are available in Banda Aceh.\n\n==Sleep==\nThere are many hotels and also other types of accommodation available in Banda Aceh and the surrounding area. There are many cheap guest houses in the popular local beachside areas of Lhoknga and Lampuuk, there are a range of very affordable guest houses which cater mostly to international tourists, particularly surfers and adventurers.\n\n==See==\nAceh is rich in events, attractions and unique cultures that will fascinate anyone. Aceh is also rich in natural beauty, waves and sea gardens which are suitable for diving. However, some of the most beautiful Aceh tourism and historical sites and beaches were damaged by the massive earthquake and the tsunami in 2004.\n\nHighlights: the Baiturrahman Great Mosque, Aceh State Museum, the Graves of Sultan Iskandar Muda and of Teungku Syiah Kuala, Salahuddin Graveyard in Bitay (Turkey village), Ujong Batee and Lampuuk Beaches, Tjut Nyak Dien Museum, Rubiah Sea Garden, Simpang Balik Hot Water Pool, Linge Isaq Hunting Area, Leuser National Park, Cakra Donya Bell, remains of the Samudra Pasai Kingdom and Teungku Chik Di Tiro Heros Cemetery.\n\n===Itineraries===\nNature and outdoor lovers who arrive in Medan can travel from Medan to the jungle resort of Bukit Lawang and from there, go to the more remote Tangkahan. From Tangkahan, you can travel to the mysterious Danau Laut Tawar near Takengon were you can hike and climb some spectacular volcanoes. From Takengon you can travel to Banda Aceh. There you can visit some great beaches and go mountain biking and hiking. Banda Aceh is also the place to get a ferry to Sabang or Pulau Weh where you can dive and snorkel.\n\n==Do==\nThere is fantastic diving on Pulau Weh (called \"Sabang\" by the locals, the name of the city on the island).  If you're certified, expect to pay €25 for your first dive, €20 for every dive afterward.\n\nAceh is also great for hiking and mountain biking and bicycling.\n\nSurfing is great at Lhok'nga beach where you can also rent boards and do surfing courses. Also in nearby Lampuuk (3 km NE of Lhok'nga) a variety of beachside and mountain recreational attractions and activities is developing very rapidly. There are many restaurants and fresh seafood stalls. Some of the restaurants provide very affordable accommodation, some with panoramic views of the mountains, beaches and seaside area.\n\n==Eat==\n\nArab, Persian, and Indian traders influenced food in Aceh although flavours have changed to a point where they are no longer similar to their original form. Amongst these are curry dishes known as '''kare''' or '''gulai''', which are rich, coconut-based dishes traditionally made with beef, goat, fish or poultry, but now also made with tofu, vegetables, and jackfruit. Popular Acehnese food includes '''roti cane''' and '''mie Aceh'''.\n\nNew restaurants and seafood stalls are popping up all the time in the local Lhoknga and Lampuuk seaside areas of Banda Aceh as the local economy develops.\n\nYou will have trouble finding food during the daytime during Travelling during Ramadan|Ramadan, and also 2-3 days immediately before and after the Islamic holy month.\n\n==Stay safe==\nThe insurgency may be over, but Aceh remains a somewhat unsettled place, with a rate of violent crime higher than average for Indonesia. In 2009, a German Red Cross worker was shot in broad daylight in Banda Aceh. In 2014 the situation was relatively safe.\n\nAceh has adopted a strict version of the Shariah law, which prohibits, among other things, drinking, homosexuality, intimate contact outside marriage, gambling, adultery and wearing revealing clothes in public spaces (including public beaches). Since 2016, such laws have been applied both to Muslims and non-Muslims, so make sure you don't violate them. If you do, the punishment for Muslims who drink alcohol or are together with a person of the other sex to whom they are neither a close relative nor married is to be publicly whipped and fined or imprisoned, whereas non-Muslims can choose which of these punishments to suffer, and even playing online games in public can be punishable by getting whipped.\n\n==Go next==\n* To the south: take a flight from Banda Aceh to Medan, if you are in a rush. You can also use the bus, but there are no special views along the trip. From Medan, you can spend one day in Brastagi or you can spare more time, if you want one day to hike to or climb Sibayak Mountain and one day more to hike to or climb Sinabung Mountain. Neither of these mountains is too difficult to hike, if you are fit, but you need a guide to avoid getting lost. Spare two days in Lake Toba, even if you are not going anywhere around the lake.\n\n\n\n\n"

It's Ireland's largest island, with some farming but mostly uncultivated heath and hills. The two main settlements are Achill Sound by the bridge and Keel straggling into Dooagh near the west tip; in 2021 its population was 2350. Everyone speaks English but many residents are Irish speakers, especially on the east side of the island. \n\n==Understand ==\nThe 2023 film, ''The Banshees of Inisherin'', was largely filmed on location on Achill Island, and partially shot on Inis Mór in County Galway.\n\n* [https://achilltourism.com/ Achill Tourism] website\n\n== Get in ==\n\nAchill Island is reached by road. From Dublin follow N5 to Castlebar, R311 to Newport then N59 to Mulranny. Branch off onto R319 which crosses the bridge to the island and continues west to Dooagh. Or from Mulranny take the lonely scenic lane, clearly signposted off N59 before the R319 turnoff, which loops around the south coast of Corraun Peninsula to rejoin R319 near the bridge.\n\nBus 450 follows the coast from Louisburgh via Westport (Ireland) | Westport (which has trains from Dublin Heuston), Newport (County Mayo) | Newport and Mulranny, then across Achill Island via Bunacurry, Dooninver (for Inishbiggle), Doogort, Slievemore (for deserted village), Keel and  outside Lourdie's Pub. It runs M-Sa every 2-3 hours, with only three on Sunday.\n\nA ferry crosses the sound to Inishbiggle, from both Achill Island and the mainland. It's a route to Inishbiggle not a practical way of reaching Achill.\n\n== Get around ==\nIt's a sparse bus service so you need your own wheels. The terrain is low-lying and the distances not great so a bike will do nicely. Bike hire is available at the bridge from [https://www.clewbaybikehire.ie/ Clew Bay Bike Hire] and [https://westportbikehire.com/ Westport Bike Hire], and in Dooagh from [https://www.achillbikes.com/ Achill Bikes].\n\nDon't ride the ghostly railway! — ooo you'll never be seen alive again. The 17th-century Mayo prophet Brian Rua U'Cearbhain foresaw that \"carriages on wheels with smoke and fire will come to Achill and the first and last carriages will carry dead bodies\" — and twas so. In 1894 the Westport-Newport railway was extended to Achill Sound, the track now forming the Greenway. Its first run brought home the 32 victims of the Clew Bay drowning disaster. At Westport, young men of the island were transferring first by currachs to low-sided sailing Hookers, then to the steamer that would take them to Scotland for seasonal work picking potatoes; the first Hooker was overcrowded and capsized. And in 1937, it was almost the last run before the railway closed that returned the bodies of ten Achill men from Kirkintilloch in Scotland: they were picking potatoes but died in a fire at their bothy accommodation. And on dark windy nights on the island, you often hear a shrilling noise... nah, just a burglar alarm going off.\n\n== See ==\n\n*  is how you cross onto the island. It's a swing bridge to let boats pass, first opened in 1887 and named for the founder of the National Land League. Modern road traffic and salt corrosion have worn out two bridges so the present structure from 2009 is the third. Achill Sound village is mostly on the island side, with the mainland side called Polranny. Nice views up and down the Sound, use the car parks either side. \n* '''Saula''' (''Sáile'') is the peninsula and settlement north of Achill Sound village. It's low-lying heathland. \n*  (''Cill Damhnait'') is a straggling village near the island's south tip. Kildavnet Tower is a sturdy 15th century turret; you can't go in. It's billed as \"Grace O'Malley's Castle\" which is accurate enough, since in Elizabethan times she owned the county. 500 m north past the coastguard station, Old St Dympna's Church is a medieval ruin. From the top end of the graveyard (where many famine victims lie), you may spot the abandoned village of Ailt. Kildavnet means \"small church of St Dympna\", herself 7th century and presumably teensy-weensy even before her father beheaded her for refusing to be his incestuous bride, tis said. \n*  - \"Little Achill\" - is the island off the south tip, uninhabited since 1965. There's a lighthouse, walking trails and sea cliffs. Boats may visit from Cloughmore near Kildavnet but there's no ferry. \n*  (''Bun an Churraigh'') is a small village with a [https://achillheritagecentre.com/ heritage centre], a distillery (see Drink) and the tumbledown remains of a Franciscan friary established in 1852. This engaged in many aspects of social welfare but of all the rousing campaigns of the Church Militant and Triumphant on the island in that era, none were as spirited as the battle between the friary and the rival Protestant Mission at nearby Doogort. \n*  is a settlement of 80 derelict single-room cottages, with their vegetable patches, fields and potato plots. Its residents left when famine struck in 1845, mostly moving to Dooagh to take up fishing. However until the 1940s it was still used as a \"booley village\": summer huts for herdsmen, when the cattle were moved up from the lowlands. In Irish ''bó'' means \"cow\", and \"booley\" features in many place names, showing that this was a common form of transhumance. The site is free to enter, park by the modern graveyard and walk up the track. \n* '''A megalithic tomb''' lies on the hillside 1 km east of the deserted village. \n*  on the north coast can only be reached by hiking over the hills or by boat. There's a wild attractive valley, a freshwater lough backed up behind a glacial moraine, and an excellent beach. Just west are the remains of another \"booley village\". \n\n*  is the attractive cove and beach at the end of R319, with Croaghaun rearing up behind. In the 1950s / 60s it was a base for catching basking sharks: in a strange juxtaposition, they launched frail open currachs that Saint Patrick would have recognised to hunt the sharks for liver oil, a lubricant for the aerospace industry - think Vickers VC10s, Telstar and Concorde. A walking trail heads up the valley and west for 1.5 km to the tip of the island at Achill Head. The sea cliffs on the north side are spectacular, with a tumult of sea birds.\n*  is the only settlement on the north coast, with good beaches and accommodation. East is an area of woodland and little lakes embellished into a twee \"Faerie Trail\". Valley House (now a pub) has a shocking history, echoed in fiction such as ''Playboy of the Western World'': in 1894 the landowner fell out with her bailiff and evicted him. He attacked her, set fire to the house and left her for dead. She survived with terrible burns, he fled to the US and never faced trial, while the house was re-built in 1902. The writers Heinrich Böll and Graham Greene often holidayed in Doogort. \n*  (''Dún Ibhir'', Ivor's Fort) has a good beach and views north.

                    "text": "\nThe '''Achterhoek''' is a region in the east of Gelderland (the Netherlands). The region is filled with untouched nature and a combination of farmland and astonishing landscapes. The Achterhoek is an area well suited for vacations by bike.\n\n==Cities==\n\n\n\n== Other destinations ==\n* '''Bronckhorst|Bronkhorst''' - Smallest city in the Netherlands, with a population of about 157.\n* ''''s-Heerenberg''' - Village most known for the Bergh castle.\n\n== Understand ==\n=== History ===\n\nThe Achterhoek was inhabited by Germanic tribes and was never a part of the Roman Empire.  At Christianization around the year 800, it was not a region of its own - the west belonged to the Utrecht (province)|Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Utrecht and the east to the Münster|Roman Catholic Diocese of Münster. The region only came to exist as the Zutphen Country during Medieval times. The area encompassed many castles, many of which stand to this day.  Most were owned by the royal families of Bronkhorst and Van Heeckeren, which fought several succession wars against each other. Until the 19th century the Achterhoek had a feudal system.\n\nDue to the region's location at the border, it was invaded several times - mostly by German entities during the w:Guelders Wars|Guelders and Thirty Years War|Eighty Years War.  Battles were fought mostly around the 's-Heerenberg|Bergh Castle and Keppel|Keppel Castle, as well as the cities of Bredevoort and Groenlo. The Battle of Grolle of 1627 is reenacted bi-annually in Groenlo.\n\nDuring industrialisation, a large part of the Achterhoek was still feudal. Much of the land was still undeveloped, consisting of forests and sand flats. Industrialisation had an effect only on the cities along the Oude IJssel river and in the far east.  As the ground contained bog iron, a hype for metallurgy hit Doetinchem, Oude IJsselstreek|Ulft and Keppel, under the Dutch brands of ATAG, DRU and Pelgrim. In the east of the Achterhoek, textile industries boomed and continued in Aalten, Neede and Winterswijk until the end of the Second World War, when due to competition from low-wage countries the industry was no longer viable.  During the time that it thrived, the textile industry made large invests in the region, especially by Winterswijkse magnate Jan Willink who funded many railroads throughout the region. This helped the textile industry survive in the rather remote east. Of these railroads, only the lines between Arnhem and Winterswijk and Winterswijk and Zutphen remain. Additionally, a heritage railroads|heritage railroad, formerly spanning between Doetinchem and Hengelo|Hengelo (Overijssel) remains functional between Haaksbergen and Boekelo, both located just across the provincial border in Overijssel. These lines initially improved industry in the region, and now do the same for tourism.\n\nSince the beginning of the 21st century, decreasing profits have caused many companies to fold or leave.  For example, the local pilsner brand, ''Grosch'', for one, left the region in order to remain profitable.  Replacing it is a new wine industry, which nets between 20,000 and 40,000 bottles annually.\n\n\n'''&lt;big&gt;Geography&lt;/big&gt;''']]\nThe Achterhoek, compared to the Netherlands as a whole, is not densely populated.  Aside from the relatively urbanised regions of Doetinchem, Winterswijk and Zutphen, there are no large cities. \n\nSome of the natural landscapes from Roman times still remain.  Sand flats still exist near Doetinchem and large forests in Montferland. Due to its both flat and sloped terrain, the region is ideal for cycling by all levels of cyclists.  All in all, the Achterhoek features large amounts of pastureland divided into small hedged fields interspersed with groves of trees.   Highlights include the Lochem|Lochemse Berg, the Ruurlo|Ruurlo Woods and the Doetinchem|Slangenburg. Some peatlands still exist near the German border.\n\nMany castles are spread throughout the region with Vorden having a total of eight. \n\n=== Traditions ===\nThough the culture is considered to be dying, parts of the Achterhoek still have traditions.  These include ''dauwtrappen'' on Ascension Day (getting up ''very'' early to go cycling), ''carbidschieten'' (filling a milk churn with carbide, putting a ball in the churn's opening and igniting it) and the consumption of w:Krumkake|Krumkake during New Years. At Easter, many bonfires (''Paasvuur'') are lit, and at the completion of a building, a maypole may be erected.  Further, local 'sports' include ''spiekerboksehangen'', or hanging a pair of jeans above a body of water and competing to determine who can keep himself out of the  water the longest. Typical in the east is ''noaberschap'', literally translated as 'helping of neighbours', but it's really general kindness.\n\n==Talk==\n\nAll of the Achterhoek speaks Dutch, and in more rural areas many people also speak the local dialect, Low_German_phrasebook|Achterhooks, which is part of Low German.  In the cities and larger towns, many people speak English, especially the younger generation, and also German.\n\n==Get in==\n\n===From Amsterdam/Schiphol===\n\nTo get to '''Zutphen''' or '''Winterswijk''', take the Intercity train to Apeldoorn and change in Apeldoorn to the small diesel train connection Zutphen and Apeldoorn in 20 minutes. It leaves from Apeldoorn at --:10 and --:40, a few minutes after the Intercity from Amsterdam arrived. It usually departs from the opposite side of the platform. Alternatively, you can reach Zutphen via Arnhem by changing there, but it will take about 10 to 15 minutes longer and doesn't cost more (i.e. with a ticket to or from Zutphen, you can choose between the Apeldoorn and Arnhem routes). See the article on Zutphen for more extensive information. For '''Winterswijk''', trains leave at --:07 and --:37, and depending on the route taken (Amsterdam-Apeldoorn-Zutphen) or (Amsterdam-Arnhem-Zutphen) will take either 135 or 153 minutes.\n\nTo get to '''Doetinchem''', take the Intercity to Nijmegen and change trains in Arnhem. The train to Doetinchem and Winterswijk leaves 2 minutes after the arrival of the Intercity from Amsterdam, at --:04 and --:34, usually from platform 9. These trains take 34 minutes to Doetinchem and 68 minutes to Winterswijk, during the morning and afternoon rush there are 2 more to Doetinchem, at --:15, and --:45. For Winterswijk it's better to travel through Zutphen instead of Arnhem when coming from Amsterdam. To Doetinchem this should take 102 minutes, but it's likely to take 30 minutes longer because there's only a 2 minute change in Arnhem, which one is likely to miss.\n\nNot all towns can be reached by train. The ones that can be reached are: &lt;br/&gt;\nDoetinchem, Zutphen, Winterswijk, Lochem, Vorden, Ruurlo and Aalten\n\n===From Germany===\n\nTo get to any of the cities above, head to Oberhausen (GER) first, whether by train or car.  By car, use the A3 in the direction of Arnhem, Utrecht or Amsterdam. To get to '''Doetinchem''' or '''Zutphen''' from there, leave the A3 as soon as you cross the border, at Exit 30 .  Jin the N812 heading for Beek.  At the end of the N812, join the N335 heading for Didam.  Then join A18 in the direction of Doetinchem. \n\n&lt;br /&gt;When travelling to '''Zutphen''', take the route above, but leave the highway at Exit 3 - Doetinchem.  Use the N316/N317 in the direction of Doetinchem.  To avoid getting stuck in traffic, take the N317 (Liemersweg) after crossing the rail line, and head right onto the Energieweg at the next traffic lights.   After crossing the Oude IJssel river, head left at the end of the Energieweg, onto the Keppelseweg, heading for Zutphen. Follow this road until you reach the roundabout after Langerak. There take the first exit onto the N314.   When you reach Hummelo, head left on the roundabout, and head in the direction of Zutphen.  From there on, the road goes directly to Zutphen.\n\n==Get around==\nThe Achterhoek can be travelled by train, but as there are no train stations between Arnhem and Winterswijk via Zevenaar and Doetinchem, as well as Zutphen and Winterswijk via Vorden and Oost Gelre|Lievelde, a bus is recommended for most destinations.  Bus service is provided primarily by [https://www.arriva.nl/gelderland.htm?regioid=98879 Arriva].  Train service is also provided by [https://www.breng.nl/ Breng]. To plan travel by public transport, [http://www.9292.nl 9292] is recommended.   Or you can rent a car or bike.  Bike routes are of high quality and are well maintained.        \n\n==See==\n\n\n* The Achterhoek has many '''Castles'''.  Vorden alone has seven of them. Though not all can be visited, many are open to the public for a reasonable entry fee. Must-sees include ''Kasteel Huis Bergh'' (''Bergh Castle''), located in Liemers|'s-Heerenberg and ''Kasteel Keppel'' (''Keppel Castle'') in Keppel|Laag Keppel\n* '''Museums''' in the Achterhoek are mostly local town museums. They generally display only items of interest to locals. Visiting these isn't a must, but they might appeal.  DDoetinchem|oetinchem and Winterswijk have the ''Openbaar Vervoer Museum'' and ''GOLS Museum'', both of which highlight the role of public transport, especially trains and trams, for the region.\n* Oost Gelre has several large '''events,''' including the ''De Zwarte Cross'' which is held annually.  It is the largest motocross event of Europe featuring not only motorised vehicles, but live music as well.  In addition, annually, Lichtenvoorde houses one of the largest flower parades of the Netherlands, if not Europe, called ''Bloemencorso Lichtenvoorde''. \n* '''Beautiful landscapes''' are common in the Achterhoek due to its semi-rural character. Terrains are flatter in the northwest of the region, and more sloped in the Montferland area in the south. The rivers in the area meandered a lot more i the past but have straightened somewhat over time.  Their smaller branches are now mostly small lakes.  All of these rivers and lakes provide opportunities for beautiful photos. The Oude IJssel river around Keppel is especially beautiful during the summer.\n\n==Do==\n* The Achterhoek is ideal for '''hiking,''' especially in the well-forested area of Monferland which is great for a long walk during summer or fall. The Pieterpad also passes through this area.   Every year a four-day hiking event is held sometime during the month of May (in 2017, from the 24th to the 27th). The ''[http://www.aw4d.nl Achterhoekse Wandelvierdaagse]'' usually takes place in and around Doetinchem. Its routes are available [http://www.aw4d.nl/routes.asp online] (although only in Dutch) if you wish to participate.\n* '''Cycling in the Achterhoek|Cycling''' is the most common mode of transport for the Dutch, including for Achterhoekers.   Routes vary, with the above mentioned Montferland area having off-road routes with terrain that varies in elevation.  The terrain becomes flatter towards the German border.  You can easily travel from one town or city to another within half a day, making a vacation by bike an ideal option.\n* '''Recreational waters''' are a popular with locals. Many former sand mining operations have been intentionally flooded to transform them into recreational lakes. The Liemers has three of these, and another can been found just south of Zutphen.\n* '''Canoeing''' or '''Kayaking''' is not possible on many of the rivers as they are used for freight transport.  However, the Oude IJssel river, is perfect for this canoeing or kayaking.  Routes start in Doetinchem and upstream near Terborg, and end in Doesburg.\n\n==Eat==\n\n* The Achterhoek does not have many local products to its name, except the city of Doesburg which has its own '''mustard.  I'''f you like mustard, it's definitely worth a try.\n\n==Drink==\n* The beer brand '''Grolsch''' (English: ''from Grol''), founded in Groenlo and based in Enschede, just outside the Achterhoek, supplies pilsner in the entire country and many parts of the world.  Trips to the brewery are interesting.\n\n==Go next==\nFrom the Achterhoek, you can easily go further north towards Twente, Overijssel, Drenthe, Groningen and Friesland.&lt;br/&gt;\nYou can also head south towards North Brabant, Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg and Zeeland.&lt;br/&gt;\nIf you prefer to visit large cities, head for the Randstad in the provinces of Noord Holland|North- and Zuid-Holland|South-Holland or Utrecht.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It is home to a very busy port as well as the main industrial and administrative centre of the area.\n\n== Understand ==\n\n=== Orientation ===\nA Coruña is located on a peninsula on the northwestern corner of Spain. Originally, it was just a tiny strip of land, but over time, sand and rock built up to form the area we see today. In A Coruña, autumn and winter are usually unpredictable, with everything from overcast to snow. Summers are mostly sunny, and rain is rare. Spring is the most stable season in the city, with cool temperatures and calm weather.\n\nA Coruña has a ring road that runs around the edge of the coast. The city is divided up into five parishes.\n\nA Coruña is also known for its characteristic glazed window balconies, called galerías. These balconies were first designed as a naval solution for bad weather and rainy days. However, in the 18th century, workers at the Royal Dockyards had the idea of putting these balconies on modern buildings: and the fashion was born.\n\nMost of A Coruña's historic sights can be found in its Old Town, or ''Cidade Vella''. Notable buildings in the Old Town are the Royal Galician Academy, the churches of Santiago and Saint Mary, As Bárbaras Monastery, and the headquarters of the Operational Logistics Force of the Spanish Army. Each year in July, a Medieval Fair also takes place in the Old Town.\n\n=== Climate ===\nBeing exposed to Atlantic winds and low-pressure systems bringing plenty of rainfall for most of the year, it has the coolest summers of Spain's major urban areas, but likewise has very mild winters for its latitude.\n\n==Get in==\n\n=== By plane===\n*  | url=http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-A-Coruna/en/Page/1048146841342/ | email=\n| address= | lat=43.301944 | long=-8.377222 | directions=located in the Culleredo municipal limits,  from A Coruña\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\n| hours= | price=\n| wikipedia=A Coruña Airport | image=Alvedro.jpg | wikidata=Q1430713\n| content=It has national and international connections and is used by Iberia, Vueling, Air Europa and TAP Air Portugal.

It receives long distance RENFE trains from destinations within Spain. Two railway lines terminate at this station. They begin in León and Zamora and connect A Coruña with central Spain. High-speed trains connect the city with Santiago de Compostela, Ourense-Empalme, Pontevedra and Vigo-Guixar. Regional lines also connect the city with Lugo, Monforte de Lemos and Ferrol.

Acre is the greenest state of Brazil, with over 50% of its territory protected somehow. Important figures on the national environmentalist movement, such as Chico Mendes and Marina Silva, come from here.\n\n\n==Cities==\n\n* — the capital and the biggest city of the state is a pleasant town with interesting architecture, usually inspired by forest or native culture elements\n* — across the Xapuri River from the Bolivian city of Cobija\n* — most important tourist and economic center in the interior of Acre, it has many buildings and monuments that symbolize and preserve the history of Acre\n* — on the right bank of the Envira River , which is the main means of transporting production for riverside dwellers\n* — on the left bank of the Abunã River, across from the Bolivian town of Puerto Evo Morales\n* — it has the oldest church in Acre, built in 1910\n* — known as \"the land of the giant pineapple\", where the fruit weighs around 15 kg\n* — it draws visitors to its monuments to the Acre War and the house of Chico Mendes, and it has an eco-lodge at the Seringal Waterfall\n\n==Other destinations==\n*  — in the extreme west of the state, most of its territory is covered by the Amazon rainforest. The main rivers are the Juruá and the Moa, on the banks of which the Nukini Indians live. Authorization from Ibama is required for visitation.\n*  — with an important area covered by forest, it preserves the local flora and fauna, in the same place where the Itucumã rubber plantation was located, 10 km from Rio Branco.\n\n==Understand==\nAcre lives in Brazilian popular culture as \"the state that doesn't exist\", as in a conspiratory theory. Nothing could be more unfair, given this was the one state in the federation that went through an armed struggle to become part of the country.\n\nAcre is inhabited by various indigenous groups of the Panoan language family, including Kashinawa, Jaminawa and Xanenawa. There are also three groups of other language families, Madiha (Kulina) of the Arawan family as well as Yine (Manchineri) and Ashaninka (Kampa) of the Arawakan family.\n\n===History ===\nUntil the beginning of the 20th century, the territory occupied by Acre belonged to Bolivia. Intense extractive activity in the rubber industry attracted Brazilians from many regions to the state.  In 1899, Brazilian settlers from Acre created an independent state in the region called the Republic of Acre. Bolivians tried to gain control of the area, but Brazilians revolted and there were border confrontations. This resulted in what was known as the Acre War. On November 17, 1903, with the signing over and sale in the Treaty of Petrópolis, Brazil received final possession of the region.\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By plane===\n\nFlights from Rio Branco, state capital (). Connect in Brasilia () on Gol and Porto Velho () on Trip.\n\nCruzeiro do Sul International Airport provides helps access to the Alto Juruá region. .\n\n===By bus===\nBuses connect Rio Branco to Puerto Maldonado in Peru (9 hours) and with Porto Velho in Rondônia state (6 hours).\n\n===By car===\n\nThe highways that run through Acre are the BR-364, which connects the state to Rondônia and the Center-West, passing through the capital and reaching the extreme west, in Cruzeiro do Sul, and the BR-317, which goes from Rio Branco to Assis Brasil, on the triple border (Brazil, Bolivia, Peru).\n\n==Get around==\nThere are only 200 km of state highways, mostly near Rio Branco.\n\n===By boat===\nRiver transport, concentrated on the Juruá and Moa rivers, in the western part of the state, and the Tarauacá and Envira rivers in the northwest, is the principal form of transportation, especially between November and June. Heavy seasonal rains frequently make the BR-364 impassable in those months; it usually connects Rio Branco to Cruzeiro do Sul.\n\n==See==\nIn Rio Branco, visit the Palácio Rio Branco and Museu da Borracha museums to learn about the region's history.\n\n==Do==\nSerra do Divisor has a range of undeveloped terrains and wildlife. In one month, ecologists counted: 43 large mammal species, more than 100 amphibian and 30 reptile species, 485 bird species, 55 species of bats, and 29 spider families.\n\n==Eat==\nAcre cuisine mixes Northeastern, Pará, Bolivian, indigenous and Arab cuisine. From this mixture came duck in tucupi, tacacá, sun-dried meat with baião de dois, fish stew, tapioca, spicy chicken and cigars. Exotic fruits yield excellent juices and desserts: graviola, cajá, cajarana, cupuaçu, etc. From the forest come peach palm, Brazil nut, guarana, buriti and açaí.\n\nAcre state is one of the biggest producers of açaí in Brazil. This purple juice extracted from the fruit of a palm tree gained international fame as a superfood, consumed in form of a frozen cream to which fruits or nuts are added. However, the local way to consume it is to mix the fresh unsweetened juice to a bit of manioc flour (for crunchiness) and then add sugar, condensed milk and/or powdered milk.\n\nAnother local delicacy is tacacá, a broth made with manioc water and jambu, a leaf that causes an effect between hotness and light numbness of the mouth. When asked how much goma you want, start with \"little\" because this goey paste is an acquired taste, but don't skip it as it dissolves into the broth, giving it a nice thickness. It is served in a bowl, and you are supposed to drink directly from it, Japanese-style.\n\n==Drink==\n\n==Stay safe==\n\n==Go next==\n\n\n\n"

                    "text": "\n:''See Rail travel in Australia for general information about travelling by train in Australia''\n\nAustralia can be crossed by two great railway journeys, '''''The Ghan''''', which crosses north to south straight through the heart of Australia, from Darwin to Adelaide, and the '''''Indian Pacific''''', which crosses east to west, from Sydney to Perth.\n\n==Understand==\n\n\n===History of the Ghan===\n''The Ghan'' is named after the Afghan cameleers that transported goods to Australia's remote centre prior to the construction of the railway.  The sand and heat made the trip entirely unsuited to horses. The cameleers overwhelmingly weren't from Afghanistan, they were just known as Afghans in the Australian vernacular.\n\nThe construction of the original Ghan from Adelaide started in 1878, with Oodnadatta reached in 1891 and, after a thirty-year break, Alice Springs in 1926. A separate but unconnected track from Darwin to Katherine in the north was also completed in the same year; this line was closed in 1976.\n\nUnfortunately, the original Ghan was twisty, narrow-gauge and built straight through many valleys prone to flash floods that washed away tracks and bridges. A decision was thus made to rebuild nearly all of the line in standard gauge, over 100&amp;nbsp;km to the west. The new line to Alice Springs opened in 1980, and the remaining  section across the continent to Darwin opened in 2004.\n\n===History of the ''Indian Pacific''===\nA single train journey from Sydney to Perth (linking the Indian and Pacific Oceans) became possible with the completion of the standard gauge railway in 1969 when the last standard gauge link was completed between Broken Hill and Peterborough (South Australia)|Peterborough. Prior to this, travelling across Australia by train between Perth and Sydney was a relay of trains.  At certain times in history there were four changes of railway gauge, at Broken Hill, Peterborough, Port Pirie, and Kalgoorlie.  The great mining town of Broken Hill was linked by the narrow-gauge railways to Port Pirie (north of Adelaide) before it was linked with Sydney.  You can see some of this history in the Sulphide Street Railway Museum in Broken Hill, at Steamtown in Peterborough, and at the museum in the old station at Port Pirie. The railway line in Port Pirie ran right down the main street of the town.  In the 1930s, the transcontinental trip was over five days, with changes of trains through Albury, Melbourne, Adelaide, Port Pirie and Kalgoorlie.\n\nThe breaks of gauge were due to the states each having their own gauge, and the Commonwealth completing the missing link between Port Pirie and Kalgoorlie in standard gauge (the same as New South Wales).\n\nSome towns along the line enjoyed several services a day during their heyday.  The full Sydney to Perth service ran three times a week.  Today, however, the irony is that railway buffs can see more of the rail history of the line and the towns along it travelling by car than by train.  You can spend a good half day exploring the history of Peterborough and of Port Pirie, but passenger trains no longer stop in either of them.\n\n==Prepare==\n\n\n\n\n===Find time===\nThese are not high-speed transcontinental trains. They are slow, laid back and luxurious trains that know how to take their time and let you enjoy the scenery. The trains are privately run by '''[https://www.journeybeyondrail.com.au/ Journey Beyond]'''. The current iteration of both routes was not built for passenger traffic, but rather to serve the very lucrative freight business.\n\n===Save up===\n\nAny way you look at it, ''The Ghan'' and the ''Indian Pacific'' are '''expensive'''. The more economical \"Red Service\" has been discontinued, and both trains now cater exclusively to the luxury market with an all-sleeper configuration. The lowest class of service is \"Gold Service\", which has single cabins (shared shower), twin cabins (shower en suite) and includes all meals in the dedicated restaurant car. This will set you back at least $2,115 on The Ghan, and $2,475 on the Indian Pacific in the low season, increasing to $2,845 on the Ghan and $2,835 on the Indian Pacific during the peak season. Add another $2000-4000 on top, and you can get a double-sized \"Platinum Service\" cabin, which also gets you a quieter dedicated lounge on board, and complimentary transfers from and to your place of accommodation at the start and end of your journey respectively.\n\nIf you have a car in Australia, the value proposition can improve slightly, if you take your car with you. On the premium fare there are often deals available to take a car for $99 extra, which you can then offset against the price of renting a car at your destination, or if you drive one way, the prospect of the 3000&amp;nbsp;km drive home. Taking your car with you is only possible when travelling from Adelaide to Perth and vice versa on the Indian Pacific, and when travelling from Adelaide to Darwin and vice versa on The Ghan. You will need to call Journey Beyond to make arrangements in advance if you want to take your car with you.\n\nYou cannot get off and board a few days later at most intermediate stations, as these trains are meant to be luxury rail cruises rather than practical modes of transportation. The exceptions are Adelaide, which is allowed as an intermediate stopping point for passengers on the Indian Pacific, and Alice Springs, which is allowed as an intermediate stopping point for passengers on The Ghan. Both these intermediate stops have to be arranged in advance, and you will need to book each leg separately if you want to stop off.\n\n==Get in==\nDarwin and Adelaide can be reached by plane from all major Australian cities and a few international destinations like Singapore, Denpasar, or Kuala Lumpur. Darwin does not serve any other passenger trains, while other passenger trains in Adelaide are limited to a twice-weekly service from Melbourne and its suburban rail network.\n\nSydney and Perth are well-connected by air, each with services to all other Australian capital cities and international destinations. There are public train services from the country towns of New South Wales to Sydney, as well as trains from Canberra, Brisbane and Melbourne. Perth is also served by trains connecting it to nearby country towns in the southern part of Western Australia.\n\n==The Ghan==\n\n\nThis itinerary assumes you start from Darwin and head south, but it's also possible in the opposite direction. The Ghan takes 54 hours to travel . The Ghan only operates between March and November, and does not operate between December and February as that is the rainy season in northern Australia.\n\n*  — ''From Darwin'' (0&amp;nbsp;km), there is a departure every '''Wednesday''' at 10AM between March and November. The three-day, two-night journey takes around 50&amp;nbsp;hours from end to end. The station is a fair way from central Darwin, about 20&amp;nbsp;minutes drive. The railway's primary purpose is freight, and the line goes straight to the port at East Arm, without passing through any built-up areas.  Dedicated buses connect between the Darwin Transit Centre in Mitchell St and the rail station for an additional fee.  Taxis are possible, but expensive. There is no scheduled bus.\n\n''From Adelaide'' (2979&amp;nbsp;km), departures are on '''Sunday''' 12:15PM between March and November, with an additional train on '''Wednesdays''' at the 12:10PM between April and October.\n\n*  (312&amp;nbsp;km) — ''The Ghan'' stops here for around five hours, with an optional guided \"Whistle Stop Tour\" available. The old railway from Darwin to Katherine stopped in central Katherine, and you can visit the site of the railway station. You can walk the old high level railway bridge across the Katherine river following the old alignment. However, it is around 10&amp;nbsp;km from the old station to the new one, so if you want to see Katherine, the tour may be your best option. You may not begin or end your journey here.\n\n*  (1420&amp;nbsp;km) — Alice Springs is the former northern terminus of ''The Ghan'' and the largest town by far en route. The train stops here for around four hours, long enough for a quick peek around town. The station is on the edge of the CBD, a couple of blocks walk to the Todd mall. Many people opt to break their journey here for a few days and visit Uluru, about 400&amp;nbsp;km away, but there is plenty to do for a few days in Alice and surrounds even if you don't venture to the Rock. Alice Springs has all the services to make it possible.\n\n*  — Marla is a purpose built highway service centre with nothing else there except the highway, train line and the station. The highlight of any visit there is to see ''The Ghan'' when it passes through, and the desert stretching off into the distance, if you are actually on ''The Ghan'' looking at the desert stretching off into the distance, best to stay on board. Only the northbound train stops here, during which you may step off the train to stretch your legs and watch the sunrise, but you may not begin or end your journey here.\n\n*  — Only the southbound train stops here, and only between on journeys made between March and November, during which you can get off to stretch your legs and gaze at the stars, but you may not begin or end your journey here. \n\n*  (2979&amp;nbsp;km) — The end of the line &amp;mdash; unless you switch onto the ''Indian Pacific'' and continue onward to Perth or Sydney.\n\n==The Indian Pacific==\n\n\n\nThis route connects the Perth on the Indian Ocean with Sydney on the Pacific Ocean. The 4,352 km trip takes about three days and is distance-wise by far the longest in the Southern Hemisphere and one of the longest domestic rail journeys in the world. It's notable for the 478 km long section across the Nullarbor Plain, which is the longest straight railway stretch in the world. Unlike The Ghan, the Indian Pacific runs year-round. From Sydney, the train departs every Wednesday at 1:55PM, while from Perth, the train departs every Sunday at 10AM. Motorail service (taking your car onto the train) is only available between Perth and Adelaide.\n\n*  — Either the destination of the ''Indian Pacific'' journey, or the point of departure, Perth is a useful terminus. The train ''Indian Pacific'' departs from the East Perth terminal, just two stations away from the Perth CBD. The city caters for all levels of travellers, with budget backpackers well catered for in Northbridge, the suburb immediately north of the city railway station - to the hotels in the CBD which cater for the high spenders.\n*  — Only the eastbound train stops here. An alternative to the long distance train ''Indian Pacific'', the local Prospector rail service runs a daytime service daily between Kalgoorlie and Perth, but covering the distance in half the time it takes the Indian Pacific to do so. The Kalgoorlie railway station itself is easy walking distance to the centre of town and accommodation Passengers on the eastbound train may join at tour of the town here while the train is stopped, but this is not available to westbound passengers as the train passes through in the middle of the night. The train passes through the picturesque Avon Valley on its way between Perth and Kalgoorlie.\n*  — Only the westbound train (towards Perth) stops here, and there is a live music performance on the platform. During the summer months, dinner is served on the platform, while at other times of the year, you will return on board the train to have dinner in the restaurant car. \n*  — Originally founded to service the railway, today it is a ghost town, where you will be allowed to walk around the station while your train is refuelled.\n*  — The capital of South Australia has many attractions and facilities, and is the gateway to many more. The Keswick station has been renamed the [https://journeybeyondrail.com.au/guest-information/stations-and-terminals/adelaide-parklands-terminal/ Adelaide Parklands Terminal], on account of it being on the outside of the Adelaide city greenbelt. There is no suburban rail service from Adelaide Parklands Terminal to Adelaide Railway Station in the City, and the nearest bus stop is a 15 minute walk from Adelaide Parklands Terminal. Taxi to the city is expensive, around $20, or you can call Uber. There are no real facilities or attractions in the station vicinity. The station itself is very basic, its only purpose being to serve the ''Indian Pacific'', ''Ghan''  and ''Overland'' trains that arrive a couple of times a week. You can get your car off here, and transfer between the two transcontinental services.\n*  — Only the westbound train stops here. Tours are offered here in the couple of hours that the train is at the station, with the coaches pulling up at the station at the same time as the train. If you choose not to take the coach tour, the railway station is right in the centre of town, and you can easily walk and spend time browsing the windows of a few galleries, returning to the station for breakfast. The tour is not available to passengers on the eastbound train as the train passes through in the middle of the night.\n*  — Only the eastbound train (towards Sydney) stops here. Passengers may get off here to join a tour of the Blue Mountains, and you will be later transported onwards to Sydney on one of NSW TrainLink's trains.\n*  — The orange-coloured Sydney Central station is located just south of the Central Business District, and is smaller than you might expect. In addition to being the eastern terminus for the Indian Pacific, it is one of the main nodes in the city's public transport system. Things to see at the station itself include the flags of Australian states and territories hanging from the ceiling and the small exhibition of Australian railway history. If you've just arrived by train, exit the main entrance, and walk straight on for half an hour or so and you'll see the Opera House on your right-hand side and Harbour Bridge on your left.\n\n==Stay safe==\nThough the journeys are long, and there are few chances of people just wandering in onto the train like in other countries, it is nevertheless wise to secure your room or items.\n\n==Go next==\n\n=== On a connecting train===\n''The Overland'' (which is also a Journey Beyond train) operates between Adelaide and Melbourne.  Unlike the ''Indian Pacific'' or ''The Ghan'', ''The Overland'' is a day trip and takes 10 hours, and it also stops at more intermediate stations to pick up and let off passengers. As it is subsidised by the Victorian and South Australian state governments, fares tend to be cheaper than for Journey Beyond's other trains.\n\nSydney and Perth are both served by country rail services that connect to various country towns. Country rail services from Sydney are operated by [http://www.nswtrainlink.info/ NSW TrainLink], while those from Perth are operated by [http://www.transwa.wa.gov.au/ TransWA]. NSW TrainLink also operates the ''Melbourne XPT'' from Sydney to Melbourne via Canberra, as well as the ''Brisbane XPT'' from Sydney to Brisbane. From Brisbane, the Gold Coast is easily accessible on the suburban network of [http://www.queenslandrail.com.au/ Queensland Rail], which also operates the long distance ''Spirit of Queensland'' all the way to Cairns.\n\n===And see what you missed===\nAustralia's pioneers had a grand vision for the railways, to cover a continent, and there are many places where this grand history can be seen. If you are catching the train one way, and travelling by car the other way, you can catch up with some of the interesting railway history you may have missed.\n\nThe Oodnadatta Track basically follows the original alignment of the Ghan before it was moved.  There are sections of track still in place, and you can walk on large sections of the alignment from the road. The Oodnadatta station looks largely unchanged from when it saw its last train service 40 years ago.\n\n\n\n"

A high level observation car is nearest the camera.\n\nCanada is the second largest country on earth, yet with a population of almost 38 million in 2020, it has just the 39th largest population. The sheer size of the country, which spans 9,984,670 km² (3,854,085 sq mi) and six time zones means that vast areas are either sparsely populated or completely uninhabited. This itinerary explains how to book, travel and experience the scheduled passenger rail services that exist between:\n\n* '''Halifax (Nova Scotia)|Halifax (Nova Scotia)'''\n* '''Montreal (Quebec)'''\n* '''Ottawa (Ontario)'''\n* '''Toronto (Ontario)'''\n* '''Winnipeg (Manitoba)'''\n* '''Saskatoon (Saskatchewan)'''\n* '''Edmonton (Alberta)'''\n* '''Jasper (Alberta)'''\n* '''Vancouver (British Columbia)'''\n\nThis itinerary covers 6,351 km (3,946 miles), crosses eight Canadian provinces and passes through some of North America's most vibrant and exciting cities. Whether experienced from the comfort of a private sleeping compartment or in the sociable and affordable seated coaches, it is a once-in-a-lifetime trip that demonstrates Canada's social and geographic diversity, from sea to sea, in line with the motto from Canada's coats of arms, ''A mari usque ad mare''.\n\nThere are many other passenger rail services in Canada. Information on all other rail services in Canada can be found on Rail travel in Canada page.\n\n==Prepare==\n\n===Find time===\nCanada does not have any high-speed railway lines, and much of the infrastructure was built before World War II. In modern times, Canada's railways are primarily used for freight traffic, with passenger services generally given lower priority. The train services listed here are thus not high speed services, but rather are laid back services that primarily cater to tourists with ample time on their hands to enjoy the scenery.\n\n===Whom to travel with===\n\nA handful of private luxury train operators offer exclusive rail tours; however most passenger rail services in Canada are provided by '''[https://www.viarail.ca/ VIA Rail Canada]''', the state-owned Crown Corporation that provides national passenger rail services. '''This itinerary uses only the services of VIA Rail Canada'''.\n\n===Which direction to travel in===\n\nTravelling from one side of Canada to another by train is a great itinerary for an exciting and varied holiday. Travelling both ways is not: the vast landscape of the country will become infinitely less interesting if you have to turn round and go back again. However, the return trip will most likely have different passengers, so you will have a new group of different people to get to know during your voyage.\n\nDecide whether to start your trip in the west (Vancouver) or in the east (Halifax). Check the timetables of the trains you'll be riding on to see how this affects the arrival times in towns and cities you want to stop off in. Many travellers express a preference in going from east to west, since this follows the direction that European settlers populated the country and rewards you after the seemingly endless prairies with the breathtaking Rocky Mountains (Canada)|Rocky Mountains, but the decision of which way to travel is yours.\n\nAdditional side trips by train to other destinations are possible at various points along the transcontinental route. See the Rail travel in Canada page for more information on these other routes.\n\n===When to go===\n\nCanada's train services run throughout the year, although in some cases with reduced frequencies and shorter trains in the low season. Low season (October&amp;ndash;April) fares are lower than in the high season (May&amp;ndash;September) although when travelling during the winter months you should remember that shorter daylight hours will significantly affect your sightseeing opportunities from the train. While summer can be warm and pleasant, winter temperatures in central and eastern Canada plunge well below freezing - sometimes to  or below. A winter train trip can be fun, but you may find it hard to leave the nice warm train when you arrive at intermediate stations.\n\nFor many independent passengers, spring and autumn are the most convenient times to travel, when the climate is comfortable and when low-season fares are available at either end of the high season booking period.\n\n===How to book===\n\n'''VIA Rail Canada''' has an excellent [https://www.viarail.ca/en website] that provides travel information and online ticket sales in several languages. Within North America, you can contact VIA Rail Canada by telephoning  (1-888-VIA-RAIL).\n\n===Tickets and rail passes===\n\nFares in the low season (16 October to 31 May) are less expensive than those in the high season (1 June to 15 October).  Advance booking is recommended for all tickets and passes.  VIA Rail Canada maintains information about its fleet of trains and train cars on its [https://corpo.viarail.ca/en/projects-infrastructure/train-fleet website].\n\n===='Comfort' (coach/economy) class====\n\nImage:Comfort coach class on board VIA Rail Canadas Ocean train.jpg|thumb|'Comfort' coach class on board VIA Rail Canada's 'Ocean' train between Montréal, Québec and Halifax, Nova Scotia,  2006.\n\n'Comfort' class gives you a comfortable reclining seat in an open coach with either one or two seats either side of the aisle. An amenity pack, pillow and blanket are provided, and it is reasonably easy to sleep comfortably during the night. Older passengers or those who might experience discomfort sleeping in a reclining seat may prefer to travel in sleeper class (see below).\n\n====Sleeper classes: Halifax to Montréal====\n\nVIA Rail Canada offer two different classes of sleeper accommodation on the Ocean between Halifax and Montréal throughout the year, with an enhanced sleeper class called 'Easterly Class' during the high season. All services are now operated by modern 'Renaissance' trains, which have replaced the older 'stainless steel' trains used elsewhere in Canada. \n\n* '''Double bedrooms''' have two berths and an en-suite washroom with toilet, handbasin, mirror and power outlet. They are lockable from inside and outside, and can also accommodate a child when two adults are in the two berths.\n* '''Deluxe double bedrooms''' are the same as double bedrooms, but with an en-suite shower.\n* '''Easterly class''' is offered on the Ocean during the high season from early May to the end of October, and is marketed as an enhanced class based on the deluxe double bedroom. Presentations affording cultural and historical insights of the region through which the train passes are offered, and passengers have exclusive access to the lounges and panoramic section of the luxurious Park car. Easterly class tickets include meals in the restaurant car.\n\n====Sleeper classes: Montréal to Toronto====\n\nOvernight sleeper services between Montréal and Toronto have been discontinued. You should travel by day, spending at least one night in Toronto or Montréal before boarding your next train.\n\n====Sleeper classes: Toronto to Vancouver====\n\nThe Canadian is VIA Rail Canada's flagship service, and offers the widest choice of sleeper accommodation on the network. All trains are operated by heavily refurbished 1950s 'stainless steel' trains. All sleeper tickets are marketed as '''Silver and Blue class''' and  access to the luxurious Park Car at the end of the train and include all meals in the restaurant car.\n\n* '''Berths''' are wide facing banquette seats that convert into cosy bunks at night. A curtain that can be fastened shut separates you from the corridor, and toilets and a shower are near-by. Upper and lower berths priced differently, since upper berths are accessed by a small ladder, and require a certain nimbleness. Upper berths also lack a window, so you do not get the view that a lower berth afford you.\n* '''Single Bedrooms''' are one step up from a berth. A wide seat folds down at night to form a bed in a private room, with one either side of the corridor. A sliding door closes off the bedroom from the corridor, and there is a private basin and toilet in the room (the toilet is easily covered and does not detract from the room).\n* '''Double bedrooms''' have two beds arranged one above each other at right angles to the side of the train. Each bedroom features two armchairs, a small closet, fan, electrical outlet, private washroom, sink and mirror. The door locks from the inside and there is a shower down the corridor.\n* '''Triple bedrooms''' are like double bedrooms, but with an additional lower bunk and slightly more room.\n* '''Romance by rail''' is a special package normally taken by honeymooning couples for travel between Toronto and Jasper or Jasper and Vancouver. Two double bedrooms have had their upper bunks and the wall between removed to create a double width room with a double bed.\n* '''[https://www.viarail.ca/en/explore-our-destinations/trains/rockies-and-pacific/toronto-vancouver-canadian/classes-and-services#prestige Prestige Sleeper Class]'''\n\n===What to bring===\n\n'''Sleeper passengers''' should\n\n* pack one or two lightweight bags with all the clothes, toiletries and personal items (including valuables) for their on board cabin\n* pack items and clothing not required during the journey into separate luggage for the baggage car. It is not possible to gain access to the baggage car between your originating and destination stations.\n\nUnlike on board the services of Amtrak in the United States '''Comfort Class (coach) passengers''' on VIA Rail Canada are provided with an amenity kit to make passing the night in coach a cinch. This includes a pillow, blanket, toothbrush, toothpaste, eye mask and ear plugs. However you might like to supplement this with:\n\n* at least one additional inflatable pillow\n* lightweight soft clothes to change into for sleeping\n* your own ear plugs (the better quality the easier it will be to sleep)\n* a small toiletry bag with your personal items\n* wet wipes for easy hygiene\n* bottled water (this can be refilled on the train)\n* snacks, sandwiches, etc. (although these are on sale on board)\n\nAgain, luggage that has been checked into the baggage car cannot be accessed during the journey, so pack a smaller bag with everything you'll need during the trip.\n\n==Get in==\n\nDepending on which side of the country that you start your transcontinental train trip in, see either the Halifax or Vancouver pages for information on getting in.\n\n==Overview of route and trains==\n\n\n\n'''This itinerary presents a journey that travels from east to west''', however it is quite possible and equally enjoyable to make the journey in the opposite direction. The three trains that make up the basic coast-to-coast route are:\n\n* '''[https://www.viarail.ca/en/explore-our-destinations/trains/atlantic-canada/montreal-halifax-ocean The Ocean]''' from Halifax to Montréal\n* '''[https://www.viarail.ca/en/explore-our-destinations/trains/ontario-and-quebec The Corridor]''' from Montréal to Toronto\n* '''[https://www.viarail.ca/en/explore-our-destinations/trains/rockies-and-pacific/toronto-vancouver-canadian The Canadian]''' from Toronto to Vancouver\n\nAs of 2021, schedules are still affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Check the VIA Rail Canada [https://www.viarail.ca/ website] for updates before making travel arrangements.\n\n===The Ocean===\n\n\n[https://www.viarail.ca/en/explore-our-destinations/trains/atlantic-canada/montreal-halifax-ocean The Ocean] departs Halifax three days per week at 1:00PM. The train travels overnight to Montréal, arriving at 10:03AM the following morning. In the other direction, the Ocean departs Montréal at 7:00PM, arriving in Halifax 5:51PM the following afternoon.\n\nBoth east and west bound trains are scheduled to operate over the most scenic parts of the route during the day time, so you will travel through most of Québec along the south shore of the Saint Lawrence river by night. Bear in mind the late night departure or early morning arrival if you want to leave the Ocean at Sainte-Foy for the bus transfer to Quebec City. Perhaps the most scenic part of the route is east of Matapédia, where the line enters the province of New Brunswick and then follows the south shore of the Baie de Chaleurs, offering splendid views across the water to the receding coastline of the Gaspé Peninsula. Heading west, this is in the late evening; heading east, this is in the early morning, and makes for a spectacular distraction to breakfast in the restaurant car.\n\n===The Corridor===\n\n[https://www.viarail.ca/en/explore-our-destinations/trains/ontario-and-quebec The Corridor] is the broad name given to the collection of intercity routes that connect Quebec City, Montréal, Ottawa, Brockville, Kingston (Ontario)|Kingston, Belleville (Ontario)|Belleville, Oshawa, Toronto and other destinations in southern Ontario. There are multiple daily departures on modern trains that carry ''Economy'' class and ''Business'' class. There are no more overnight or sleeper services. Ottawa is served by direct trains from both Montréal and Toronto, but is not on the route of most of the direct services between the two cities. Quebec City is only served by a spur line from Sainte-Foy, so you will need to book a spot on the shuttle and change trains at Sainte-Foy if you are coming from the east. If you are coming from the west, Quebec City is served by direct trains from Ottawa and Montreal.\n\nThe landscapes of southern Quebec and Ontario don't make for a particularly scenic route, but the route is the fastest in Canada and offers a rapid cross section through some of the country's most important industrial manufacturing cities. You'll catch glimpses of Lake Ontario just as you approach or leave Toronto.\n\n===The Canadian===\n\n[https://www.viarail.ca/en/explore-our-destinations/trains/rockies-and-pacific/toronto-vancouver-canadian The Canadian] departs Toronto at 9:45AM on Wednesdays and Sundays, arriving in Vancouver 4 days later at 8AM. It leaves Vancouver at 3PM on Mondays and Fridays, arriving in Toronto 4 days later at 2:30PM. (Schedule as of 29 Apr 2019.)\n\nThe twice-weekly departures of the Canadian are likely to be the most important factor to consider when planning your coast to coast trip. \n\nMany travelers will agree that the Canadian's primary selling point (the vast distance that it covers; 4,466 km or 2,775 miles) can also be its weakness. The train takes more than a day to cross from Toronto to the border with Manitoba, largely covering the distance through a repetitive scenery of lakes and forests. While exceptionally beautiful, this landscape can quickly become boring, so it's a good part of the journey in which to get to know your fellow travelers. Note that the Canadian can on advance notice be stopped at any point along its route between Sudbury (Ontario)|Sudbury and Winnipeg, whether it's at an actual station, named halt, milepost or simply a given number of kilometres from the last city. Canoes, bikes and other equipment can be carried in the luggage car, allowing you to take advantage of northern Ontario's vast landscape for outdoor activities.\n\nAlmost immediately after leaving Ontario, the Canadian enters the prairies and will not leave them until the Rocky Mountains emerge a full twenty four hours later. European travelers in particular might find this part of the trip to be the least beautiful, but possibly the most symbolic part of the trip. The sheer scale of Canada becomes undeniable as the train picks up speed over dead straight stretches of track that cross the bread basket of the country. Small communities and the occasional farm flash past, but it could well be the enormous skies that catch your eye the most.\n\nTraveling across Canada by train from east to west makes the most sense when you first catch sight of the Rocky Mountains. After two days crossing the largely flat and forgettable landscapes of Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, the scale and grandeur of the mountains is incredible to behold. The schedule of the east- and westbound Canadian are designed to ensure that you get the best possible daylight hours for viewing the mountains between Edmonton and Kamloops.\n\n==Itineraries==\n\nCoast to coast, it is possible to make the journey from Halifax to Vancouver on board just three different trains, and in as little as five days traveling. Here are four recommended itineraries, based on the length of time traveling.\n\nCheck the VIA Rail Canada [https://www.viarail.ca/en website] for schedules before making travel arrangements.\n\n===Five days===\n\nFew travellers choose to do this journey straight through, not only because it can be quite hard work in coach class, but because it misses out on the opportunity to experience so many different and exciting cities. However, seasoned travelers who already know Canada well and who have limited vacation time (or just a hankering to ride the train) may relish the sound of this near-non-stop trip.\n\n===Seven days===\n\nIt's possible to combine the basic coast to coast itinerary with one extended layover. Again, this itinerary is probably better suited to those who have already visited Canada before, so the choice of which city to stop off in is largely up to you. Any stop on the route of the Canadian between Toronto and Vancouver would necessitate a stop of at least two, if not three days, because of the frequency of service of the Canadian. This applies in both directions.\n\nTherefore, a seven day itinerary would probably be best expanded on the five day itinerary above by adding extra days in '''just one''' of the following cities:\n\n* '''Halifax'''\n* '''Montréal'''\n* '''Toronto'''\n* '''Vancouver'''\n\nYou can find out more about each one on their respective travel pages. All four offer excellent public transit systems and compact downtown cores that can easily be explored on foot. With just two days, you would be well advised to research ahead, and be realistic about what you expect to see and do in the time that you have.\n\n===Fourteen days===\n\nWith two full weeks, you can reasonably make two or three stops en route. A two-week itinerary is probably the shortest that a first-time visitor to Canada can reasonably manage. The shorter itineraries suggested above are for the serious train fans, since after one or two days on board, you are likely to want a break off the train. . Days when you are not on board a train don't count towards your final total, but that if you depart a city at 8PM one day and arrive at 8AM the next day, you will have used two traveling days.\n\nThere are several options. You can consider a stop in any of the following major cities:\n\n* '''Halifax (Nova Scotia)'''\n* '''Montréal (Quebec)'''\n* '''Ottawa (Ontario)'''\n* '''Toronto (Ontario)'''\n* '''Winnipeg (Manitoba)'''\n* '''Saskatoon (Saskatchewan)'''\n* '''Edmonton (Alberta)'''\n* '''Jasper (Alberta)'''\n* '''Vancouver (British Columbia)'''\n\nFor example, for travellers who want to see more the big cities:\n\n* '''Day one''' in Halifax (all day)\n* '''Day two''' in Halifax (AM); dep. Halifax (midday)\n* '''Day three''' arr. Montréal (AM); in Montréal (PM)\n* '''Day four''' in Montréal (all day)\n* '''Day five''' in Montréal (AM); dep. Montréal / arrive Ottawa (PM)\n* '''Day six''' in Ottawa (AM); depart Ottawa / arrive Toronto (PM)\n* '''Day seven''' in Toronto (all day)\n* '''Day eight''' in Toronto (all day)\n* '''Day nine''' dep. Toronto (AM); on board the Canadian\n* '''Day ten''' on board the Canadian\n* '''Day eleven''' on board the Canadian\n* '''Day twelve''' arr. Vancouver (AM); in Vancouver (PM)\n* '''Day thirteen''' in Vancouver (all day)\n* '''Day fourteen''' in Vancouver (all day)\n\nOr, for travellers who want to see more of Canada's west:\n\n* '''Day one''' in Halifax (AM); dep. Halifax (midday)\n* '''Day two''' arr. Montréal (AM); breakfast in Montréal; depart Montréal / arrive Toronto (PM)\n* '''Day three''' dep. Toronto (AM); on board the Canadian\n* '''Day four''' on board the Canadian; arrive Winnipeg (PM)\n* '''Day five''' in Winnipeg (all day)\n* '''Day six''' in Winnipeg (all day)\n* '''Day seven''' in Winnipeg (AM); dep. Winnipeg (PM)\n* '''Day eight''' on board the Canadian; arrive Jasper (PM)\n* '''Day nine''' in Jasper (all day)\n* '''Day ten''' in Jasper (all day)\n* '''Day eleven''' in Jasper (AM); dep. Jasper (PM)\n* '''Day twelve''' arr. Vancouver (AM); in Vancouver\n* '''Day thirteen''' in Vancouver (all day)\n* '''Day fourteen''' in Vancouver (all day)\n\nAs before, it is recommended to decide what interests you the most and which cities you would like to see, remembering that if you alight from the Canadian (between Toronto and Vancouver) at any stop, you will have to spend two, if not three days there until the next train comes through. An exception to this is possible in Jasper, where you have the choice of two alternative connections to Prince Rupert with VIA Rail Canada and to Vancouver with the Rocky Mountaineer|'''Rocky Mountaineer''' train service.\n\nTravellers who want to visit the western and prairie cities of Canada as part of this two week itinerary may find themselves choosing between:\n\n* '''Winnipeg (Manitoba)'''\n* '''Saskatoon (Saskatchewan)'''\n* '''Edmonton (Alberta)'''\n\nIt is recommended to carefully research your choice, and to consider when and where you will be arriving. Both the east- and west-bound Canadian trains call at Edmonton and Winnipeg during the daytime, but both services arrive at and depart from Saskatoon in the very early hours when you'll be dependent on a taxi and a hostel or hotel that will let you check in during the middle of the night. The Saskatoon rail station is approximately 8 km (5 miles) from downtown. Similarly, the Edmonton station is approximately 6 km from downtown with no public transit between the two. The Winnipeg station is located almost in the heart of downtown.\n\n===One month===\n\nThe basic fourteen-day itineraries above can easily be expanded with longer stopovers in the cities and destinations that interest you the most. \n\n'''Quebec City''' is an excellent destination for rail travellers, and it's close to the route of The Ocean between Montréal and Halifax with transfers available. The basic day required for sightseeing in the nation's capital '''Ottawa''' could easily be extended to two or three allowing time to see the city's impressive museums. Further west, any three of the cities of '''Winnipeg''', '''Saskatoon''' or '''Edmonton''' make great bases from which to explore the vast prairies, although you're likely to need to hire a car if you want to cover any real ground. During the summer months they're also essential stops on the festival tour, as each city puts on their own lively '''Fringe Festival'''. If you want to get off the beaten track (and are prepared to do some serious pre-trip planning) take a detour from Winnipeg on board the government subsidized Hudson Bay train to Churchill, the world capital of polar bears, beluga whales, and various other transient Arctic critters. Beware though: the Hudson Bay runs over tracks that are bedded on the permafrost, so it's a more than 40-hour crawl to the far north and the Hudson Bay.\n\nAnd if you're passing through the Rocky Mountains during the winter months, it would be foolish not to spend anything from a couple of days to a week in Jasper on the slopes.\n\n==Stay safe==\n\n\n\nRail travel in Canada is incredibly safe. The only precautions to take relate to personal belongings and valuables. While it is almost always safe to leave your possessions at your seat while you go to the restaurant or observation car, don't advertise valuable and easily stolen items such as personal music players or computers. To be really safe, check your luggage into the baggage car. Theft from luggage while it is in the care of VIA Rail is unheard of, and you'll be reunited with your bags when you reach your destination.\n\n==Go next== \n\nDepending on which side of the country that you start your transcontinental train trip in, see either the Halifax or Vancouver pages for information on getting out.\n\n\n\n"

It sits above the Niagara Escarpment, and the Bruce Trail passes to the south and east of the community, with the Guelph Trail branching off and passing south of town.\n\n==Understand==\nFrom 1842 until 1986, the town was a major centre for the tanning and leather goods industry. In the early years, it was often referred to as \"Leathertown\".\n\n===History===\n\nIn 1825, the area now known as Acton was settled by the Rev. Ezra, Rev. Zenas, and Rufus Adams. These men were Methodist preachers who took a sabbatical and began farming here on a branch of the Credit River. A fourth brother, Eliphalet, also settled here later. In the 1840s, the community had a grist mill and tannery. The community was named Danville when settler Wheeler Green opened a dry-goods store in 1828. It was later called Adamsville, after the three original settlers.\n\nIn 1856 the Grand Trunk Railway arrived and helped spur growth in the area, especially along Mill Street. By 1869, Acton had businesses that included woodworking mills, tanneries, glove makers and carriage works. Acton's principal trade was in grain, lumber, cordwood, leather and hops. In 1883, postmaster Robert Swan named the village Acton after the area of Acton, London in England.\n\nSignificance of the leather industry\nTanning has been an important industry in Acton since 1842, when the first tannery was established by Abraham Nelles, as the area was attractive to the leather industry because of the large numbers of hemlock spruce trees. These provided the tannin required for a firm, high quality leather of a reddish colour.\n\nThe Beardmore family purchased it in 1865 and ran it for over 50 years. At one time, it was the largest tanner in Canada. The Beardmores also opened tanneries in other parts of southern Ontario. By 1889, their main tanneries in Acton covered 100,000 m². They also built a large brick warehouse that year beside the railway tracks. Hides arrived by rail and were taken for processing by horse-drawn wagons and then shipped by rail to customers.\n\nIn 1969, the business was sold to Frank Heller and Company, who consolidated it into one large building in 1980. The business was closed at times because of bankruptcy and other reasons, but is now in operation. Other specialty tanners and leather products manufacturers were also established in the town.\n\n==Get in==\nActon is at the junction of Highway 7 and Regional Road 25.\n\n[http://www.gotransit.com GO Transit] provides bus and rush-hour rail service between Acton and Toronto.

                    "text": "\n'''Actun Tunichil Muknal''' (often abbreviated as the '''ATM''') is a cave formation in the Cayo region of Belize.\n\n==Understand==\nThe Actun Tunichil Muknal (literally translated as \"Cave of the Stone Sepulcher\") is a relatively recent discovery and can be considered to be more of an eco-tourist destination rather than a traditional caving experience. Guides take great pains to stress the importance of Actun Tunichil Muknal as both a natural formation and a site of historical interest. \n\n===History===\nThe cave was discovered in 1992, and was featured on the National Geographic Explorer film, ''Journey Through the Underworld''. Actun Tunichil Muknal represents one of the most well-preserved examples of pre-classical Mayan culture (around 700 - 900 AD), featuring skeletal remains of human sacrifices and scores of Mayan pottery and other ceremonial objects. Since then, the cave has been completely mapped and explored, covering about 5.3 km (3.3 miles).\n\nThe cave was opened to the public in 2000, and the artifacts within are in the same position as they were when the cave was explored by researchers. These skeletal remains and Mayan objects are properly demarcated by archeologists and the Belize Tourism Board to prevent damage unwittingly caused by tourists.\n\n===Landscape===\n\n===Flora and fauna===\n\n===Climate===\n\n==Get in==\nAlthough the cave is relatively close to San Ignacio (Belize)|San Ignacio, the only road leading out of the town to the site is a bumpy and rural road that crosses a part of the Mopan River. In any case, a guide is required in order to have access to the caves, so taking a package tour with one of the licensed tour companies in San Ignacio would be the best option.   There are also US tour operators who tour the ATM cave. These companies work with local, licensed guides. During Belize's wet season (late June-August), the cave may be flooded and unavailable to travellers. \n\nThe cave is located in the Tapir Mountain Nature Reserve.  To reach the cave, requires an easy 45-minute hike into the jungle. The entrance to the cave is shaped like an hour glass and is flooded with water.  Travelers need to be prepared to get wet, and remain relatively wet to damp during their time in the cave.  The cave system consists of a series of chambers, ending at \"The Cathedral\" where sacrificial ceremonies once took place. Here 14 skeletal remains have been found, and numerous examples of ancient Mayan pottery remain.  It takes roughly 1 1/2 to 2 hours to reach \"The Cathedral,\" so travellers should be prepared to be in the cave for 4 to 6 hours.  Quick-dry clothing is recommended, as most guides will insist on shorts and a shirt, as a sign of respect. This is a very sacred site.  Sandals are not allowed in ATM for safety reasons. Travelers must remove their shoes, and must wear socks while in \"The Cathedral\" to protect the site from oils on the skin. Guides typically carry a dry pack; however, personal items such as cameras are no longer permitted in the cave due to damage caused by a tourist dropping a digital camera on one of the artifacts. In some locations, the only source of light is from helmets (required for entrance) and/or flashlights.  Guides should supply these items.\n\n==See==\n\n==Do==\n\n==Buy==\nThere is no gift store associated with this attraction.\n\n==Eat==\nAs there are no dining establishments within the preserve; most tours will include a packed lunch, and recommend that you bring along a water bottle and snacks.\n\n==Drink==\n\n==Sleep==\n\n===Lodging===\n\n===Camping===\n\n===Backcountry===\n\n==Stay safe==\nAs with any cave tour, the best way to remain safe is to comply with guide instructions and to keep with your group, refraining from exploring areas by yourself. As you get deeper into the cave, there is no natural light, and many areas require traversal through chest-high areas of water, as well as short rock formations to climb to get to the main chambers. At no point should you separate from your guide/group.\n\nAdditionally, because preserving the pristine nature of the cave - both its natural formations and its Mayan artefacts - is so important, following guide directions closely is a must. Help to retain the undisturbed nature of Actun Tunichil Muknal by complying with guide instructions on acceptable behaviour when exploring the cave. Planning is underway to create more clearly delineated paths in order to avoid inadvertent damage to the cave. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Ada Foah, which is also the district capital, is located at the beach and river estuary, and naturally is where most visitors spend their time. \n\n==Understand==\nThe district's coconut palm fringed coastline is 45 kilometers long and provides a living to many people that are employed in fishing and fish processing. However, this coastline is constantly being eroded by the strong tidal waves that are washing away or threatening several villages that are located close to the beach. In order to solve this problem, the construction of a sea defense wall is under way since 2010.\nImage:Ada Volta River.JPG|thumb|350px|At the riverside in Ada Foah\nThe long, sandy beaches are certainly some of the most important tourist attractions. However, there are certain obstacles such as the lack of toilets in the villages close to the beach and the consequence of using the beach as such. Also, garbage – mostly plastic – is piling up at the beach, some of it disposed there, some washed up from the sea by the tide.\n\nApart from the sandy beaches, another natural attraction in the district is the Volta River and its estuary. The Volta River forms the eastern boundary of the district before it reaches the Gulf of Guinea. The islands in the river and in the estuary are a wildlife paradise: marine turtles, birds, crocodiles and monkeys are some of the animals living there. The mangrove vegetation in the salty parts of the estuary is another attraction and an important ecosystem. It is however endangered by human activity along with rare animals that are often hunted down.\n\nThe estuary also offers the best conditions for water sports like sailing, canoeing, fishing, water skiing, wake boarding and jet skiing.\n\nAnother important water body and one of the most important salt mining areas in the country is the Songor Lagoon. Additional to visiting it and learning about salt mining it serves as a base for birdwatchers.\n\n\n\n\n==Talk==\nMost of the inhabitants (85.9 %) belong to the Dangme Tribe. The local language in the Dangme East and West District is Dangme, also called Adangme. It is a Kwa language and is spoken by around 800,000 people in the Dangme East, Dangme West, Volta Region and Togo. They are part of the Ga-Dangbe ancestral lineage. The Dangme speak und understand Ga Language as it is similar to Dangme. English is also spoken by nearly everyone since it is the official language of the country. Many people also speak some Ewe (to communicate with the neighboring people of the Volta Region, Togo and Benin) or Twi.\n\n==Get in==\n\n\nThe best way to get to Ada is by Tro-Tro (small bus), taxi, your own or a rental car. \n\nFrom Accra: there is a regular connection (1½ to 2½ hours, about 120 km) from Tudu Station or from Tema Roundabout. Some Tro-Tros go directly to Ada Foah, with others you have to change in Ada Kasseh. The usual times of operation are between 04:30 and 21:30, but can vary according to the day of the week. \n\nFrom Aflao:take a Tro-Tro in the direction to Accra and get off at Ada Kasseh (3-4 hours, about 80 km).\n\nYou can also get there by ferry from the Volta Region (Anyanui). It only operates on Wednesdays and leaves Anyanui at around 13:00 and 18:00 and takes about 1½ hours. It departs in Ada Foah around 08:00 and 15:00. \n\n==Get around==\nTaxis are readily available, either by car or by motorcycle. Even though motorcycles are not officially allowed to operate as taxis, it is a very common and affordable means of transport. And it can bring you to faraway places that don't seem to be accessible with any vehicle. Just stand at the street and stop a passing one. You can also ask your guesthouse or the Tourist Information Center to book one for you.\n\nThe best way to get around is the ever present Tro-Tro (small bus). It's easy to get around with a reagular connection between Ada Foah and Kasseh (about 20 km). \n\nIf you feel like taking the water route, consider joining the ferry to the market in Anyanui on Wednesdays. This is a very fun way of getting to the other side of the Volta River with a big crowd of locals who bring their products to the market. The ferry leaves Ada Foah around 08:00 and 15:00 and returns from Anyanui around 13:00 and 18:00. It takes about 1½ hours one way. These are only approximate times - in general, the ferry operates similar to the Tro-Tro: it leaves when it's full.\n\nThe Estuary Beach camps are a little harder to reach. The typical way is to grab a motor canoe from virtually any beach on the bayside, with the closest, cheapest option being from the end of the taxi-passable road at the entrance to Azazanyi Village. You can do the sandy 30-minute walk through Azazanyi too, with the most direct (and lightest hassle) route being along the oceanside beach.\n\n==See==\n\n*'''Community zoo'''. Samuel Kabutey Kabo caught his first snake when he built a well some years ago. He went to town to get some supplies and accidentally ran over a cobra with his bike. The snake got very angry and followed him back to his house where it fell into the half-finished well. Samuel's first instinct was to kill the snake, but the Wildlife Division told him that he should keep it and show it to the people to educate them about local animals. That is how the community zoo started. After the Cobra Samuel also caught some pythons and crocodiles that can all be visited at the zoo. \n*'''Crocodile Island'''. There used to be a great number of crocodiles living on one of the islands in the river. But increased human activities drove them away. All that is left nowadays are two or three crocodiles living in a small walled cage on Pediatorkope island. There is no tour to visit them, but any boat operator will take you there if you want or just rent a canoe and paddle there yourself.\n*'''Fetish shrines'''. Shrines are part of daily life in Ghana. The two major shrines in Big Ada were closely connected to Trokosi, or girl child slavery. In this traditional perception, a crime is atoned for when a girl of the offender's family is send to a shrine to serve the gods. This can be for months, but also for many years. Although this practice was legally abolished in 1998, there are still some groups who want to hold on to this tradition. Other opposing groups on the other hand have put much effort into the liberation of the girls and their education and reintegration into society. \nIn Big Ada, Dasume Shrine and Dada Shrine (also called Ogbekpe) can be visited. There is another big one in Goi, one on the island of Alorkpem and one on the other side of the Volta in Anyanui. \n\n*'''Fetish priests'''. Every shrine has its priest who takes care of it and worships the gods in it. So naturally, there is a great number of shrines in the district – most of which can also be visited. Many priests have special healing abilities, do spiritual ceremonies and are consulted for any kind of problem from sicknesses to family problems, unemployment or bad luck. \n*'''Fishing'''. Building traditional fishing boats requires much work and is very expensive. The lower part of the boat is made of one big piece of wood, the upper part of planks. All the boats are then painted in many colors with religious sayings written on it. There are many fishing villages around, the bigger ones being Akplabana and Pute. \n*'''Monkey Island'''. You have to get up early to see the monkeys on so called \"Monkey Island\" in the Volta River. During the day they stay away from the villages and retreat far into the woods, but if you manage to arrive around 06:30 you can watch them from one of the watchtowers that were built for this purpose. \n\n\n\n*'''Old trading fort at the seaside'''. Only few people know where Ada Foah has got its name from. The reason is the fort near the Presbyterian Church that gave the town its name to distinguish the two Adas: Ada Fort, village of the fort. As the sea comes closer more than 1.5 meters each year, it is gradually washing the building that once used to be a prison into the ocean. Half of it is already eroded but hopefully the upcoming construction of the sea defence wall will stop this progress. \n*'''Ostrich Farm'''. If you want to see some really big birds go to Dedukope Ostrich Farm, located close to the border of the Dangme East District. They have some hundred ostriches living in enclosures whose meat is sold to restaurants. You can walk along the enclosures and have a look at the giant eggs. It's a bit difficult to get there, there is no established tour so far and the only information you get is from the watchman or the taxi driver (a small tip is appreciated for the visit). \n*'''Presbyterian church and missionary cemetery'''. When looking at the Presbyterian Church in Ada Foah you will be aware that it is a missionary church built by the first generation of Ghanaian Christians at around 1890. When the European missionaries came to Ghana in the 19th century they faced harsh conditions that they were not adapted to. Many died very young of various tropical diseases. These missionaries were buried at the cemetery next to the Presbyterian Church in Ada Foah. \n*'''Sacred Woods'''. In traditional belief, walking into a sacred wood can turn that person into an animal or he or she might vanish and never return. There are about 20 sacred forests in a near Big Ada which are believed to house deities that are worshiped by people with traditional beliefs. Officially, these forests are only allowed to be entered by people of traditional beliefs and are mostly feared by all others.\n*'''Songor lagoon'''. Visit the Songor Lagoon, the biggest natural salt mining area in Ghana; only about 15 minutes drive from Ada. At this communal salt field you can watch locals at all stages of salt production: from inducing salt water from the ocean into the pans, the crystallization when it dries to washing and packing the salt into bags and loading them unto trucks. Apart from watching the salt mining activities, it is also an excellent place for watching the wintering European birds. The Wildlife Division has put up some observation towers and offers guided tours to the sight.\n\n==Do==\n\n*'''Asafotufiami Festival'''. Historically, the Asafotufiami is a remembrance of ancient wars with neighboring tribes. The \"Asafotu\" are companies of warriors who fire their muskets in celebration. These days, the festival is a grand homecoming for the Ada diaspora. The celebration starts on Thursday in the first week of August and goes on until the following week. The days are filled with celebrations, traditional ceremonies, beach parties, boat races, river excursions and football matches. \n*'''Bird watching'''. The Songor lagoon is an area of international importance as it hosts thousands of migratory European birds wintering in Ghana.  The lagoon provides feeding, breeding and resting ground for over nearly one hundred migrant and local birds. The best time to watch birds is towards the dry season (August to February) – the European winter, and in the early morning or late afternoon. \n*'''Boat race'''. A boat race can be witnessed on the river near the estuary every year in December. Paddle boats for 5 or 15 people compete against each other. Visitors can watch the race and also participate if they register as a group about a week in advance. \n*'''Church'''. The majority of the Ghanaians are Christians and religion is very present in everyday life. Signs of this are many religious shop names such as “God is great” or “Fear God” and the enormous number of churches in every town and village. The majority of people go to church on Sunday and visitors are always welcome to join.\n*'''Funerals'''. Funerals are part of everyday life and it is common to see people walking around in the mourning colors black, white and red on weekends. The celebration follows a strict schedule: On Friday the corpse is brought to the family house accompanied by songs of brass bands and the ceremony starts. On Saturday the corpse is buried accompanied by drumming and music before and after the burial. Throughout the whole ceremony, the sympathizers are expected to make a contribution that is noted precisely. On Sunday, the guests attend a thanksgiving church service in memory of the deceased in case it is a Christian funeral and give thanks. If it is a traditional funeral, the ceremony is continued until the afternoon when the guests depart.\n*'''Monthly Beach Soccer event'''. There is a beach soccer tournament on the first weekend of each month at the seaside near the estuary where teams from different communities in the district compete against each other. Before the start of the tournament the beach is cleaned which is the underlying intention of the whole event.\n*'''Monthly symposium'''. Once a month the ferry that operates between Ada Foah and Anyanui turns into an event location. This unusual venue hosts a monthly symposium that informs both locals and tourists about specific topics concerning health, tradition and education. For the current topics, ticket purchase and the exact dates please contact the Tourist Information Center.\n*'''Sea turtle watching'''. Every year from August to February the Leatherback turtle, Green turtle and Olive Ridley turtle lay their eggs at the seashore. The main nesting areas are the islands/sandspit between the two estuaries and beaches westward of the estuary. Visitors can witness this fascinating sight of the huge turtles coming out of the water and nesting in the sand. Night tours are organized by the Wildlife Division. \n\n==Buy==\n*'''Coffins'''. Ever thought about being buried in a tomato? Or maybe a truck? Although the majority of the Ghanaians are buried in normal ones, there are some carpenters that have specialized in building eccentric coffins. All are made for order and can be any shape you can imagine, from fish, canoes and Tro-Tros to sewing machines, pepperoni, tomatoes and books. The shape of the coffin is always connected to the life or profession of the deceased, so a fisherman would be buried in a fish or canoe, a teacher in a book and a farmer in a tomato.\n*'''Markets'''\nThere is a big market in Kasseh on Tuesdays and Fridays where you can get just about anything you can imagine. From \nAda Foah take the Tro-Tro in the direction of Accra and get off at the market place at Kasseh. A smaller market in Ada Foah on Wednesdays and Saturdays is good for buying fresh vegetables and seafood and some smaller supplies. The Wednesday market in Anyanui is small but less chaotic than the one in Kasseh. You can combine a market visit in Anyanui with a ferry tour. Leave Ada Foah at 08:00 and witness how the sellers already start their business on The ferry. It will return to Ada Foah at around 15:00, always depending on when the ferry is full. \n\n*'''Rum factory'''. Ebenezer from Aflive calls his island the \"rum island\". His sugar cane distillery and the produced \"Igo-gro\" (from \"I go - I grow\") has gained quite some fame and people come from faraway places to stock up on his homemade rum. \n*'''Tailors'''. The rattling of sewing machines can be heard everywhere around the towns and most people have their clothes sewn there instead of buying manufactured clothes. There are sewers for women’s, men’s and children’s clothes and special sewers for school uniforms. So just get yourself some colorful fabric at the market, choose a design from the pictures and order for a custom-made dress or shirt.\n\n===Traditional handicrafts===\n*'''Basket weaving'''. Weaving palm leaves into baskets, rope or mats for sleeping is a widespread local activity. Palm leaves are collected, cut and woven into ropes. Those ropes are used for typing straw mats or any other thing and are very durable. On many islands in the river (especially Aflive and Alorkpem) visitors can watch the women and men weaving and also try it out for themselves. \n*'''Pottery'''. The Vume Pottery Cooperation, located in the Volta Region close to the border to Dangme East draws clients from faraway places to buy it there. Visitors can buy the locally produced vases and pots, watch the men and women work on the potter's wheel and with their hands and try it out themselves. \nImage:Ada Foah Fort.jpg|thumb|270px|Old fort at the seaside in Ada Foah\nImage:Ada sea turtle.JPG|thumb|270px|A sea turtle nesting at the beach in Ada\n\n==Eat==\n\n==Drink==\n\n==Sleep==\n\n==Connect==\n\n==Go next==\n*'''Island Tour''': Join a boat tour on the river around the islands. Visit the rum factory to try some locally produced Akpeteshi, take part in the basket weaving and stop over at the estuary on the way back. You can decide to spend the night in one of the beach camps at the estuary, walk back to Ada Foah through the villages or go back by boat.\n*'''Songor Lagoon''': Visit the salt mining activities at the Songor lagoon and learn how the salt is locally mined and processed.  If you like, you can  join a bird watching tour by the Wildlife Division either before or after the visit. The tours to watch the migratory European birds only take place in the early morning or late afternoon. \n*'''Turtle Tour''': Join a night turtle tour along the beach with the Wildlife Division. You will be walking or driving along the beach searching for sea turtles that come to the shore to nest. It is allowed to come close to watch while they lay and hide their eggs.\n*'''Wildlife Island Tour''': In the early morning, take a boat to the monkey island. If you are lucky, you will spot some of them from one of the watchtowers. After your visit, do a boat cruise along the Volta River and consider a stop-over at the crocodile island.\n*'''Local Tradition Tour''': Do a tour to one of the shrines where you can meet a fetish priest and learn more about traditional religion.  Later, visit one of the sacred groves around the towns and find out about the history. For this tour you should contact the Tourist Information Center that will arrange your visit and tell you about what to keep in mind before visiting these traditional sites.\n*'''Asafotufiami Festival''': Take part in one of the Asafotufiami festival days in August, one of the biggest festivals in the region. There are processions, speeches and celebrations in which you can take part. Check on \"Dates and Events\" about the current dates. \n*'''Old Fort and Fishing Villages Tour''' :Visit the old fort in Ada Foah that is partly washed into the sea and the Presbyterian church with the old missionary cemetery. Then do a tour to one of the fishing villages along the coast and see how they fish with nets, distribute the fish and process it by smoking. \n*'''Local Handicraft Tour''' : Visit the pottery village in Vume and  the coffin makers in Sege. After you had a good look at the handicraft produce or bought something visit the market in Kasseh on your way back. \n*'''Traditional Ceremony Tour''':Start the weekend with a visit of the traditional drumming at the Fetish Priest's shrine in Anyanui on Friday. You can spend the night in the shrine or stay overnight at the Africa Home Lodge in Anyanui. On Saturday and Sunday, visit a funeral and go to a church service. On any other day, you check at the Tourist Information if there are child naming ceremony taking place.\n\n\n\n"

                    "text": "\n'''Adama''' or '''Adaamaa''', formerly known as '''Nazret''', is a large city in Central Ethiopia|central Ethiopia. It is a popular weekend destination for residents of Addis Ababa and hosts many governmental and non-governmental conferences.\n\n==Understand==\nAdama was renamed Nazret or Nazreth after Nazareth, the childhood hometown of Jesus, in the 1940s. Its name reverted to Adama in 2000, but is still also known as Nazareth. It served as the capital of the Oromia region for a few years, until Addis Ababa, also known as Finfinne, became the capital of Oromia again in 2005.\n\nBeing at 1600 m altitude (750 meters lower than Addis Ababa) in the middle of the Rift valley, Adama is significantly warmer than Addis and other parts of Ethiopian highlands. It is also much drier due to the location between two mountain ranges, with many sunny days even in the middle of the rainy season. The resulting climate is quite pleasant, with daytime temperatures of 25 to 30 degrees Celsius and nights at around 15 degrees year round.\n\n==Get in==\nAdama lies approximately 100 km southeast of Addis Ababa, along the main highway that leads to Djibouti via Dire Dawa. If coming from Addis Ababa, it's probably better to ask the best way to go to Adama at the place where you stay, as the buses no longer depart from Le Gare in downtown (like some older guidebooks say), and the main southern/eastern terminal is inconveniently located in Kality suburb 10 km from the downtown (and still far from the southernmost LRT station of the same name) - more than half an hour and 15 birr (2019) by very crowded minivan from the city center, but \"probably at least 300-350 birr\" by taxi. When going from Adama, you're likely to be asked where are you going to in Addis - and some places offered, e.g. Megenagna, are both much closer to the city center and near the LRT station. The trip from the Kality bus terminal to Adama was 50 birr (2019), while the return trip to Megenagna was 60 birr.\n\nThe buses do not follow a strict timetable.  Generally the driver waits for the entire bus to fill with passengers, though usually this means that buses leave at least once an hour (less in case of a minibus). Make sure the bus/minibus you're going to take is \"Express\" - which means it goes non-stop via the (nice) toll road connecting Addis Ababa and Adama. This way, 80 km trip between Addis outskirts and Adama will take just over an hour - but the traffic in Addis could easily double that.\n\nOn arrival to Adama, the minibus will likely stop a few times on the main road offloading some of the passengers, before turning to the right at the town center  - choose the stop nearest to the place/area where you intend to stay, as the bus terminal is a few kilometers away from the center.\n\nThe Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway runs through the city, with daily trains in both directions.\n\n* \n\n==Get around==\n\nStreet names and addresses are not discernibly marked (if, indeed, they are used at all).  The Addis Ababa-Dire Dawa Road is the main thoroughfare through the town, and is pretty walkable by African standards, at least in the city center.  Blue-and-white taxis use fixed routes along major streets, and cost less than one ''birr'' per person, per ride.  These will pick up and let off other passengers along the route.  It is possible to hire a taxi for private use (called \"contract\") for a higher fare, which should be agreed upon in advance.  A horse-drawn cart, or ''gari'', is even cheaper than a public taxi, though by 2010 these had been largely supplanted by auto-rickshaws (called \"Bajaj,\" after their manufacturer). Bajaj drivers do not particularly pester foreigners passing by, but some may try to ask on arrival for more than agreed before (like 100 birr to the bus station instead of 50 - inner-city rides definitely should be even cheaper).\n\n==See==\n\n==Do==\n*Climb the beautiful surrounding mountains including Kechema.\n\n==Buy==\n\n==Eat==\nThe famous \"tibs\", or \"kurt\", raw or roasted beef in the city's famous restaurants specialized in serving roasted beef dishes.\n\nSmall restaurants on the main street are inexpensive (with most expensive meat dishes around 100-120 birr), but often there's neither English menu, nor someone speaking enough English to help a foreigner. Oromo language in menus, unlike Amharic, uses Latin script, but the names are quite different from what you could know from Addis - worth to do some research if you want to try some truly local (or Somalian) delicacies.\n\n==Drink==\n\nSeveral cheap (around 20 birr per mug) bars are available at and near the main road, where you'll see many visitors from Addis enjoying their beer on a weekend.\nA few nicer club-like bars are open till late, but other than that, there's not much of nightlife in town.\n\nAs it is Ethiopia, coffee is also cheap, good and easy to find.\n\n==Sleep==\nMany inexpensive guesthouses are available in the side streets off the main road, quite a lot of them are signposted in English and/or may be found via Google Maps. You may have to walk around a bit if arriving on a weekend, as it's when many people from Addis Ababa come to Adama. The price asked for a clean room with hot shower and old TV in a nice (for a guesthouse) building was 250-300 birr (July 2019).\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Connect==\nMost telephone numbers in Adama use the city code 022 (or simply 22 from outside Ethiopia), though some numbers use 011 (which is the same city code as Addis Ababa).\n\nInternet access is available at most hotels, as well as at various internet cafes. Cheaper guesthouses may or may not have Wi-Fi. As of 2019, internet access in Adama uses ADSL connections which provide a usable but not fast connection. 3G mobile internet is available through Ethiotel. Both types of connection can fail at times.\n\n==Go next==\nAdama is about 25 km north of the spa town Sodere.  Minibuses will take passengers to the entrance of Sodere for a few birr.  While there is a large hotel at Sodere, the resort is perhaps more well-suited for day trips, as accommodations are better in Adama.\n\nMinibuses to the places further east (of which Harar is probably the most interesting for a traveller) are stopping to pick up the passengers at the main road occasionally - choose the correct (southern) side of the road, and look for someone shouting the desired town's name.\n\nTo go to Addis Ababa, it may be better to take a ''bajaj'' to the bus station, as minibuses passing the main road are often already full, and at the bus station it will be easy to choose the destination bus station in Addis, saving time and/or money on local transportation there.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It consists of mountainous and sparsely populated terrain, divided into the savannah north and jungle south. The Muslim Fulbe (Fulani) form the major ethnic group, though Tikar, Gbaya, and other peoples are present in lesser numbers.\n\nThe Adamawa's economy is based almost entirely on one thing: cattle, a Fulbe monopoly. The region's low population, high humidity, and vast fields of grass make it ideal for grazing. Herdsmen rotate pastures, and they often construct watering holes or wells for themselves and their animals.\n\nNearly all farming in the province is done at the sustenance level. Millet is the mainstay, though maize, and manioc are also important. Other crops, grown in smaller quantities, include cocoyams, yams, and groundnuts. The Gbaya, Mbum, and Dourou are the region's most prolific farmers, though even the herdsmen farm in the rainy season.\n\n==Get in==\nNgaoundéré is the gateway to the province, and it is most easily accessible from southern Cameroon via the \"Transcam II\" rail line. The trip takes between 12 and 30 hours, but the presence of couchettes makes the journey bearable for those who can afford them. Other passengers are crammed into all available seats, however, including those in the dining car. Due to the overcrowded conditions, thieves are another hazard.\n\nRoad travel from the south is also possible, but this is limited to poor roads from the Centre Province or else a long detour through the East Province, where the roads are not much better. Roads within the Adamawa are mostly unpaved and are often in poor condition (particularly south of Ngaoundéré) due to little maintenance. The road north from Ngaoundéré into the North Province is paved, however, meaning that those travelling via train can continue to the North and Far North without too much discomfort. National Road 6 enters the province from Foumban in the West Province and continues on to Banyo, Tibati, and Meïganga. National Road 15 comes from Sangbé in the Centre Province to Tibati and on to Ngaoundéré.\n\nA regional airport services Ngaoundéré with flights to Yaoundé, Douala, Garoua, and Maroua. Tignère, Banyo, Ngaoundal, Tibati, and the Mbakaou Reservoir all have airstrips.\n\n==Get around==\n\n==See==\nMost travellers see the Adamawa only briefly as they transition at Ngaoundéré from the train to a bus further north. The province does see some visitors who are interested in the region's rich cultural history. A number of lamidos allow tourists to visit their palaces, for example, such as the ruler of Ngo, who receives nobles every Friday and Sunday. The province also has numerous scenic destinations ranging from crater lakes to caves and waterfalls.\n\n* \n* \n\n* '''Lamidat de Ngaoundere''', local history museum.\n\n* '''Mont Ngaoundere''', tourist attraction with mountain that can be used in hiking.\n\n==Do==\n\n* '''Terrain Bitcou''', soccer field.\n\n* '''Alliance Franco Camerounaise de l'Adamaoua''',  recreation center.\n\n==Eat==\n\n* '''Super Kilichi'''.\n\n* '''Terre Promise'''.\n\n* '''Chez Saadjo''', African dish restaurant.\n\n==Drink==\n\n* '''Sofitel Bar'''.\n\n* '''Gadourou Bar'''.\n\n* '''Le Rocher'''.\n\n* '''Transcam Hotel'''.\n\n==Stay safe==\n\n==Go next==\n\n\n\n\n"

                    "text": "\n'''Adana''' is a city on the Cilician Plains of central Turkey, on the Seyhan River about 50 km from the Mediterranean coast. It's industrial and mostly modern but with several places of interest in its historic centre. In 2021 the metropolis had a population of 2,263,373. \n\n== Understand ==\n\nAdana has been inhabited for over 8000 years. The name may drive from a proto-European word ''danu'', \"on the river\", making it an unlikely cousin of the Danube, Dnieper and Doncaster. People known to settle here include the Luwians, Hittites, Sea People, Assyrians, Cilicians, Persians, Selucids, Armenians and Romans - these built the stone bridge (Taşköprü) over the river. Adana changed hands many times after the break-up of the Roman-Byzantine Empire but came under Ottoman control from 1517. In early modern times it developed a cotton industry and had a polyglot population of Muslims, Armenians, Greeks, Syrians and Arabs. But inter-ethnic tensions played into resentment of industrial labour conditions, and the Armenians suffered a massacre in 1908 then genocide in 1915.\n\nThe cotton trade has slumped but the economy of Adana remains based on agriculture, plus mixed industries including automobiles, and banking. It nowadays has four districts: Seyhan is the historic core, with the sites of traveller interest. Çukurova, often called \"New Adana\", is a residential area north along the lake shore. Yüreğir east of the river is industrial and low-rent residential. Sarıçam lies northeast and has the university. A fifth, nominally part of Sarıçam, is İncirlik, where the NATO air base is springboard for operations deeper into Asia. This effort has brought an influx of westerners into Adana, and the town has business hotels and other western-style amenities out of proportion to its size.\n\nAdana lost about 450 of its citizens in a dozen collapsed buildings (mostly high-rise residentials) during a series of powerful earthquakes in early 2023. The local damage was incomparably lighter than that suffered by its eastern neighbours closer to the epicentre.\n\n== Get in ==\n\n\n=== By plane===\n\n | url=https://www.dhmi.gov.tr/Sayfalar/Havalimani/Adana/AnaSayfa.aspx | email=\n| address=Barış Blv | lat= | long= | directions=\n| phone=+90 322 435 0380 | tollfree= | hours= | price=\n| wikidata=Q1430728\n| lastedit=2023-01-10\n| content=There are few international flights, but frequent flights from Istanbul (both IST and SAW), Ankara and Izmir. Other Turkish cities with a daily flight are Antalya, Trabzon and Van. There's car hire in the terminal from a couple of companies. \n}}\n\nThe airport is only 4 km west of town, with taxis and dolmuşes to the centre. Bus 135 runs every 30 min to the old centre (15 min), railway station and northwest suburbs. Bus 125 runs hourly past old centre (get off at Sefa Ölzer Cd) to the hospital campus. Buy tickets on board for both. The direct bus to Tarsus and Mersin is axed. \n\n=== By bus ===\n\nBuses from Istanbul run every couple of hours and take 13 hours via Ankara and Niğde, for a fare in 2023 of 350 TL. \n\nThree buses a day take 5 hours from Konya. Two per day wind over the mountains from Antalya via Alanya, Taşucu (for Cyprus summer ferry), Silifke, Mersin and Tarsus. \n\nOne bus a day runs all the way from Van near the border with Iran, via Tatvan, Bitlis, Batman, Diyarbakır, Sanliurfa, Gaziantep and Osmaniye. \n\nBus operators on these routes are [https://www.metroturizm.com.tr/ Metro Turizm] and Flixbus.\n\n the bus terminal is 4 km west of town on D-400; it's average-tatty. Taxis and minibuses will take you downtown.\n\n=== By train ===\n\n\n\nYou can reach Adana same day from Istanbul or Ankara by taking the YHT high-speed train to Konya. Change there for the daily ''Toros Ekspresi'', taking six hours via Karaman to reach Adana for 22:00. The return train leaves Adana before 08:00 and likewise connects at Konya with YHT trains to Istanbul and Ankara. The Karaman-Adana line is being upgraded for high-speed trains so disruptions may occur until this is complete (maybe by 2025) but in 2023 it's running normally.\n\nThere's also slower mainline trains such as ''Erciyes Ekspresi'' that runs daily from Kayseri, taking six hours via Niğde, and ''Fırat Ekspresi'' which runs daily from Elazığ, taking 13 hours via Malatya and Osmaniye. Finally there's an hourly regional train from Mersin (for ferries from Northern Cyprus) taking 90 min via Tarsus. Three trains per day continue to Iskenderun, taking 3 hours via Osmaniye. \n\nOther routes are a tale of woe. The ''Cukurova Express'' sleeper from Ankara and trains from Gaziantep has been suspended for years or due to construction works. Former international routes from Syria and Iraq are closed indefinitely.\n\n* \n\n=== By road ===\nFrom Ankara it's 500 km, say 5 hours, following O-21 motorway south then O-51 east. In 2022 the tolls totalled 163 TL.\n\nO-52 runs east to Osmaniye, Gaziantep, Sanliurfa and Mardin by the Syrian border.

There is a regular flight from Las Palmas, Gran Canaria with CanaryFly, though only seasonal.\n}}\n\n===By bus===\nThere are a few buses daily from as far away as Casablanca and Marrakech. Buses are run by CTM, Supratours and Satas. There are no regional operators.\n\nSupratours and CTM buses run to and from Agadir (~20 hr, ~350 dirham). Supratours has two buses per day, while CTM has one. From Laayoune, costs are 230 dirham per person (2023). Be prepared for up to eight checkpoints along the way and, if a Westerner, to be checked thoroughly.\n\n===By car===\n'''National Route 1''', running the length, of the country passes by Dakhla It is also the only major road in the vicinity. Distance from the nearest major city in the north, El Aaiun is 535 km. This road is in good condition but expect long distances between gas stations.\n\nTo the south of Dakhla is 440 km of almost uninhabited territory, except for a few tiny fishing villages, until the Mauritanian border and Nouadhibou. Travelling this stretch by car is perfectly possible but requires some planning and careful preparations. There are only two gas stations along the entire route and breakdown could include hours of wait in scoring temperatures.\n\n==Get around==\nThe city centre is small enough to navigate on foot. Should you want to head further out, petits taxis abound and are metered.\n\n==See==\n\n\n\n\n* Take a road trip to Aoussard: UN base, followed by mine field, followed by Moroccan army base. Take water with you and fill up with gas: it's a 3-hour drive (if you obey speed limits) and it gets hotter with each kilometre. \n* Take a break at the laguna and watch kite-surfers. They even have a special road sign that says \"watch out for kite surfers that sometimes crash on the road\". \n* Drive to the historic lighthouse west of Ad-Dakhla: albeit as of January 2014 climbing it was no longer permitted, the building continues to be one of the most recognisable landmarks of Western Sahara due to the black-and-white ring pattern.\n* \n\n==Do==\n\nThere are windsurfing and quad driving opportunities north of Dakhla. Inquire locally. A kite shop next to the Supratours office at the waterfront is helpful with all the necessary info. You can wind and kitesurf on both the western (ocean) and eastern (lagoon) side of the peninsula.\n\nYou will hardly see anyone around during daytime, but don't worry, Dakhla, like most other cities in the area, comes to life after sunset.\n\n\n\n==Buy==\n\n==Eat==\nMany patisseries offer cheap pastry. The restaurant at Sahara Regency hotel has decent European food, though the choice is limited and it is not always fresh. There are also numerous eateries in town.\n\n==Drink==\n\n==Sleep==\nThere are plenty of budget hotels clustered around the city centre. Due to military presence, most only have twin rooms and you will pay almost the same price if you are alone. Twin rooms usually cost 150 dirham (2023). Prices, as always, are negotiable.\n\nThere are a few campsites by the road to the north of Dakhla. Camping Moussafir is a popular spot with overlanders, and is located just south of the first checkpoint out of town.\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n==Go next==\n===North===\nTicket for any bus heading north can be bought at the corresponding agency, they all have offices around the town centre (Satas is a bit further south).\n\n===South===\nSupratours runs a bus south to the Mauritania border. The bus leaves from the waterfront office at 08:00 and costs 160 dirham, arriving at the frontier at 13:00. It returns to Dakhla at 15:00, arriving Dakhla at 20:30.\n\nFinding a lift is usually not a problem. You can try to get a lift from overlanders (ask around at Camping Moussafir) or catch a ride with the Mauritanian traders, who gather on a lot opposite from the first police checkpoint north of Dakhla (take a petit taxi to get there for about 15-20 dirham, or walk the 7&amp;nbsp;km). The going rate is 250 dirham for a ''car'' (a minivan) or 350 dirham for a Mercedes. The cars leave in the morning.\n\nYou can also organize your ride to Nouadhibou (350-400 dirham, ~10 hours including border crossing) or Nouakchott (600 dirham, min. 12 hr) at Hotel Sahara in the centre. Ask for Tawfiq. The cars leave around 07:00.\n\nBe prepared to spend several hours on both sides of the border.\n\n\n\n\n"

                    "text": "\n'''Addis Ababa''' (Amharic phrasebook|Amharic: አዲስ አበባ) is the capital and largest city of Ethiopia. It had an estimated population of almost 4 million in 2023 and it is growing very rapidly like many African cities. The city is an important center of diplomacy, and despite being a relatively young city, Addis is a good introduction to Ethiopia and its culture.\n\n==Understand==\n\n\nWhile Ethiopia is regarded as the original home of humans, and there has been several earlier settlements in the region, Addis Ababa was founded only in 1886 by King Menelik II and Queen consort Taytu Betul. Since that, Ethiopia has went through a lot of events that have left a mark on the city, such as two cathedrals built to commemorate victories over Italians, sites where emperors lived and worked, monuments to them, and a memorial museum to the victims of the red terror during the Derg regime. The museums of the city lets visitors experience much older times too – indeed you can see a replica of the hominoid Lucy at the national museum. In addition, the restaurants and cafés of the city let you sample Ethiopian cuisine, its famous coffee and the national drink tej.\n\nThere are more than 120 international missions and embassies in Addis Ababa, making the city a hub for international diplomacy concerning Africa. The headquarters of the African Union and the [http://www.uneca.org UN Economic Commission for Africa] (UNECA) are both in the city. The European Union and the United States both have two delegations in Addis Ababa, one for bilateral relations with Ethiopia and one for the African Union.\n\nThe city is divided into ten boroughs, known as subcities, then further divided into wards (''kebeles''). Suburbs include Shiro Meda and Entoto in the north, Urael and Bole (home to Bole International Airport) in the east, Nifas Silk in the south-east, Mekanisa in the south, and Keraniyo and Kolfe in the west. Many of the wealthiest people live in the southeast (Bole), southwest (old airport), CMC, Ayat and Lamberet parts of town. The city is one of the first in Sub-Saharan Africa to have rail based public transit. The light rail system built with Chinese help is often credited with a rapid change of connected parts of the city.\n\n===Climate===\n\nAddis Ababa features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb), a variety of the temperate oceanic climate, with wet summer (comparable to Mexico City). The average highs are between  and , the average lows between  and . The warmest months are February to May, but not \"hot\" as people imagine Africa; most hotels do not have air-conditioning. Temperatures and climate can vary due to elevation. Addis Ababa has 132 rainy days per year and records  of rainfalls annually.\n\nTemperatures in Addis Ababa are remarkably constant from month to month: the annual temperature variation is low with around .  However, due to its altitude of , the diurnal temperature variation is high with around  difference between day and night in average. It is often  at lunchtime and  at night; always take a second layer with you during the evening.\n\n====Seasons====\nThe dry winter season is from October to March. Nighttime lows can drop below +10°C, but daytime highs are comparable to the following summer months. The warm summer season around April and May is almost unnoticeable in Addis Ababa (more visible in other parts of Ethiopia), though the nights are warmer and the likelihood of rain increases.\n\nThe monsoon season is from June to September. Even if temperatures are similar to other months, July and August appear colder and less comfortable due to 80% relative humidity, few hours of sunshine and daily rains: tonsillitis and common cold are frequent. Rains also cause mud and make dirt-roads soapy. Floods happens on roads, creating traffic jams, notably at the beginning of the rainy season (end-June), when the water drainage pipes are corked by dust and wastes accumulated during 8 months of dry season. \n\nThunderstorms (short but with heavy rains) are frequent and isolated. For instance, it is not uncommon to go to another area of the city for a 2-hour lunch in Bole and discover wet roads when coming back to Arada. In August, it is also possible to experience some hail.\n&lt;br clear=\"right\" /&gt;\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By plane===\n\n () is the busiest airport in East Africa. It is the main hub for [https://www.ethiopianairlines.com Ethiopian Airlines]. \n\nThere are two terminals. Terminal 1 (the older, smaller one) is for all domestic flights and most flights to cities in neighbouring nations (Djibouti, Nairobi, Khartoum, etc.). Terminal 2 (the newer 2003 building) is for all other international flights of Ethiopian Airlines and most other companies (arrangements may change so check first). Terminal 2 is said to be the largest terminal in sub-Saharan Africa. There are ATMs accepting Visa and Mastercard and forex services taking a wide range of currencies.\n\nThere are [https://www.ethiopianairlines.com/ao/contacts several Ethiopian ticket offices in Addis]; including the main one at Churchill Road near the Ethiopian National Theatre and another one in the Hilton Hotel.\n\n===By car===\nMost of the major roads are in good condition:\n* From Asmara and Dese: Highway 1\n* From Axum and Bahir Dar: Highway 3\n* From Djibouti and Nazret (Adama): Highway 4\n* From Gambela National Park and Gambela: Highway 5\n* From Jimma and Giyon: Highway 6\n\nTrans-African Highway 4 from Cairo and Bahir Dar passes through Addis Ababa en route to Nairobi and Cape Town.\n\n===By bus===\n====Terminals====\n* \n* \n* \n\n=== By train ===\nImage:Bahnstrecke Addis Abeba–Dschibuti.png|thumb|Map of the [[w:Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway|Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway]]\n\nThe [https://edr.gov.et/ railway line] connecting Addis Ababa with the port city of Djibouti_(city)|Djibouti, via Dire Dawa opened in 2016/17. Journey time is about 6.5 hours from  Dire Dawa, a mandatory overnight stay and another 12 hours to Addis and as of 2024 there is a train every second day. Tickets can be bought at the railway station or at a ticket office next to the old colonial ''Legehar'' station (a portmanteau of the French name for station, la gare) on Churchill Ave.\n\n*  south of the city center, far away from anything. Taking a taxi is the best option, expect up to 45 minutes for a trip to the central city.\n}}\n\n==Get around==\nVery few streets have names and those that do may not be named correctly on a map; use landmarks to navigate the city.\n\n===By bus===\n&lt;!-- \nMore than 10 years old prices, they're almost certainly (much?) higher now\n--&gt;\n\n'''Blue and white minibuses'''\n\nBlue and white minibuses/taxis travel quite efficiently around town. Since they are full with people most of the time, it is very cheap too; usually between a few birr depending on how far you are going. To catch a minibus, stand on the side of the road and hail it. This can be done anywhere it is possible for the bus to stop. The conductor inside will call out the destination, and if that's where you want to go: get on. You pay the conductor when he signals to you that he wants money (which might take a few minutes). To get change. To get out say \"woraj alle\", or just \"woraj\". It is worth having an Ethiopian guide with you if it is your first time using these taxis, since it can be quite chaotic to find out what minibuses go where, and from what places.\n\n'''Orange/yellow public buses'''\n\nThese buses connect the whole city for a fare of 0.5–3&amp;nbsp;birr (2016). There are no schedules or maps available, however if you wait on a major street where a crowd gathers you can ask other people or the cashier – which is always in a cabin at the back door – for your destination. Line 31 for example is a convenient line from Meskel Square to the National Museum or Trinity Church. The buses are often overcrowded, so watch your belongings\n\n===By taxi===\n&lt;!--\nMore than 10 years old prices, they're almost certainly (much?) higher now\n--&gt;\n\n\nUber does not operate here yet, but there are a few alternatives. Zayrides is one that has worked, albeit somewhat more wonkily. It's often easier to find a cab on the street, unless you're somewhere inside a restaurant or hotel until the driver arrives. They will typically call you when they accept the ride to confirm your location and then again when they arrive. The car's location in the app will often not update.\n\n'''Small blue Lada taxis'''\n\nSmall blue Lada taxis are more expensive. Negotiation is the norm and you often have to press quite hard to get a bargain as a foreigner. They can be contracted for a single trip, an hour, or a full day; just negotiate. Do not be surprised if the price of the taxi increases at night for the same trip. For example the trip Piazza-Bole Airport can be as low as 100&amp;nbsp;birr at day, but rises to 150 after dark (2016).\n\n'''Yellow taxis'''\n\nYellow and green taxis usually hang around hotels like Sheraton. They are more expensive, but reliable. If you're willing to pay for peace of mind, slightly better drivers and a car that wasn't featured in the Flintstones, use these cars.\n\n===By light rail===\n\n\nThe Chinese built a system of light rail lines (one of the first in sub-Saharan Africa) in the 2010s. There are two lines that cross near Meskel&amp;nbsp;square:\n* West–East green line 1 is from ''Tor Hailoch'' station to ''Ayat''.\n* North–South blue line 2 is from ''Kality'' station to ''Menelik&amp;nbsp;II&amp;nbsp;Square'' station (aka ''Piazza'').\nCost is 2&amp;nbsp;birr for an 8-station trip and up to 6&amp;nbsp;birr to go everywhere. Development along light rail stations is going on at breakneck pace and many former slums have been replaced by relatively upscale housing businesses and retail.\n\nDuring peak hours the light rail is so crowded as to be almost dangerous.  Pickpockets are common, and riders are not used to the concept of letting people off before they get on. As a result, you may need to physically shove passengers out of your way to get off the train – if not, it may be several stops until you can get off!\n\n==Talk==\n\nAmharic phrasebook|Amharic is spoken by the majority of the population, with other languages (namely Oromo and Gurange) spoken by a minority. For all intents and purposes, learning basic Amharic words and phrases will be enough for any trip, as it is unlikely you will encounter anyone who doesn't speak some Amharic.\n\nIncreasing numbers of young people can speak English, especially those who are more affluent. Be aware that Ethiopians usually speak English with a heavy accent, which can be difficult for an American or British person to understand. In the city centre, most people you encounter will speak English fluently. However, if you venture into residential neighborhoods, especially poor areas, you may find that hardly anyone can speak English well.\n\n==See==\n\n\n\nIf you walk along the road from Meskel Square to Sidest Kilo, you'll probably find it quite entertaining and interesting. You'll see the Africa Hall, the palaces and the Parliament building, the Hilton Hotel, the marvellous architectural adventure of a building hosting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Sheraton Hotel, the first modern school (which Emperor Menelik II built in the 1880s), the Trinity Orthodox cathedral, the National Museum, and the Addis Ababa University (which hosts a former palace and museum).\n\nArat Kilo Avenue is marked by a statue built in commemoration of the Ethiopian day of victory during the Second World War, while Sidest Kilo Avenue is marked by a statue commemorating some 39,000 residents of Addis Ababa killed by Italian fascist troops. Around Arat Kilo, you will find part of an old town known as Serategna Sefer (literally, the residential area of labourers).\n\nIf you go past Sidest Kilo, the road becomes steeper and many of the attractions will be on the right side of the road. The Entoto college (previously Teferi Mekonnen School) and the US Embassy are on this side of the street. After the Embassy there's an open market called Shiro Meda where traditional craftsmen sell their homemade fabrics, pots and other craftwork. The marketplace is at the foot of the Entoto Mountains, which rise up to 3,300&amp;nbsp;m (10,827&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level.\n\nYou can take a taxi or a bus to the mountain unless you are of a mind to try it yourself. On the mountain, you will find the first churches of Addis Ababa, called Saint Mary and Saint Raguel, and a smaller palace of Menelik II. Walking the mountain, especially between the churches, is refreshing and gives the chance to see rural life, the city, forest and unbelievably beautiful landscape intersected by farmlands and farmers trails. It is from here that Menelik II and Queen Taitu conceived the establishment of Addis Ababa. You can get a sense of the city plan by viewing the city from here.\n\n===Museums===\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Churches and mosques===\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n* \n* \n* \n\n===Other===\n* \n* \n* \n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Do==\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \nStop by at one of the small (5-7 people) coffee spots / rooms to taste local coffee with tenadam (rue) and have a conversation with locals who hang out there. You can find many of those along the main streets. Price should not be more than 5 birr. Oftentimes you can have local food there too.\n\n==Learn==\n\n'''Addis Ababa University''' is the largest and the oldest university in Ethiopia. It was originally named \"University College of Addis Ababa\" at its founding, then renamed for the former Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie I in 1962, receiving its current name in 1975. Although the university has six of its seven campuses within Addis Ababa (the seventh is located in Bishoftu, about 45&amp;nbsp;kilometres away), it also maintains branches in many cities throughout Ethiopia, leading to the claim of being \"the largest university in Africa.\"\n\nThe government assigns qualified students to these universities upon completion of secondary school. Students also attend other private colleges, such as '''Unity College'''. Addis Ababa University was founded in 1950 at the request of Haile Selassie by a Canadian Jesuit, Dr Lucien Matte as a two-year college, and began operations the next year. Over the following two years an affiliation with the '''University of London''' was developed.\n\nThere is also '''Theological College of the Holy Trinity''', a theological school of higher education located in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It provides religious and secular education to both clergy and lay members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, as well seeking to be a centre of theological and ecclesiastical study for all '''Oriental Orthodox Churches''' as well.\n\nFounded as a high school by Emperor Haile Selassie in 1942, the college division was added in 5 October 1960, and the elementary education section eliminated on 18 December 1961 and the college became one of the chartered units of this first National University of Ethiopia.\n\n==Work==\n\n* There is a high demand for IT professionals.\n* Many start-up companies search for individuals with computer networking and consulting background.\n* Addis Ababa has the highest number of NGOs in Africa, and possibly in the entire Third World. They are well known for paying good salaries for their employees.\n* The unemployment rate in Addis is low according to the Nazret.com (8% of the population in Addis Abeba were unemployed in 2008).\n* Many expatriates work in NGOs and small start-up IT companies.\n* Compared to other African cities, Addis Ababa has a high number of big, medium and small computer training schools, governmental and private learning institutions. Many students who attend there hope to land an IT or consulting job in the city's very tight job market.\n\n==Buy==\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* , with numerous jewellery.\n}}\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n* \n* \n===Get money===\nEthiopia traditionally operates a cash economy, however acceptance of cards is increasing.  Credit cards are now accepted in most hotels, restaurants and shops.  Cash is preferred if the amount is small and there is no guarantee the card machine will be working.\n\n'''ATMs/cash machines''' are found throughout Addis Ababa. '''Dashen Bank''' is a principal member of both VISA and MasterCard International and has ATMs.  Commercial Bank has ATMs that accept international cards and does not charge a fee. Not all cards are accepted everywhere, Dashen Bank ATMs accept Visa, MasterCard, Cirrus and Plus, while Zemen bank ATMs do not accept MasterCard. Most ATM machines have a 4,000–6,000&amp;nbsp;birr limit per day, but most do not charge a local ATM fee (international or third-party ATM fees from your financial institution may apply).\n\n'''Warning:''' Some ATM machines are targeted for \"skimmer\" scams, allowing thieves to steal your ATM card information. To protect yourself, the safest ATMs to use are the ones located at the Hilton (Dashen, Zemen, CBE); Radisson Blu (Dashen, Zemen, Wegagen); or Sheraton (Dashen) hotels.\n\nThere is an illegal black market where you can get a slightly better rate, especially if you bargain. Check your money very carefully before you leave and do not allow it to leave your hand after your final count. Most souvenir shops off Churchill Rd and Zambia St do it.\n\n==Eat==\nFood is generally cheap. Make sure you try the national dish ''injera'' at least once, since there is no other food like it. It is a yeast-risen flat bread with a unique, slightly spongy texture. It is traditionally made out of teff flour. In making injera, teff flour is mixed with water and allowed to ferment for several days, as with sourdough starter. As a result of this process, injera has a mildly sour taste. It's what the locals eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Most ordinary Ethiopian restaurants have it, and a serving for 2 people with free refills can be as cheap as 15&amp;nbsp;birr.\n\n===Budget===\n\nAddis has hundreds of cake and coffee cafes. They sell various coffees, tea - black unless you ask for \"machiatto\" - and sometimes fruit juices. There are also juice beits. The cafes along Bole Road and around the Piassa area are of a high standard and relatively inexpensive. Most are very similar to each other.\n\nMost cafes serve the common drink called 'sprice juice' (fruit pulp served in layers in a glass). There are usually three layers from a selection of avocado, mango, papaya, banana, guava etc. The juice is eaten with a spoon. It is colourful and tastes delicious. Single fruit juices are also great, such as orange, papaya, mango, and pineapple - beautifully fresh. 7&amp;nbsp;birr up to 25&amp;nbsp;birr in Hilton.\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n* \nRestaurants that do not have an English menu are cheaper. Example: Connection between Bole Road and Tele-Bole, next to Bole roundabout, at NOC-Fuelstation, close to '''German Kantine'''. You can have lunch (local food, spaghetti) for less than 20&amp;nbsp;birr. If you don't have a translator, ordering is a lot of fun.\n\n===Mid-range===\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Splurge===\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Drink==\n\nThe national drink of Ethiopia is 'tej', which is brewed from honey. You can also try 'tela' which is similar to beer.\n\nIn addition to places listed below, some of the hotels in Sleep have a bar. \n\n* \n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Sleep==\n\n===Budget===\nAs of 2020, it is still possible to find \"rooms\" for 300-1000 &amp;nbsp;birr, most of them have running hot water.\n* \n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n&lt;!--\n*  --&gt;\n\n===Mid-range===\n\n&lt;!--\n*  --&gt;\n* \n&lt;!--\n* \n*  --&gt;\n* \n* \n* \n&lt;!--\n* \n*  --&gt;\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Splurge===\n\n* \n* \n&lt;!--\n*  --&gt;\n* \n* \n* \n* \n*\n* \n\n==Stay safe==\n\n* Addis is safer than most cities in Africa. Gang violence and similar serious activities are unusual. However, you may encounter some '''pickpockets|pick-pockets''' and '''Common scams|con-artists''' around and inside Bole Airport, Mercato, Piazza and many other areas. Keep your belongings close, and pay attention to your surroundings. A common tactic is to show you a tray of things to buy with one hand and to try your pocket with the other. The good news is most of these pick-pockets are unarmed and young boys. If they know that you are aware of what they are up to, they may get intimidated and go away. However, some can be quite persistent and even involve older boys.\n*Watch out for the spitting scam which happens in Piazza area. Typically it involves someone \"accidentally\" spitting on you, offering a handkerchief / tissue to clean it up, trying your pockets while you are distracted by this \"accident\" and then jumping into a companion's car with your belongings.\n*Someone might also grab your arm and act crazy pretending to kick you as a distraction while his accomplice tries your pockets.\n* As most Ethiopians are very welcoming, there is an infamous scam where young locals \"befriend\" tourists and invite them over after a nice day together to celebrate a \"special holiday\". You will get fed a lot of khat leaves, a chewing drug, and have a good time with them, but in the end you will be asked for a tremendous amount of money for the khat as they claim it is a \"special\" quality.  Be aware of too friendly locals and ask if there is a price to anything, even if they claim you are invited.\n* Be aware of your belongings on Line Taxis: They usually get very crowded – keep your wallet/phone/bag close to you.\n* The major and important roads and areas are patrolled by the 'Federal Police' or, as the city residents refer them ''Federal''. They have a reputation of being merciless with suspected criminals. In contrast, the Addis-Ababa city police, who most of the time patrol the less important city streets, markets and neighborhoods are more tolerant and less respected police officers.\n* For all emergencies . In Addis, major streets are generally safe at night.\n* Unlike in other African cities, in Addis-Ababa, police officers ''never'' approach foreigners to ask them to present a passport, ID or \"legal\" papers. Once you show your passport at the airport, you are free to move around pretty much anywhere. The only time you need your passport or ID is for hotel reservation and other similar and few instances. However, it is important to have your ID with you at all times.\n\n==Cope==\n'''Watch what you drink''' or you can fall '''sick'''. It is important to remember to only drink bottled water. There are many brands to choose from; '''always''' check the plastic seal on all bottles before paying any vendor. Visitors are warned against eating vegetables such as those in salads that may have been washed in water. Try limiting fruits and vegetables to those you peel yourself such as oranges, mangos, etc.\n\n'''Pollution'''. Addis Ababa is badly polluted because of badly maintained diesel vehicles and dust.  If you have any sensitivity to this, it is worth wearing a dust mask as is popular in many Asian countries.\n\n'''Be prepared for culture shock'''. If you take photos of the people, ask first and offer to show them their picture if you have a digital camera with a display screen. Children enjoy seeing their pictures a lot of the time.\n\n'''Overwhelmed'''. Many first time visitors may feel overwhelmed if they have not experienced this type of culture difference before. Be polite but not intrusive. It is OK to ask questions of the locals, but you should be prepared to be hassled a lot of the time, especially if you are white. Additionally, for foreigners who are black, it may be possibly to \"blend in\", precautions are in order (depending where you are, in Addis on Bole road they are used to seeing foreigners compared to the countryside). If you prepare yourself before arrival, you will be better able to cope.\n\n===Embassies===\n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*   \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n*  \n\n==Connect==\n\n=== Telephone ===\nThe country code for calling Ethiopia is '''251'''.  The city code for Addis Ababa is '''011''' (or '''+251&amp;nbsp;11''' from outside Ethiopia).\n\n====Mobile====\nEthiopia uses 2G/3G/4G networks operated by Ethiopian Telecommunications Corporation (Ethiotel) and Safaricom. Ethitel has decent national coverage whilst Safaricom is rolling out its network with main cities covered as of mid 2024.\n\nRoaming charges are very steep. your best option for mobile access is to buy a local SIM card.\n\nAn easy option is to buy a SIM card, at 30 birr (June 2019). Ask a cell phone retailer or better still an Ethiotel/Safaricom shop. They will need gto see your passport and to take a photo to register the SIM card.  The Ethiotel service is not 100% reliable.  Monthly internet bundles are available.  For internet access, the Ethiotel APN is etc.com and Safaricom use safaricom.\n\n=== Internet ===\nIn Addis Ababa, especially in Bole Subcity, you can find quite a number of internet cafes. Some still use dial-up connections, but broadband is becoming more popular. Most of the high-end hotels have internet connections (either Ethernet or Wi-Fi), which are reasonably fast and often free for hotel guests.\n\nA general problem with the Internet in Ethiopia is the unstable international high-speed connection. If it is not working, even broadband cafes only deliver dial-up speeds and less. The local definition of highspeed broadband is 128Kb! Another general problem is the shortage of electricity, forcing daytime blackouts of whole areas 1–2&amp;nbsp;days a week, so it is good to plan ahead where you are going for internet access.\n\nSkype and VoIP service are legal in Ethiopia. According to local press, Ethiopia today has the fourth worst internet in the world.\n\n* Dembel City Center on Bole Rd has \"'''Hut Internet Cafe'''\" on the 2nd floor with over 30 Internet capable computers for use every day 10:00-19:00.\n* '''Arkies Business Center''', Piazza, next to 'Taitu Hotels'\n* Broadband Internet in '''DH Geda Tower''', next to Friendship City Center / Bole Rd. 128kbit/s, many seats, but mostly completely occupied. The good thing is that it is easy to find.\n* '''Nina Internetcafe''', across from Baro Hotels, inside Wutema Hotels\n* '''[http://www.tgbusiness.addismap.com/ TG Business Center]''', Bole, from Airport (big roundabout) to the right, junction with Cameroon Rd (locally known as \"Bole-Tele\") has broadband but only 3&amp;nbsp;seats. Most of the time it is not crowded, so a good connection can be expected.\n* '''DMG Internet Center''', near Edna Mall next to Kaldi's Cafe just off Djibuti St (the road leading from Tele Bole towards 22), has broadband connection and 11 terminals. 2&amp;nbsp;MB speed Internet, which translates to pretty decent speed for the country. Open M–Sa 08:30–20:00.\n\n==== Wireless internet ====\n\n3G/4G Internet services are available throughout Addis Ababa. Price is 0.04 birr per 100&amp;nbsp;KB. CDMA is also available, which needs special devices (prices around 0.10&amp;nbsp;birr per minute, around 128&amp;nbsp;kbit/s). EV-DO requires a USB device and is faster than CDMA but requires monthly payment of 500&amp;nbsp;birr for 2&amp;nbsp;GB data plan. CDMA and EV-DO are also available in all regional and most zonal capitals in Ethiopia.\n\n==Go next==\n\n* Adama and Sodere some 120 km to the southeast are popular weekend destinations for locals. The latter is famous for its hot springs. Adama is accessible by bus and train, from there minibuses go to Sodere.\n* Awash National Park, 200 km to the east by road, is a world heritage site where some of the earliest human remains have been found. It's also a good place to see hyenas, and another highlight is the Awash waterfalls.\n* Bahir Dar is 550 km to the north, Ethiopia's third largest city and accessible by bus, car or plane. It's next to Lake Tana, and famous for churches and monasteries on islands in the lake as well as the Blue Nile Falls. From there you can continue to other destinations in Northern Ethiopia such as Gondar and Lalibela.\n* Dire Dawa is an 11-hour train ride east along the new railway to Djibouti (you can fly here too). It's the only other chartered city in the country. A highlight here is Emperor Haile Selassie's Palace. Further 54 kms away from Dire Dawa is the world heritage listed ancient city of Harar, regarded as Islam's fourth holiest city.\n* Melka Awash, with the world heritage listed Paleolithic Melka Kunture excavation sites.\n* Tiya, the \"Stonehenge of Africa\" is a world heritage listed ancient burial grounds, 90 km to the south. Accessible by car or bus.\n* Ziway, 162 km south is on the shore of an eponymous lake which is home to many species of birds. It's one of the Rift Valley lakes, and if you travel some 40 km further south, there are more lakes with birds in the Abijatta Shalla Lakes National Park. Accessible by car or bus.\n\n\n\n"

Gradually the elephants became addicted to the taste of the fruit! This practice stopped along time ago, but the older elephants still remember the smell and have been known to reach into vehicles and get their favourite fruit!\n\n===Landscape===\n\n===Flora and fauna===\n\nThe park has elephant, Black Rhinoceros, Cape Buffalo, lion and leopard on land. In the Marine reserve you will find dolphin, whales (''southern right'') and penguins.\n\n===Climate===\nDue to its terrain, Addo stays at a comfortable 27-30°C throughout the winter.\n\n==Get in==\n\nAddo NP is about 70 km north-east from Port Elizabeth. There is no public transport to or within the park so you need your own car (car rental is available in Port Elizabeth). Or book an organized tour but going on your own pace is really the best option. The park can be visited on a day-trip from Port Elizabeth.\n\nOn the road you might notice signs to the 'Addo Olifant Nasionale Park'. These signs are the old Afrikaans version of the more modern road signs.\n\nThe rangers will do a quick search of your car when you enter and leave the park to make sure no firearms or animals are brought in/out.\n\n==Fees==\n\nValid to 31 October 2017:\n*South African citizens and residents (with ID): R62 per adult, R31 per child, per day\n*SADC nationals (with passport): R124 per adult, R62 per child, per day\n*Foreign visitors: R248 per adult, R124 per child, per day \n\n==Get around==\nThe well-kept tar and dirt road within the park can be driven with any vehicle, 4x4 is not required.

Adelaide is Australia's fifth largest city, with a population of over 1.2 million. More than three quarters of South Australians live in the Adelaide metropolitan area.\n\nAdelaide is on a plain between the rolling Adelaide Hills and the Gulf and is bordered by many of Australia's famous wine regions. The Barossa Valley and Clare Valley regions lie to the north, the McLaren Vale and Langhorne Creek regions to the south and the cooler climate Adelaide Hills region to the east. Historically known as the City of Churches due to its new world origins as an incubator for religious freedom, much of the architecture in the inner city is retained from the colonial era. Heavily influenced by the prevailing styles popular in England at the time, the heritage architecture is similar to many European cities built in the 19th century. The city is built on a grid plan, featuring tree-lined city streets unusually wide and spacious for an Australian metropolis and six city squares bordered by parklands.\n\nProximity to premium wine and food growing regions, as well as waves of immigration from Germany, Italy, Greece, Poland, Vietnam, Malaysia, China and India have created a unique multicultural gourmet food and cafe culture in the City and inner suburbs. This cafe culture is supported by Adelaide's global reputation for the arts and particularly the arts festivals held in March including the [http://www.adelaidefestival.com.au Adelaide Festival] and the [http://www.adelaidefringe.com.au Adelaide Fringe Festival], which is second only to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in size.\n\nThe city is the home of Adelaide Oval, famed as one of Test cricket's most picturesque grounds and has been redeveloped to host Australian rules football matches during the winter months, a sport which has a long history in the city. Adelaide and the surrounding wine regions also host the [http://www.tourdownunder.com.au Tour Down Under], which is the largest cycling race in the Southern Hemisphere and the first stage of the UCI WorldTour.\n\nAdelaide is less bustling than any of the other major capital cities, and a relative lack of tall buildings means it more closely resembles a smaller city such as Hobart or Canberra. Due to its laid-back nature, it is often nicknamed \"Australia's largest country town\".\n\n==Districts==\n\n===Inner regions===\n\n\n===Outer regions===\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==Understand==\nThe South Australia time zone is '''30 minutes behind''' Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST) used in Victoria (state)|Victoria, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania. It's also an hour and a half ahead of Australian Western Standard Time (AWST), used in Western Australia and 45 minutes ahead of Eucla which uses Central Western Standard Time (CWST). South Australia observes Daylight Savings Time, similar to other southern/southeastern states but unlike Western Australia, Queensland, or the Northern Territory. \n\nThe NSW cities/towns of Broken Hill and Silverton also follow the same time as South Australia.\n\n===Climate===\n\n&lt;!--awaiting correct importation of relevant templates from Wikipedia - it's beyond me today and it's too bloody hot anyway 27 Jan 2014\n --&gt;Adelaide is Australia's driest capital city, with summers that are hot and dry, and with winters that are slightly more wet and cool.\n\nIn '''summer''', the average maximum is 29°C (84°F) but there is considerable variation and Adelaide can usually expect several days a year when the daytime temperatures soar above 40°C (104°F). Rainfall is light and infrequent throughout summer. The average in January and February is around 20 millimetres (0.8 inches) but completely rainless months are by no means uncommon. Given the regular hot weather, virtually every public building, indoor tourist destination and most public transport is fully air-conditioned. The sun is up from 6AM to 8:30PM.\n\nIn '''winter''' from June to August, the average maximum is 15–16°C (59–61°F) and the minimum is usually around 8°C (46°F). Winter sees regular rainfall with June being the wettest month of the year, averaging around 80mm. Frosts are common in the valleys of the Adelaide Hills, but rare elsewhere. Adelaide experiences no snowfall in the city centre itself, although on very rare occasions a small sprinkling can be observed on higher ground at the top of Mount Lofty in the Adelaide Hills. Sunrise and sunsets occur around 7:15AM and 5:15PM in the winter.\n\n'''Autumn''' and '''spring''' are slow, gradual changes between the extremes of summer and winter. From mid-February to late March, Adelaide goes into its '''mad March''' festival season of arts, music and sport festivals to take advantage of the moderate weather. Spring also makes a good time to visit Adelaide, as flowers are usually in bloom following the rains of winter.\n\n===History===\n====Aboriginal history====\nThe first people to live on the Adelaide plains were the '''Kaurna people''', whose territory extended from what is now Port Broughton to Adelaide's north, south to Cape Jervis on the southern tip of the Fleurieu Peninsula. The Kaurna lived on the Adelaide plains in family groups called ''yerta'', a word which also referred to the area of land which supported the family group. Each yerta was the responsibility of Kaurna adults who inherited the land and had an intimate knowledge of its resources and features. Adelaide's rich Indigenous Australian culture|Aboriginal history and living culture can be explored at [http://www.tandanya.com.au Tandanya], an Aboriginal-owned culture and history centre on Grenfell Street. Tandanya is free to visit and tours are available for a small charge.\n\n====European settlement====\n\nFollowing the mapping of South Australia's coastline in the early 19th century by European explorers Matthew Flinders and Nicolas Baudin, an expedition down the Murray River was held which reported favourably on land on the coast of Gulf St Vincent. At the same time, British reformers were keen to establish a colony based on free settlement rather than by the transportation of convicts, as all the other Australian colonies at the time were founded. In 1834, the South Australia Company was founded and it convinced the British Parliament to pass a law which created a colony for free settlers in South Australia. In December 1836, after a 10 month journey by a fleet of ships from England, the first Governor, John Hindmarsh proclaimed the creation of the new province in a ceremony in what is now the beachside suburb of Glenelg.\n\nAfter wrangling between the colonists, Adelaide's first surveyor, William Light designed a city grid of wide boulevards surrounded by parklands, with one central square (Victoria Square) and four smaller squares (Hindmarsh, Light, Whitmore and Hurtle) set on the southern banks of the Torrens. Light's original design, with small changes, largely survives to this day.\n\nThe city's early industries were based around mining and agriculture, with England as the key export market. The relatively radical politics of many of the free settlers led to Adelaide being home to early progressive reform including the secret printed ballot, the first jurisdiction in the world to allow women to vote and run for Parliament and early trade unionisation and activism.\n\n====Post-Federation====\nFollowing Australian federation in 1901, South Australia began to move into secondary manufacturing industries, a process which was sent into overdrive by the long term government of the conservative Premier Thomas Playford following World War II. Playford set out to actively attract manufacturing companies like General Motors to South Australia by offering cheap land and low taxes. This, along with the growing ubiquity of car transport, led to Adelaide's relatively low density as workers lived close to the factories where they worked in the outer suburbs.\n\nMass migration from southern Europe transformed Adelaide's Anglo-Celtic culture, with Greek migrants mainly settling in the inner western and inner southern suburbs and Italian migrants settling in the inner eastern and north-eastern suburbs. These cultural identities persist to today, with continental delis and cafés being a common feature of Adelaide's inner city. Adelaide also received much immigration from Central Europe, in particular Germany and Poland, and their influence is most noticeable at the butchers, with some of them selling German and Polish-inspired sausages.\n\nWhile South Australia's economy boomed, its public and cultural life lost much of its early radicalism, with blue laws requiring bars and pubs to close at six in the evening - causing the \"six o'clock swill\". The White Australia policy also meant that Adelaide residents were overwhelmingly from European backgrounds.\n\n====Cosmopolitan capital city====\nThe 1960s saw a dramatic change in Adelaide's cultural life, with the start of the Adelaide Festival of Arts and Adelaide Fringe Festival, which transformed Adelaide's arts culture and the end of the decade saw the election of the first Labor government since the 1930s. By 1970, Don Dunstan became Premier of South Australia. Dunstan was a transformational figure and sought to reshape Adelaide in the mould of a modern cosmopolitan capital city. Dunstan's government ended the six o'clock swill, pedestrianised Rundle Street creating Rundle Mall and built the Festival Centre, creating a hub for arts in Adelaide. His government enacted a range of progressive reforms, including making South Australia the first jurisdiction in Australia to legalise homosexuality. This time also saw changes to Australia's immigration laws which saw Vietnamese and Chinese migrants join earlier waves of migration and the creation of communities in the north-west and western suburbs, as well as Gouger Street's multilingual Chinatown precinct next to the Adelaide Central Market.\n\nAfter losing government for one term to the conservatives at the end of the 1970s, Labor returned to office under John Bannon in the 1980s. A more business friendly leader than Dunstan, Premier Bannon sought to drive the development of Adelaide's city, seeing the construction of Adelaide's tallest building now known as Westpac House  and the development of the Adelaide Convention Centre and Adelaide Casino. However, bad bank loans saw the state-backed State Bank of South Australia collapse in the early 1990s, requiring a huge government bailout and plunging the state deep into debt.\n\n====Revival after the State Bank====\nThe 1990s under the Liberal government led by Premiers Dean Brown, John Olsen and Rob Kerin saw the conservative government undertake asset sales and reduce government services to reduce the state debt. This reduction in government spending, as well as the decline of Australian manufacturing following the abolition of the tariff wall by the federal government, led to slow growth in South Australia's economy and widespread emigration to the eastern capitals, particularly Melbourne.\n\nLabor returned to office in 2002 under Mike Rann who sought to reshape Adelaide's industrial base to focus on education services, mining and defence industry, as well as building on its strengths in wine. Rann's government invested heavily in rebuilding the city, with overhauls to public transport, the construction of a new central hospital and the redevelopment of Adelaide Oval. Following ten years with Premier Rann as leader, Labor elected Jay Weatherill as premier in 2011, who has largely continued this agenda, but with a renewed focus on transforming public spaces in the inner city through the relaxation of planning restrictions and looser liquor licensing for small bars.\n\n\n===Tourist information ===\n* [https://www.experienceadelaide.com.au/ Visit Adelaide] website\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By plane===\n*  | url=http://www.aal.com.au | email=\n| address= | lat=-34.945 | long=138.530556 | directions=around  to the west of the city centre and is close to popular tourist beaches at Glenelg and Henley Beach\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\n| hours= | price=\n| wikipedia=Adelaide Airport | image=AdelaideAirportSkyline.jpg | wikidata=Q14302\n| content=Adelaide Airport is well-connected to other major cities in Australia, and has daily international flights to hubs in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and New Zealand which allow for one-stop connections around the globe.

There are also flights to Alice Springs and Cairns.\n\n'''Regional services''' and operations are provided by Regional Express Airlines (''Rex''), Alliance Airlines, Cobham Airlines and Qantaslink flights operated by both Cobham Airlines and by Alliance Airlines. These services operate mainly to South Australia's regional cities and towns including Mt Gambier, Kingscote (Kangaroo Island), Port Lincoln and Whyalla, but also serve Mildura in Victoria (state)|Victoria and Broken Hill in New South Wales.\n\nThere is only a single terminal for international and domestic departures; accordingly, transfers are relatively seamless. The airport has ATMs and currency change. Food and shopping is available both landside and airside. Lockers are available in the car rental area in the carpark, including some larger lockers that would fit bike boxes. Free Wi-Fi is available throughout the terminal.\n\n====General aviation====\nAdelaide Airport has a separate terminal for general aviation, but most private planes use  18km north of the City.\n\n==== Between the airport and the city====\n'''Adelaide Metro's [https://www.adelaidemetro.com.au/plan-a-trip/visiting-adelaide/adelaide-airport-bus airport buses J1/J2/J7/J8]''' connect the airport with the City, Glenelg and some major shopping centres. J1 Services depart every 15 minutes 8AM to 6PM every day to the City, less frequent from 5AM to 11PM. The journey to the City takes around 25 minutes during peak hour. Services to Glenelg are every half hour during the day, less at night. Services to Arndale, West Lakes and Marion shopping centre are hourly during weekdays.\n\nBuses depart from a single dedicated stop outside the main terminal. All buses in all directions leave from this one stop, so check the front of the bus to make sure its heading where you want to go! Realtime bus information is [https://www.adelaidemetro.com.au/stops?id=17327 available for this stop] and all Adelaide Metro stops or via a range of [https://www.adelaidemetro.com.au/using-adelaide-metro/public-transport-apps apps] for your Mobile phones|smartphone. You don't even need to get a ticket; just [https://www.adelaidemetro.com.au/tickets-and-fares/tap-and-pay tap and pay] with your bank card or compatible device.\n\nThe JetBus is part of the Adelaide Metro network, so the standard ticket types and fares in the #Public_transport|public transport section apply, and a ticket used on the JetBus can be used with another bus, train or tram according to its type. metroCARDs are also available for sale at the airport from a vending machine next to the JetBus stop.\n\n'''Taxis''' are available downstairs out the front of the terminal. A taxi to the City costs around $30 during the morning peak hour and around $20 at other times, which can make it as economical as the JetBus for a group. Drivers will always use the meter, but a $2 surcharge is payable in addition to the metered amount for pickups from the airport.\n\nMajor national '''rental car companies''' operate kiosks on the ground floor near baggage claim. The car rental car park is on the ground level directly opposite the terminal.\n\n===By car===\nAdelaide is at least a day's drive away from the capital cities on the Australian east coast. The shortest driving route from Adelaide to Melbourne takes 8–9 hours (see Overland travel between Melbourne and Adelaide). There are some freeway sections, but the roads are mostly 2-lane roads of highway quality.\n\nFrom '''Melbourne''', Adelaide is via Horsham (Victoria)|Horsham (A8) or  via Mount Gambier|Mt Gambier (A1/B1). The journey via Mt Gambier takes you through the Coonawarra wine region, one of the most renowned cabernet sauvignon regions in Australia and is also convenient for a side tour via the Great Ocean Road. The trip via Horsham is more direct, but has fewer tourist attractions.\n\nFrom '''Sydney''', Adelaide is 1,422 km (884&amp;nbsp;mi) via Wagga Wagga and Mildura (A20).  Freeway conditions from Sydney to Wagga Wagga (the divided highway ends at Tarcutta, but it's only a mere 40 km from there) cut hours from the trip. This route also passes close to Canberra, Australia's national capital, which is 1,196 km (743&amp;nbsp;mi) from Adelaide.\n\nAnother option from Sydney is the  route via Broken Hill (A32), which takes you through the Outback and one of Australia's most historic mining towns. The  route from '''Brisbane''' also goes via Broken Hill.\n\nWhile Adelaide is the closest capital city to '''Perth''', the  journey across the Nullarbor is still arduous, though it's a unique drive through some of the most remote places in the inhabited world. Kalgoorlie–Boulder, another one of Australia's historic mining towns, can be visited on a short detour along this route. Similarly, the  journey north to '''Darwin''' via Alice Springs travels through the true Outback and Uluru is only three hours from the main highway north. However, both these drives are usually drives that ordinary Australians only do about once or twice in their lifetimes.\n\n===By train===\nAdelaide is the main hub for '''[https://www.journeybeyond.com/ Journey Beyond]''', the main operator of long-distance interstate trains in Australia. The Ghan runs to Alice Springs and Darwin, the Indian Pacific runs to Perth and Sydney, and Across Australia by train|The Overland runs to Melbourne. The former two are luxury experiences, and offer sleepers, meals in a dedicated restaurant car, and the opportunity to take your car with you if you are travelling to or from Perth or Darwin. However, they take considerably longer than driving yourself. The Ghan and the Indian Pacific are also generally more expensive than a plane ticket would be, but the Overland is usually cheaper — even the equivalent of a business-class Overland ticket is comparable to an economy-class Adelaide-Melbourne flight on a full-service airline. The Overland stops at a number of rural locations between Adelaide and Melbourne, which may be convenient if your travel itinerary involves some smaller towns. Note that Journey Beyond trains lack Wi-Fi.\n\nThese interstate trains depart from the  just outside of the city. The station can be accessed by car or bus from Richmond Road. Since the demolition of Keswick station, there are no connections to the suburban rail network. Taxis are also available to meet all arrivals.\n\nThere are no country rail services in South Australia.\n\n===By bus===\n'''Interstate buses''' are operated by a number of coach companies including [http://www.greyhound.com.au Greyhound], [http://www.fireflyexpress.com.au/ Firefly] and [http://www.vline.com.au V/Line]. The journey from Melbourne takes around eleven and a half hours, with both day and overnight services. The trip from Sydney can take up to 24 hours and by definition travels overnight. Fares are less than train and most plane travel, at least on the Adelaide-Melbourne route, although if the timing lines up just right an Adelaide-Sydney budget-airline flight may be cheaper than the bus.\n\n'''Regional buses''' to South Australian country cities and towns are also operated by the interstate bus companies, but local South Australian coach companies including [http://www.linksa.com.au LinkSA] and [http://www.premierstateliner.com.au Premier Stateliner] often provide more frequent services.\n\nAlmost all interstate and regional buses depart from the  at 85 Franklin Street in the City. The Central Bus Station operates 5AM-9:30PM, 7 days a week. It has modern amenities as well as a café and it is just across the road from the Adelaide Central Market, a Coles supermarket and Chinatown.\n\n=== By ship ===\n\nA range of cruise ships call at the  during the cruise boat season, which runs from November to April each year. A list of ships arriving in Adelaide is available from [http://portmis.flindersports.com.au Flinders Ports].\n\n==Get around==\n\n===By train===\nAccurate transit directions can be obtained through Google and Apple Maps. To navigate around, just enter your \"to\" address and \"from\" address (or use current location) on your device (including iPhone, Android), then select the public transport icon. Realtime arrival information is available from the Adelaide Metro website or a number of apps for smartphones (e.g. Transittimes), use the time before your vehicle arrives to have a look around the nearby area.\n\n====Routes====\n\nThe [https://www.adelaidemetro.com.au Adelaide Metro] train system has four main lines radiating out of  on the northern edge of the City, with two additional branch lines. Despite its name, it is not a Metro system in the usual sense of the word, but a suburban commuter rail system.\n\nTravelling '''north''':\n\n* The '''Outer Harbor Line''', which goes up the Le Fevre Peninsula in the north-west of the city via Port Adelaide and Glanville. The Outer Harbor line is convenient for the Semaphore tourist precinct, the historic maritime district in Port Adelaide and the Queen Street cafe strip in Croydon. The '''Grange line''' branches off the Outer Harbor line at Woodville.\n* The '''Gawler Line''', to Gawler Central in the north of the city, through Ovingham, Mawson Lakes, Salisbury and Elizabeth.\n\nTravelling '''south''':\n\n* The electrified '''Seaford Line''', which extends to Seaford in the far south of the city, via the beachside suburb of Brighton and Noarlunga Centre. The Seaford line provides access to beaches at Brighton and Hallett Cove, and to Westfield Marion at Oaklands. The '''Flinders Line''' (formerly known as the ''Tonsley Line'') branches off the Seaford line and terminates at Flinders University.\n* The picturesque '''Belair Line''' which extends to Belair in the Adelaide foothills through Blackwood and the inner south-eastern suburbs of the city. The Belair line is useful to access Belair National Park.\n\nBicycles can be taken on trains (but not on trams or buses). On Monday to Friday before 9AM and between 3-6PM a peak concession fare is required (except for Seniors Card members). All other times bicycles can be taken for free.\n\n====Ticketing and route information====\nMetropolitan train, tram and bus services are operated under the unified brand name '''Adelaide Metro''' and use a unified ticketing system, \"Metroticket\".\n*\n\nSingle trip tickets with unlimited transfers for two hours are sold on buses, trams and at major train stations for $5.90 peak and $4 off-peak. Alternatively, a $11.20 daytrip ticket is available, allowing unlimited travel within the Adelaide Metro area for an entire day.\n\nTravellers in Adelaide for longer than a couple of days should buy a metroCARD for $10 which comes with $5 of value included. Trips on metroCARD cost $4.05 peak and $2.25 off-peak. metroCARDs are sold at major train stations (Adelaide, Elizabeth, Gawler, Noarlunga Centre, Oaklands, Mawson Lakes and Salisbury) as well as most newsagents and corner stores. [https://www.adelaidemetro.com.au/using-adelaide-metro/retailers-and-facilities A list of locations is on the Adelaide Metro website]. metroCARDs can be topped up wherever they are sold as well as on trains and trams using coins or major credit cards.\n\nThere is also a $26 Visitor metroCARD that can be used for unlimited travel on the network for 3 days. After the 3-day period, the pass can be topped up and used just like a normal metroCARD.\n\n'''Off-peak''' is on Monday to Friday between 9:01AM and 3PM, and all day on Sundays and public holidays. All other times are '''peak''' times.\n\nThere are '''[https://www.adelaidemetro.com.au/plan-a-trip/free-and-special-transport free trams and buses]''' in the City centre (see below for details). For those services you don't need a metroCARD or paper MetroTicket.\n\n=== By bus ===\n\nThe Adelaide Metro has a comprehensive bus network, centred in the City. Full maps and information are available at the [https://www.adelaidemetro.com.au/plan-a-trip/network-maps Adelaide Metro website]. '''Most main roads including cafe precincts''' like The Parade, Prospect Road, Henley Beach Road, King William Road and O'Connell St are 'Go Zones' which have regular buses on weekdays at least every 15 minutes until the early evening. Adelaide's bus network extends out to the outer suburbs, to the Adelaide Hills in the east, down to McLaren Vale in the south (although buses there are infrequent) and as far as Gawler in the north. It does not cover the Barossa Valley. Frequencies in the outer suburbs are much lower than in the City.\n\nThe '''O-Bahn''' is a bus rapid transit (BRT) line which runs to Adelaide's north-eastern suburbs. O-Bahn buses run from Grenfell Street in the City, entering the O-Bahn at Hackney and stop at Klemzig, Paradise and Modbury Interchanges. After finishing on the O-Bahn, the buses drive the same as a regular bus to reach their destination. O-Bahn services are very frequent, as often as every 3 to 5 minutes during peak hour to interchanges and every 15 minutes off-peak.\n\nBe warned that bus frequency declines sharply after 7PM, with hourly intervals being typical in the outer suburbs, half hourly along Go Zones and every 15 minutes on the O-Bahn. All services cease operation around midnight, so check your timetables and expect to catch a taxi if required if you are out after this time. Very basic ''After Midnight'' bus services along limited routes operate hourly after midnight ''on Saturday nights only''.\n\nThe '''free''' '''City Connector 99A and 99C''' (anti-clockwise and clockwise loop) buses each have about 30 stops taking in all the major cultural and commercial centres in the City, beginning at Victoria Square and including Adelaide Railway Station. The buses feature ground-level access ramps. They run every 30min on Monday to Friday from 8:30AM–7:00PM for the 99A, and from 8:15AM–7:15PM for the 99C. They do not operate on the weekend or on Christmas Day or Good Friday.\n\nThe '''free City Connector 98A and 98C''' (anti-clockwise and clockwise loop) buses operate every day. They cover the same City centre area as the 99A and 99C, and include a loop in North Adelaide.\n\nThe 99A, 99C, 98A and 98C services combined run every 15min Monday-Friday.\n\n=== By tram ===\nAdelaide has '''a tram line''' which runs from the Adelaide Entertainment Centre in Hindmarsh along North Terrace to the Botanic Garden. A second line starts from the Royal Adelaide Hospital through the City then down through the south-western suburbs to the beachside suburb of Glenelg. The Railway Station is a convenient stop to swap between the lines. Travel in the City between the Adelaide Entertainment Centre, Botanic Garden and South Terrace is '''free''', while travel to Glenelg needs a ticket or a metroCARD. Tickets can be purchased from ticket machines on all trams or at some stops.\n\nAs well as being convenient for popular tourist destination Glenelg from the City, the tram also stops at Rundle Mall, Victoria Square near the Adelaide Central Market and at North Terrace near Adelaide Railway Station. Travelling north on the tram takes you to Hindmarsh and Bowden, the home of the Adelaide Entertainment Centre venue for stadium concerts as well as a popular cafe and restaurant strip along Port Road and the side streets alongside.\n\nIf you're driving a car, a convenient (and popular) '''alternative to parking in the City''' is to park at the Entertainment Centre and catch the tram into the City. It only costs $4 for a whole weekday, which is much cheaper than city parking.\n\n===On foot===\nThe city centre is relatively compact and can be easily covered on foot. Most attractions are centred around the blocks between North Terrace and Victoria Square on either side of King William Street. The core Rundle Mall shopping district is entirely pedestrianised. The Gouger Street precinct and the Adelaide Central Market are also great destinations for a walking traveller.\n\nTravellers keen to keep up on jogging while away can use popular jogging tracks along the River Torrens and through the Parklands.\n\n===By taxi===\n\nAdelaide has three main taxi companies which operate 24/7:\n\n* \n* \n* \n\nCabs in South Australia are '''white''' (even those operated by 'Yellow Cabs') and they are clearly marked. It is generally possible to hail a taxi in the street or from a major hotel during business hours in the City, but in the suburbs you typically need to call one of the company booking services listed. There are a number of cab ranks which are staffed by the Taxi Council at night on weekends. Supervised taxi ranks offer extra security with lights and supervision by a concierge and a security officer. They operate 11PM-3AM on Fridays and 11PM-5AM on Saturdays. [http://www.taxicouncilsa.com.au A map of locations is available on their website].\n\nAll taxis in Adelaide are required by the State Government to charge a regulated metered tariff, according to the time that the journey commences. Tariff one is the normal tariff rate and tariff two is a higher rate that applies between Monday to Friday 7PM-6AM, and on weekends and public holidays. Drivers almost always use the meter and are legally required to do so. Payment can be made by cash, EFTPOS, debit and credit cards and Cabcharge. It's a good idea to let the driver know if you are planning to pay with a method other than cash before you start your trip, as the machines can be unreliable.\n\n===By car===\nAdelaide's city centre and inner suburbs like Glenelg, Norwood and Prospect are easily traversed walking and using public transport. However, if you are expecting to spend a lot of time outside the city centre or you are planning a trip to a wine region, a car is useful to avoid long trips on public transport or in the case of the Barossa Valley, to get around at all.\n\nUnlike other Australian state capitals, Adelaide does not have a network of freeways leading directly into the city centre. The freeways that exist begin in the outer suburbs and are for the purpose of carrying traffic to the nearby country towns. Speed limits on most major roads are signposted at 60 km/h, though the default speed limit is 50 km/h if no speed limit is posted. Speed limits are strictly enforced, and even creeping ever so slightly above the speed limit may earn you a ticket with a $350 fine.\n\nAll of Adelaide's roads as well as those throughout South Australia are toll-free.\n\nMajor national '''rental car companies''' operate kiosks at Adelaide Airport on the ground floor near baggage claim.\n\n==See==\n\nAdelaide's main important attractions are mostly centred in the City and North Adelaide. Unlike Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane or Perth, Adelaide isn't a place you would want to go specifically for city life and it's a lot less bustling than the other big cities. Instead, Adelaide is more known for its churches, and a trip to Adelaide is never complete without visiting Churches in South Australia|one of its churches, not because of any historical or religious significance, but rather for their architecture. If you can only afford time to see one, '''St. Peter's Cathedral''' in North Adelaide is one of the most iconic churches in Australia.\n\nUnlike other cities, Adelaide does not have a pass covering all the attractions.\n===Parks and gardens===\n\nUnlike most other cities, most of Adelaide's parks and gardens surround the city, forming a nice boundary distinguishing it from the rest of Adelaide instead of them being completely in the outskirts. There is also another boundary around North Adelaide as well, bordering the River Torrens making most of Adelaide's parks and gardens concentrated in that small but yet diverse green patch of land in the city. \n\nMost of the other parks and gardens are otherwise found in the outer suburbs, particularly in the southeastern areas of Adelaide, often spacious and have a vast recreational space.\n\nThe parks in the city and North Adelaide are an obvious sign that you're in a city, while some like Morialta Conservation Park give a feel that you're out and about in the bush while some like Belair National Park have the perfect smooth transition between urban and rural.\n\nWhen it comes to national parks, the area of Adelaide only has three national parks, not like Sydney's eleven national parks, which for some would still be considered a lot for a city of its size. The national parks are listed below:\n* The first national park of South Australia; Adelaide/Belair National Park|Belair National Park is home to numerous significant buildings including an old government house. The park has many walking trails as well as some waterfalls\n* The second national park of Adelaide is somewhat on the border of Adelaide, and is very much a bird sanctuary, the coastal national park of Adelaide/Adelaide International Bird Sanctuary National Park—Winaityinaityi Pangkara|Adelaide International Bird Sanctuary National Park—Winaityinaityi Pangkara (if that name is hard to pronounce or is too long, Adelaide International Bird Sanctuary or Adelaide International Bird Sanctuary National Park will do), is home to several white beaches and is a particularly good place if you want to see dolphins\n* The third and newest national park is Glenthorne National Park—Ityamaiitpinna Yarta (if that's too long, Glenthorne National Park will do) was created in November 2020, which is fairly new compared to the other two national parks and is in the process of being converted to a national park from a conservation park. \n\nDepending on whether you consider Adelaide Hills to be a part of Adelaide, '''Cleland National Park''' was also converted from a conservation park to a national park, which includes several mountain bike and hiking trails and Mt. Lofty, the only place where it ever snows in Adelaide, although that too is very very rare. Nevertheless, it's still a nice park to take a stroll.\n\nIn December 2021, Adelaide was named the world's second \"National Park City\" by the International National Park City Foundation (an organisation to promote national parks) after London which became the first in 2019. It's believed that 95% of Adelaide's residents reside just 400 metres from a park, and over 30% of the city is covered in green space, making Adelaide Australia's greenest city (although almost half of Canberra is taken up in a national park).\n\n===Museums and galleries===\n\n\nAdelaide's museums and galleries are also centred in the city and North Adelaide as well, just like the parks and gardens or most of the things to see or do in Adelaide, but there's a sizable number of museums in the Port Adelaide/Outer Harbor region as well. \n\nJust like any other capital city, Adelaide has an art gallery, a state museum containing historical artifacts from all over South Australia as well as the border areas neighbouring states, an old gaol (old jail) and most of all, a wine centre in the city. In the suburbs, there's also a railway (railroad) museum, an aviation museum along with many others.\n\nOut of all the museums, exhibitions or galleries in Adelaide, these are some that are particularly important:\n* '''National Wine Centre''' – in the Adelaide/City and North Adelaide|city, a trip to South Australia without learning about the state's wine culture is never complete. \n* The '''South Australian Museum''' also in the Adelaide/City and North Adelaide|city is very much South Australia's state museum containing artifacts and an indigenous collection along with several galleries. Just like most museums, it's free.\n* Although South Australia did not have such a large number of migrants unlike Sydney or Melbourne, the '''Migration Museum''' in the Adelaide/City and North Adelaide|city tells stories of immigrants to South Australia throughout history, and it might surprise you more than you think – South Australia is  still a pretty multicultural state, despite stereotypes\n* The '''Art Gallery of South Australia''' in the Adelaide/City and North Adelaide|city is a particular place of interest for those interested in different genres of art.\n\nThere are several other museums, exhibitions and galleries too. See the relevant district articles for information about them.\n\n==Do==\n\n===Beaches===\n\n\nAdelaide's beaches are mostly in Adelaide/West Adelaide|West Adelaide, given the fact that it's the only large district to have a coastline. While Adelaide International Bird Sanctuary National Park—Winaityinaityi Pangkara also has a long coastline, it's protected and not really a beach for swimming.\n\nIf there's anything that's a must at any Adelaide beach, it's surfing at one of the many surf beaches (Glenelg and West Beaches), an Australian classic. Some beaches have surf schools and places where you can rent surfboards, but to a much lesser extent than Sydney. \n\nHowever, there are some beaches in particular, that get more visitors and are more popular beaches than others:\n* '''Glenelg Beach''' – The historic beachside suburb of Glenelg has a jetty, the Grand hotel and many restaurants and cafés. Very popular with young and old, lots of volleyball competitions.\n* '''West Beach''' – Ideal for family walks and swimming. It is reasonably close to both Glenelg and Henley Beach. At Henley Beach there is Henley square which hosts some 15 restaurants - an excellent dining venue. All the beaches along Adelaide's coastline are excellent white sand beaches, some with public toilets and cold water showers. If you want to 'wet a line' there are jetties at (suburban beaches, from north to south) Grange, Semaphore, Henley Beach, Glenelg, Brighton and Port Noarlunga.\n\n===Sport===\nAs every city does, Adelaide also is known for its sport. As with most other Australian cities, Australian rules football (AFL) is the most popular sport, with cricket not far behind. Unlike Queensland or most of New South Wales, rugby league is not popular in Adelaide.\n* '''Cricket''' – During the summer months get down to the '''Adelaide Oval''' for a cricket match. Australia plays host to a couple of touring nations each summer and they will play a few matches at this beautiful ground which is just between the city and North Adelaide, in that small space of greenery. Tickets for internationals tend to be snapped up quickly, but domestic matches are frequent and equally exciting.\n* '''AFL''', the peak league for professional Australian Rules Football. Home games for the local teams the Adelaide Crows and Port Adelaide Power are played at '''Adelaide Oval''' in North Adelaide in the winter months. Tickets are generally reasonably priced, and getting tickets shouldn't be a problem —- check out the [http://www.afl.com.au AFL website] for more details.\n* '''SANFL''', the state Aussie Rules league, has 5 games per weekend at a number of locations throughout the city and suburbs. '''Norwood Oval''', home of the [http://www.norwoodfc.com.au/ Redlegs], is situated on the Parade in Norwood which is home to a variety of restaurant, café and pub options for after the game.\n* Check out the Adelaide United (soccer team) at Hindmarsh Stadium.\n\n===Performance art===\n\n* '''Format Collective''' in 15 Peel St is a two-storey performance space with a permanent zine store which hosts small art shows, some of the more experimental gigs, discussion panels and performance art. Much of this is concentrated in the yearly Format Festival which is on at the same time as the Fringe Festival and is considered a more experimental alternative, although there are things on all year round. Known for its hipsters, Japanese beer, and nostalgic games of four-square.\n\n===Events===\n\nOne of the best times of the year to visit is during '''Mad March''', when a multitude of festivals and events are held. These include the Adelaide Fringe, the Clipsal 500 Car race, the Adelaide Festival, WOMADdelaide and the Adelaide Cup horseracing carnival.\n* '''Adelaide 500''' (Superloop Adelaide 500) – During mid-March, the Adelaide 500 supercar racing event is very popular, sporting massive street parties, huge concert line-ups and many fanatic Adelaidians.\n* '''Adelaide Fringe Festival''' – During late Feb-March, the Fringe Festival (second largest of its type in the world) and Festival of Arts bring the city alive with music, arts, dance and culture from all over the world. Both are large and very popular events visited by people from all over the world.\n* '''WOMADelaide''' (World of Music Arts and Dance) – A hugely popular music festival now held every year in March. People come here from all over Australia and overseas. It shows Adelaide at its very best.\n\n==Learn==\n\nThree different universities call Adelaide home, of which the '''[http://www.adelaide.edu.au/ University of Adelaide]''' is the best regarded. The other two universities in the Adelaide area are the '''[https://www.unisa.edu.au/ University of South Australia]''' and '''[http://www.flinders.edu.au/ Flinders University]'''.  There are opportunities for international students to enrol in these universities, either as degree students, or as part of exchange programs with foreign universities.\n\n==Buy==\n\n\nUnlike the \"big four\" Australian cities, top-end luxury brands like Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Prada do not have a presence in Adelaide. The Victorian Adelaide/City and North Adelaide#Buy|Adelaide Arcade&lt;!--|lat=-34.92293| long=138.60379}}--&gt; that runs south from Rundle Mall has a fine collection of boutiques and specialist shopping such as numismatics, antiques and chocolatiers. Another good place to look for semi-luxury items would be [http://www.burnsidevillage.com.au/ Burnside Village] in the eastern suburbs.\n\n===Malls and shopping precincts===\nAlthough Adelaide has many malls and shopping precincts, there are some that are of particular interest to travellers:\n* '''Rundle Mall''' in Adelaide/City and North Adelaide|Adelaide City – a pedestrian-only shopping strip, with many arcades and side streets coming off it. Runs parallel to North Terrace. Over 800 shops.\n\n* '''Tea Tree Plaza''' (TTP for short) in Adelaide/Salisbury, Playford and Tea Tree Gully|Tea Tree Gully – a medium-sized shopping centre with over 250 shops. Tea Tree Plaza is the terminus of the Adelaide O'Bahn dedicated busway which begins in the city centre at Hackney Rd. It is easy to get there from the city centre; most of the buses that stop on the Grenfell St stops travel to the [https://www.adelaidemetro.com.au/stops?id=11347 TTP interchange] via the O'Bahn busway. It's easy to see from a distance as it has the large antenna and supporting pyramid type structure, well-known to the locals, on the roof of the Myer department store. Ample parking is available around, on top of, and underneath the complex. The much smaller Tea Tree Plus shopping centre is right next to Tea Tree Plaza.\n* '''Westfield Marion Shopping Centre''' in Adelaide/West Adelaide|West Adelaide – Adelaide's largest shopping mall with over 400 shops. There are direct buses from the city centre to this Westfield.\n* '''Harbour Town''' also in Adelaide/West Adelaide|West Adelaide just next to the airport – it's a mid-sized mall undergoing an expansion, featuring outlet shopping, situated up against the western edge of the Adelaide Airport. Only a short bus ride from the Airport, and 30&amp;nbsp;minutes from the city and North Adelaide. Also, no, this is not a spelling mistake.\n\n===Food Shopping===\nWhen it comes to food markets, Adelaide is never short of them. Some in particular include:\n* '''The Central Market''' between Grote and Gouger St, west of Victoria Square in Adelaide/City and North Adelaide – which has all your fresh fruit and veggies under one Victorian roof. It's not just vegetarians that will salivate here since foods and non-foods of every variety compete for the best displays. For those looking to buy food to take back home, Central Market is probably what you'd be looking for\n* '''Chinatown''' While it may come to a surprise for many, Adelaide also has a Chinatown, which is a pedestrian-only area (Moonta St) adjacent to Central Market.\n* '''City East IGA''' – this IGA won the best IGA Supermarket in SA for its amazing food range, including Greek, Italian, Chinese and Indian ranges. As its name implies, it's in the eastern side of city\n* '''Gaganis Brothers''' in Adelaide/West Adelaide|West Adelaide is a food wholesaler but sells to the public with an amazing selection of ethnic foods. Most items available in larger quantities.\n\n==Eat==\n\n===Local dishes===\nAdelaide's local cuisine generally does not differ much from standard Australian fare, but there are a handful of dishes unique to Adelaide that are worth trying while you're here.\n\nThe '''pie floater''' is an Australian meat (usually beef) pie in thick pea soup, often garnished with ketchup. This is sold at numerous pubs and cafes throughout Adelaide, but the place locals will point you to if you want to get the most classic version is '''Cafe de Vili's''' in Mile End South.\n\nThe '''AB''' is Adelaide's answer to the halal snack packs of the East Coast, consisting of yiros meat on top of a bed of hot chips, and topped off with tomato sauce, chilli sauce, garlic sauce and barbecue sauce, though it is not halal. Two shops, namely the '''North Adelaide Burger Bar''' (also known as the Red &amp; White) and the '''Blue &amp; White''', both in North Adelaide, claim to have invented the dish.\n\n===The BYO culture===\n\nWhile fairly unusual in the rest of the world, it's common for restaurants in Australia and New Zealand to allow patrons to bring bottled wine to dinner. This practice is called 'BYO', short for \"bring your own\". Originally resulting from a loophole in liquor licensing laws, BYO is now a great opportunity to enjoy some of the wine which you have bought in a wine region, or to visit a local 'bottle shop' and enjoy a wider selection at lower prices.\n\nNowhere in Australia is BYO more common than in Adelaide. Most restaurants in Adelaide which serve alcohol will also allow BYO, though it's a good idea to call ahead to make sure. It's common for a charge called 'corkage' to be applied to the bill. Corkage will typically be around $10–15 per bottle, though higher charges are not unheard of. Corkage is applied even if your wine is under a screwtop rather than a cork, like virtually all recently produced Australian wine.\n\n===City===\n\n\nThe City caters to virtually every different taste and price range. Adelaide has one of the largest number of restaurants and cafes per person in Australia and most of the best are in the City.\n\n* '''Gouger Street, Chinatown and the Central Market precinct''' is a multicultural food and wine paradise. Best known in Adelaide for good quality Asian food at a reasonable price, Gouger Street attracts a wide range of clientele from lawyers and public servants from the adjacent courts and State government precinct to new migrants. Chinatown and Gouger St is the hub of Chinese cuisine and culture in Adelaide and there are a wide range of Chinese restaurants along the strip. Other Asian cuisines are also featured including Thai, Vietnamese and Indian. On the northern side of Gouger St, the Adelaide Central Market has a great range of hawker style food stalls as well as a few older European cafes. The last decade has also seen the emergence of high-end dining on Gouger St, with a number of more expensive options joining the long standing and locally famed Argentinian restaurant, Gaucho's.\n* '''Rundle Street and the East End''' is the traditional hub of Italian and Greek cuisine in Adelaide, but there are also newer Chinese, Thai and Japanese restaurants. Like Gouger St, it has options across the spectrum of budgets, with the western end of the street closer to Adelaide University catering more to the budget end while the eastern end is more upmarket. The East End laneways off of Rundle Street have a range of smaller, quirkier cafes - Ebenezer Place, Bent Street and Union Street all have a few alternative options.\n* '''Waymouth Street and Pirie Street''' have emerged as new eating destinations over the last decade, particularly for an upmarket lunch. Waymouth Street, on the western side of King William Street, has a range of high end cafes, bistros and bars, while Pirie Street has a few new cafes.\n* '''Hindley Street''' is best known for its bars and nightlife, but has a range of multicultural food options, particularly Middle Eastern and Asian. The '''Leigh Street and Bank Street''' laneways have also emerged as dining destinations in their own right.\n* '''Hutt Street''' is smaller scale and offers a small variety of upmarket restaurants that please most tastes, and also has a wide variety of gourmet shops and supermarkets.\n* '''The South West Corner''' of the City's square mile, south of the Gouger Street precinct, is more residential but includes some of Adelaide's most interesting dining experiences sprinkled among the heritage homes and apartments.\n\n===North Adelaide===\n\n* An eclectic mix of small restaurants and cafes make '''Melbourne Street''' an interesting place to eat.\n* The variety of take-aways, pubs, cafes, bakeries and restaurants that line most of '''O'Connell Street''' means you won't be wanting. It is also home to both shops that claim to have invented the AB.\n\n===Suburbs===\n\n* '''The Parade''', Norwood has a long stretch of shopping and cosmopolitan dining. Buses from the CBD numbering 122-124 or a very short taxi ride.\n* '''Jetty Road / Mosley Square''', Glenelg has a variety of restaurants and pubs at the end of a 30&amp;nbsp;minute tram journey.\n* '''Stuart Road''', Dulwich features two cafes, a licensed restaurant and a very good bakery. Catch the 145 or 146 from North Ter which heads along Fullarton Rd and up Dulwich Ave.\n* '''[http://www.kingwilliamroad.com.au/ King William Road]''', Hyde Park is an upmarket strip of fashionable cafes, coffee shops and restaurants.\n\n===Budget===\nThere are a lot of budget eateries in Adelaide. They don't usually look like much from the outside but most have something going for them - the reason that they are still in business. It pays to look through menus plastered onto doors. Cheap eats should be anywhere from $8–14 for a main, and no more.\n\nThere aren't many chains specific to Adelaide, with the sole exception of '''[https://www.fastapasta.com.au/ Fasta Pasta]''' which you can expect to pay from $10 for a plate of pasta. The chain has somewhat become the fast food version of pasta. In more recent times, it can now be found in other states and its popularity in South Australia is due to the chain having started in Adelaide.\n\n===Mid-range===\nAlthough there are a lot of budget eateries in Adelaide, there are more mid-range eateries. They can be found in every part of Adelaide, and if you're on a budget and in an area without budget eateries. Pubs are generally a good place to look for mid-ranged food, with most pubs featuring fish and chips, as well as other Australian staples such as steaks, lamb chops, schitzels, pasta and risotto.\n\nAs with nearly everything in Adelaide, much of it can mainly be found in the city and North Adelaide, but there's plenty of them in smaller town centres. Cuisine wise, it's pretty easy to find Italian and Indian cuisines. Finding Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and Thai) cuisines are also easy, but may not match the standards in Sydney while finding Greek and Mediterranean cuisine is also easy, but may not match the standard found in Melbourne.\n\n===Splurge===\nFinding a fine dining restaurant in the city is pretty easy, but finding one in the suburbs is considerably less so. That said, the suburbs also have some excellent fine dining options if you know where to look. The nearby wine regions like McLaren Vale and the Barossa Valley also have excellent fine dining options, with several wineries having restaurants overlooking their vineyards that only open for lunch. Unlike other cities, if you're going to a fine dining restaurant, there is no dress code. See the #Dress codes section.\n\n===Dress codes===\nAs Australians are generally casual, feel free to wear whatever you think suits well. Although most people make an effort to dress up for fancier restaurants, there is no requirement and both restaurants and diners alike are relaxed about dress standards, and so it's not uncommon to see people wearing jeans at restaurants, especially among the younger generations.\n\n==Drink==\n\nThere are pubs and bars (also known as \"hotels\" in Australia) dotted all around the CBD, but a few districts are worth singling out. Rundle Street and its neighbouring area  known simply as \"The East End\" have a number of popular pubs. Hindley St used to be notorious as the seedy home of Adelaide's strip clubs and bikie bars, but it, and \"The West End\" have undergone a renaissance. The eastern end of Hindley Street is more mainstream, whereas the western end, west of Morphett Street has a few trendier and more alternative venues. The seedy places are still there, but so too is a university campus and a number of trendy bars and clubs. Also important are Gouger Street and its many restaurants but with an increasing number of bars and pubs.  O'Connell Street is home to a few of North Adelaide's popular pubs.\n\nThere are also many bars in the suburbs of Adelaide which usually are busier on Thursday and Friday evenings. Quite a lot of the locals will go to the hotels in the suburbs on Thursday and Friday evenings, and go into the Adelaide CBD on Saturday evenings.\n\nSmoking in pubs and clubs is banned under South Australian law. Many drinking establishments have outdoor areas where smoking is permitted.\n\n==Sleep==\n), a multi-use building that features a restaurant known as the d'Arenberg Cube Restaurant, a wine tasting room, a virtual fermenter, a 360-degree video room and the Alternate Realities Museum]]\nAdelaide has hundreds of accommodation options in the CBD (central business district, i.e. downtown) to consider, from backpackers hotels to five star hotels. However, there are options out of the central area too.\n\nIf you are travelling on business, there may be business-style accommodation near to where you are working, but otherwise, the city centre generally has more availability. \n\nIf you are into camping, the closest camping to the city is in Belair National Park in the southeastern suburbs of Adelaide. The park is less than 10 km from the city, and there is a train service near the park.\n\nIf you are into the beach, you have no choice but to choose the suburbs closer to the coast. The closest one to the city is Adelaide/West Adelaide|Glenelg, but there are some in Port Adelaide or Outer Harbor too.\n\n===Budget===\n&lt;!--\nATTENTION\nPlease do not remove, change, move around or jumble up the standard Sleep listing fields as this makes it hard to add or change details later.

It may also cause page display anomalies\n\n --&gt;\n\nAs always, your best bet of finding a choice of mid-range accommodation is the CBD (both the city and North Adelaide), often connected to Victoria Square by public transport. Sometimes a cheaper motel-style accommodation can be obtained on the roads leading into Adelaide. Outside the CBD, most accommodation found will likely be mid-range, but the prices may be slightly lower with more facilities.\n\n===Splurge===\n&lt;!--\n\nATTENTION\nPlease do not remove, change, move around or jumble up the standard Sleep listing fields as this makes it hard to add or change details later. It may also cause page display anomalies\n\n --&gt;\nAdelaide has the usual splurge chains such as Hilton or Novotel, mostly concentrated in the CBD. Luxury hotels can be found throughout Adelaide, but in particular, the city and Adelaide/West Adelaide|West Adelaide are worth checking out – the former for convenience, and the latter for its beach views.\n\n==Stay safe==\n\nThe Australia-wide emergency number is 000. The ambulance service, fire service and police are available through this number.  For non-emergency police assistance, dial 131 444.\n\nAdelaide is considered a safe city, and much more so than other mainland Australian capitals. People should however exercise personal safety, particularly at night. Most violent crime in Adelaide is fuelled by alcohol, so be vigilant and avoid any confrontations if you are in the bars or nightclubs at night.\n\nThe city parklands are poorly lit and are best avoided after dark due to the presence of intoxicated people. If you need to cross the parklands to reach the suburbs, stay near the road. Catching a taxi or public transport is recommended at night.\n\nTrains in Adelaide are generally reliable and arrive and depart on schedule. (Buses can be slightly more variable.) There are security guards on all trains after 7PM and many rail services have bus connections available.\n\nAt night, police actively patrol the city centre, especially Hindley Street, the latter being where many of the city's nightclubs and bars are. Taxi ranks are near the Adelaide Casino on North Terrace, the Hilton Adelaide Hotel on Victoria Square, and the junction of Rundle Street and Pulteney Street outside the Hungry Jacks fast food outlet. Most regular public transport services end before or at midnight, but special [https://www.adelaidemetro.com.au/plan-a-trip/free-and-special-transport After Midnight bus services] operate Saturday night only, travelling from the city to brightly-lit points throughout Adelaide's suburbs.\n\nAdelaide occasionally experiences '''Earthquake safety|earthquakes''', but these are usually minor and rarely cause major damage.\n\n==Stay healthy==\n\nAdelaide's remote location in the world's driest continent means that all of its drinking water is sourced from the River Murray or local reservoirs. Although the water is perfectly safe to drink, it does make tap water unpalatable to those not used to it and is best drunk filtered.\n\n==Connect==\nThere is extensive free Wi-Fi access (port 80 only) in the CBD and the airport provided by [http://www.internode.on.net/coverage/ Internode].\n\n==Cope==\n===Consulates===\nAs a relatively minor city, Adelaide does not have many consulates, with the nearest consulates for many countries being located in Melbourne or Sydney.\n\n* \n* \n\n==Go next==\n\n, nestled in the Adelaide Hills, is a popular spot for tourists and locals alike. ]]\n\n* Adelaide Hills, including the Mt Lofty Summit, provides spectacular views of the Adelaide metropolitan area.

With a map you won't go too far in the wrong direction and no doubt have taken a scenic drive.\n\nIn addition to the sealed roads, there are many unsealed or 'dirt' roads. Do not expect to find signage along dirt roads, they are used by locals who mostly know where they are going. Dirt roads do not have a speed limit shown, you are supposed to drive at what you judge is a safe speed. A speed limit sign could be seen as a challenge by some people! \n\nTo the east of the main line of the Adelaide Hills is Onkaparinga Valley Road.

There is also a sizeable Somali minority (war refugees).\n\n=== Climate ===\n\n\n\nThe city swelters through a desert climate all year round, with high temperatures and little to no rain.\n\n==Get in==\n\nAccess to Aden is available by car, airplane and bus. Airfare from Sana'a on Yemenia, the national carrier, is around 10,000 rials or US$55. Buses are generally comfortable and the journey from Sana'a to Aden takes about 8 hours. A ticket costs ~1500 rials. Be prepared to show a travel permit (Tashrih) on military checkpoints. You can't leave capital Sanaa without it. It's good idea to have also few photocopies of your passport ready. If you travel to Aden or elsewhere in Yemen by plane, no travel permit is required.\n\nThere are direct flights to many cities in the Middle East. If you are flying in from outside the region, it will be necessary to transfer in Egypt, Jordan or the United Arab Emirates.\n\n*  | url= | email=\n| address= | lat=12.8253 | long=45.0366 | directions=\n| phone= | tollfree=\n| hours= | price=\n| wikidata=Q1398872\n| lastedit=2023-01-08\n| content=\n}}\n\n==Get around==\n\nThe different current options are:\n* private taxi\n* collective taxi (\"mer mer\") - costing 40 rials from Tawahi to Crater or Sirah for instance (ask for colour codes if you speak Arabic), cheap and easy to use along common routes\n* by foot - for any climbing and to complement many collective taxi trips.\n\nTaxis are practical, yet always bargain with the taxi driver before getting in. Otherwise, they have the tendency to get it done at their high price. If you know the city very well, you can use the mini-buses along with the public. The mini-buses are easy to use; they follow an essentially circular path around the city. Find someone familiar with the area to explain their route as the fare for the buses is around 30 rials, or roughly a tenth of the average taxi ride.  There are also many boats that will take you whenever on a little cruise on the sea.\n\nAden International Airport is accessible, yet if you are in Yemen it is better to drive there. You can also rent cars from international companies.\n\n==See==\n\nSunsets, lagoons (for bird-watching), the Aden museum, Crater (including a shopping district), people, beach and reservoirs.\n\nSights by neighborhood:\n\n===Tawahi (Steamer Point)===\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* Ancient \"Hôtel Univers\" (where Arthur Rimbaud lived)\n* Climbing village\n* Panoramic viewpoints\n\n===Ma'alla===\n* Shopping venue\n\n===Crater===\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* Panoramic viewpoints\n* Rambow Hotel (which is ''not'' Rimbaud's hotel)\n\n===Sirah===\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Do==\n\nAmong activities carried out by the locals that you can easily sample:\n* snooker (\"billiard\")\n* hanging out at fresh juice bars or small restaurants with kubz (giant pita bread)\n* chewing betel (2 versions: tobacco, sweet). This causes cancer in the long-run, and also stains teeth and gums red. Tobacco version is very strong and spitting regularly is highly recommended. The sweet version is particularly tasty and doesn't induce the same urge to spit.\n* chewing qat - the national past-time. This also causes cancer in the long-run; first-time use generally induces restlessness, insomnia and general mouth fatigue and aches\n* climbing on the mountain tops for great views of the city (beware of the no trespassing zone and take abundant water and sun screening equipment)\n* beach activities.\n\nAden is especially known for the beautiful beaches and swimming activities. Besides this, Aden has the only considerable nightlife in Yemen, and foreigners can enjoy wonderful Arabian nights.\n\nSport fishing: tunas and sharks can be hunted near the coast.\n\nA visit at the Gold Mohur Beach and Elephant Bay Hotel is a must. For women travelling alone, there is also a women-only beach at the Sheraton Hotel.  Excellent snorkeling is available although not as clear as Sharm El-Sheikh.\n\n==Buy==\n\nBeautiful scarfs can be purchased in Crater as well as an abaya for the ladies. Spices can also be found in abundance. Other typical local products include: perfumes &amp; incense, men and women's clothing, head scarves, honey, sweets.\n\n==Eat==\nAden is especially known for its fresh fish.\n\n'''Breakfast dishes'''\n*Foul beans and baguette bread or khobez (round pita bread)\n*&lt;nowiki&gt;''Khmir''&lt;/nowiki&gt; (sweet square doughnuts) and tea with milk\n\n'''Dinner or lunch''' \nMoufa or mukbza restaurants have mufa fish, khobez rushwsh, mulwah, rateb (round bread).\n*&lt;nowiki&gt;''Zurbian''&lt;/nowiki&gt; a mixture of lamb and colored rice.\n*&lt;nowiki&gt;''Saiydia''&lt;/nowiki&gt; fish steak (tuna or king  fish) and rice.\n*Shwarma is the snacks in the evening, pita bread and tender grilled lamb meat with Salad\n\n==Drink==\n\nThere are few places in Aden where you can buy alcoholic drinks. Aden is known for its belly dancing events by overseas dancers (e.g. Iraqis and Syrians), which you can find in many tourist places, including Sheraton Aden, Diplomacy Resort, Bahara, Nashwan, and Hotel Aden.\n\nFruit juice bars offer very nice, cheap and wholesome drinks.\n\n==Sleep==\nAden is the tourist and economical capital of Yemen. You have many chances to purchase alcohol, go to clubs and enjoy a sunset in the high-class hotels. There are many 5-star hotels and numerous others.\n\n===Budget===\nThere are many budget, decent and clean hotels and resorts such as:\n\n* \n\n===Splurge===\n\n==Stay safe==\n\nSee the warning on the Yemen article.\n\n==Go next==\n\n\n\n\n"

It covers a vast expanse&amp;mdash;bigger than New Hampshire&amp;mdash;of rugged, thickly wooded, mountainous terrain in northeast New York (state)|New York State. The Adirondacks are a popular destination for all lovers of outdoor activities, from hiking and skiing to ice and rock climbing.\n\n==Towns and villages==\n\nAs the Adirondacks are for the most part protected parkland, there are no major cities. The strict restrictions on development do not apply within the various incorporated villages which were already extant at the time of the park's creation, but the largest of these settlements have no more than a few thousand permanent inhabitants.\n\n===Eastern Lakes===\n&lt;!----&gt;\n\nThis region is directly south of Plattsburgh at the southern edge of Lake Champlain, along I-87 or US-9.\n\n*  — Chestertown plus several surrounding hamlets and lakeside communities on the other side of the Northway from Lake George.\n*  — Ruins of former British fortress (and site of an earlier French fortress) near a bridge to Vermont.\n*  — The Adirondack History Center Museum is a former school house which houses a local history museum.\n*  — Historic federal town in Essex County, once a War of 1812 shipbuilding facility, now a small agricultural village with well preserved early 1800s architecture, galleries, marinas and access to the [http://www.champlainareatrails.com/trails/ Champlain Area Trails] network.\n*  — Vacation spot in upstate New York situated on a lake.\n*  — Home of Fort Ticonderoga, a Revolutionary War Site.\n*  — Cottage country and birthplace of the popular wooden Adirondack chair\n\n===High Peaks===\n*  and Keene Valley — Great rock and ice climbing, hiker's gateway to the Adirondacks.\n*  (aka Adirondac or McIntyre) — An iron and titanium mining ghost town north of ; fewer than ten buildings remain.\n\n===Old Forge and Western wilderness===\n*  - A small hamlet in the town of Indian Lake. Midpoint on the Northern Forest Canoe Trail, hosts the Adirondack Museum.\n*  - A small town which serves as the western gateway to the area from the Mohawk Valley. It is the starting point for the Northern Forest Canoe Trail.\n\n===Tri-Lakes and Northwest===\n*  - Home of the Covered Bridge\n*  - Host to two Winter Olympiads (1932 and 1980), it's now a charming, but tourist town.\n*  - An \"All American City\", this village is host to North Country Community College and adjoins a tiny hamlet which houses Paul Smith's College.\n*  - Home of the Natural History Museum of the Adirondacks.\n*  - Near Lake Placid.

Thomas C. Durant's 1871 Adirondack Railway, the first of multiple lines into the region in an era of wildly-speculative rail construction, is now the [http://www.sncrr.com Saratoga and North Creek Railway] (a heritage railways|heritage railway). Because of the relative ease by which rail brought New York City and Albany (New York)|Albany's wealthy elite northward, by 1875 there were more than two hundred hotels in the Adirondacks and the well-to-do were building \"Great Camps\" along the lakefronts as recreational property.\n\nA Dr. Ed Trudeau, great-grandfather of ''Doonesbury'' cartoonist Garry Trudeau, opened a tuberculosis clinic (the Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium) in Saranac Lake in 1884, believing the cold, clear mountain air of the region to aid in medical recovery. Hundreds of \"cure cottages\", houses with large, glass-enclosed porches where patients would take in the mountain air, were constructed in this era. Robert Louis Stevenson, author of 'Treasure Island' and 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde', spent the winter of 1887-88 in Saranac Lake writing 'The Master of Ballantrae.'  Sixty-three of the cottages still remain on the National Register of Historic Places, although the introduction of suitable antibiotics in the mid-1940s largely eradicated tuberculosis a decade later.\n\nIn the immediate post-Civil War era, logging caused extensive deforestation in the southern Adirondacks, with the topsoil runoff fed directly into the Hudson Valley|Hudson River and Erie Canal watersheds. Adirondack Park was created by New York State in 1892 to protect key natural resources, including freshwater and timber. Waterways which fed from the park into the Erie Canal system and to the Hudson were seen as vital to the continued contribution of the canal to New York's commercial shipping industry. The Adirondack Forest Preserve (the part of the Adirondack Park under state control) was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1963 and attracts several million visitors annually.\n\n===Landscape===\nImage:Giant's Washbasin.jpg|thumb|300px|A small mountain lake east of the High Peaks\nThe Adirondack region is mountainous with about three thousand small lakes, many streams and extensive old-growth forests. Forty-two of the 46 Adirondack High Peaks are above 4,000 feet (1,219 m), with the remaining four (Blake Peak, Cliff Mountain, Nye Mountain and Couchsachraga Peak) just under four thousand feet in height. Whiteface Mountain, near Wilmington and Lake Placid, served as a winter Olympic ski venue in 1980; in summer, a trail is open for mountain biking.\n\n===Flora and fauna===\nThere are 53 known species of mammals in the park; various attempts have been made (with varying success) to introduce or re-introduce beaver, elk, fishers, American marten, moose, Canadian lynx and ospreys. Deer are plentiful. Hawks, owls, fox and weasels have been known to prey upon many species desired by hunters. Wolves and cougars also prey upon other species in the park.\n\nHunting and fishing are allowed in some portions of the Adirondack Park, but are strictly regulated. Some portions are protected from human encroachment as wilderness areas.\n\n===Climate===\nClimate during the winter months can be severe, with temperatures occasionally falling below . The air is cold and clear.\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By car===\nFrom New York City|NYC, Albany (New York)|Albany and Montréal: The main route along the eastern edge of the Adirondacks is Interstate 87, commonly known as \"the Northway.\" There are no tolls north of Albany on I-87; the highway continues north through Montréal (as Autoroute 15) into the Laurentians. The Northway has beautiful views of the mountains, but limited services north of Lake George.\n\nFrom North Country|Northern New York: From Watertown (New York)|Watertown, take NY 3 (Arsenal Street, Watertown's main street) through the park to Saranac Lake. It's also possible to reach the park from the north side by taking US 11 to Malone (New York)|Malone, then turning south on NY 30.\n\nFrom Utica-Rome (New York)|Rome: NY 28 runs north into the park from Herkimer; to pick up NY 28 from Utica use NY 12 northbound, from Rome use NY 365.\n\nFrom Vermont: The Green Mountain State is largely separated from the Adirondacks by Lake Champlain. This usually means crossing by ferry, but there is a Lake Champlain Bridge between the Chimney Point state historic site (on VT 17) and the Crown Point (New York)|Crown Point historic area (in the park, on NY 185). Another option is to head south and miss the lake entirely (so Fairhaven and Rutland (Vermont)|Rutland VT to Lake George is overland). Traffic originating at the northernmost edge of the state (St. Albans, Jay Peak) takes the US 2 bridge at the north end of the lake to Champlain and Rouses Point, then follows I-87 or US-9 through Plattsburgh to the park.\n\n===By bus===\n\nThere is limited [http://trailwaysny.com Trailways] intercity bus travel in the US|bus service from Rochester, Syracuse and Albany to points north including Keene Valley, Lake Placid, Tupper Lake and Plattsburgh.\n\n===By train===\n\n'''[http://www.amtrak.com Amtrak's]''' aptly named ''Adirondack'' train runs between Montreal, Quebec, and Penn Station in New York City. Stops in-region include Port Kent (seasonal, Burlington VT ferry dock), Westport (New York)|Westport (connection to Lake Placid bus), Port Henry, Ticonderoga and Whitehall. The train leaves Montreal at 9:30AM daily, and New York at 8:30AM. The trip takes approximately 10&amp;nbsp;hours but expect delays at the border. It used to be one of the most delayed in the whole Amtrak system, but in the early 2010s some of the issues causing delays have been addressed, notably improving on-time performance.\n\n===By boat===\nThe main Plattsburgh-Burlington ferry crossing runs from Grande Isle VT (west of Colchester across the US 2 bridge) directly to Plattsburgh; from there, take I-87/US-9 south to the park.\n\nThere are also Vermont/Lake Champlain ferry crossings within the park:\n* A ferry crosses from Burlington (Vermont) to Port Kent, near Keeseville\n* A ferry crosses from Charlotte VT to Essex (New York)\n* A ferry crosses from Larrabees VT to Ticonderoga\n\n===By plane===\n* [http://www.capeair.com Cape Air] provides subsidised Essential Air Service twice-daily to Saranac Lake from Boston and a similar service to Plattsburgh.\n* Additional flights are available in Burlington, Montreal/West Island|Montréal-Dorval and Albany.\n\n==Fees and permits==\n\nExcept for improved public campgrounds, there is no fee to camp or travel on state land.\n\nIt is illegal to transport untreated firewood more than 50 miles from its source. Local firewood can easily be found in roadside stands and convenience stores. Retailers include a slip of paper documenting the source of the firewood. Without this proof, your firewood may be seized.\n\n==Get around==\n===By car===\nInterstate 87 runs along the Eastern edge of this area, following a similar path to its predecessor, US Highway 9. NY 30 enters the park from Malone in the north. Access to most of the park is via two-lane New York State highways.\n\nNY 86 joins Lake Placid to Saranac Lake, from which NY 3 goes to I-87 in the east or I-81 Watertown (New York)|Watertown in the west.\n\nThe main roads around the High Peaks region are Route 73 to the north and east which runs through Lake Placid, routes 3 and 30 through Tupper Lake to the west, and route 28N and Boreas road to the South.  Fuel stations are available about every 20&amp;nbsp;miles in these areas.\n\n===By train===\nThe [http://adirondackrr.com Adirondack Scenic Railroad] runs a tourist trains|tourist train from Lake Placid to nearby Saranac Lake, as well as a train in Old Forge.\n\n===By boat===\nImage:Waterfall Keen Valley Adirondacks NY VA.JPG|thumb|Waterfall in Keene Valley\nCruising on small craft is permitted on most of the larger lakes such as Lakes George, Champlain, Raquette, Tupper, Indian, Schroon, and Blue Mountain Lake. Hundreds of smaller lakes, ponds, and streams provide canoe routes of varying length, but not all are open to motorised vessels.\n\nBoat tours are available on Lake George.\n\n==See==\nLocal museums include the [http://www.adkmuseum.org Adirondack Museum] and store in Blue Mountain Lake, the [http://www.hydecollection.org Hyde Collection Art Museum] and Historic House in Glens Falls (near Lake George), the [http://www.wildcenter.org Natural History Museum of the Adirondacks] in Tupper Lake and the [http://www.adirondackvic.org Paul Smith's College] Visitor Interpretive Centre in the hamlet of Paul Smiths (near Saranac Lake).\n\nIn Lake Placid, [http://www.nysparks.com/historic-sites/29/details.aspx John Browns Farm State Historic Site] preserves the last home and burial site of a famed Underground Railroad|abolitionist, while the [http://www.lakeplacidhistory.com/ North Elba Historical Society Museum] (in the former New York Central rail terminal) and a [http://www.whiteface.com/activities/lake-placid-olympic-museum Winter Olympic Museum] (in the Olympic centre) recall sporting history and the 1932 &amp; 1980 Lake Placid winter games.\n\n[http://www.fortticonderoga.org Fort Ticonderoga], an 18th-century French fortress which overlooks Lake Champlain from Ticonderoga, offers tours, historic galleries, walking trails and gardens for visitors.\n\n==Do==\nImage:Montcalm Point on Lake George.jpg|thumb|300px|Montcalm Point on Lake George\nThe region is famous for winter sports, particularly downhill skiing. Lake Placid is in the unusual position of having hosted not one but two Winter Olympiads, in 1932 and again in 1980. The Olympic ski competition took place at Whiteface Mountain, near Wilmington (New York) and other Olympic facilities can be found in Lake Placid.\n\nThe many huge, open spaces appeal to outdoorspeople, where the many lakes and streams draw fishermen, canoeists and nature lovers.\n\nLive theatre venues include the [http://www.atfestival.org Adirondack Theatre Festival] in Glens Falls, the [http://www.pendragontheatre.org Pendragon Theatre] in Saranac Lake, the [http://depottheatre.org Depot Theatre] at the Westport rail station and the [https://www.lakeplacidarts.org/ Lake Placid Center for the Arts], a year-round performing and visual arts facility.\n\nSightseeing tours are available on lake boats in Old Forge.\n\n==Buy==\nImage:Adirondack chair 25.jpg|thumb|Adirondack chair\nVarious traditional crafts and rustic wooden furnishings are manufactured in the region.\n\nThe '''Adirondack chair''', originally a \"Westport plank chair\" designed by Thomas Lee in Westport (New York)|Westport, New York in 1903 and patented by carpenter Harry Bunnell in 1905, is simple in design. One plank of hemlock, pine or cedar is cut into eleven pieces and assembled onto a simple wooden frame as a distinctive outdoor chair which tilts slightly back. The patents for the chairs, popular among cottagers, have long expired; woodworkers in many faraway places (including a few Amish communities) have readily adopted the basic designs. While there have been endless knockoffs, ranging from Ontario's \"Muskoka furniture\" of similar construction to the mass-market composite, resin or recycled plastic imitations which turn up at hardware and lumber dealers nationwide, some of the original wooden chairs are still made in the region and shipped far and wide.\n\nAs the handful of villages within the park boundary are small (typically fewer than 5000 people each), most of the local merchants are small independents. The closest major shopping mall is the Champlain Centre in Plattsburgh.\n\n==Eat==\nAs fish and game are abundant, culinary options can be as local as smoked venison, roast duck, and fresh rainbow or brook trout caught in the Adirondacks and cooked over an open camp fire. Locally-harvested maple syrup can also be had in season.\n\nConversely, everything from Asian or Italian cuisine to Tex-Mex can be had from various local restaurants in the villages. The area around Saranac Lake and Lake Placid, once the home of the \"Great Camps\" of New York City's wealthy and powerful elites, offers various opportunities for fine waterfront dining and eateries in all price ranges.\n\n==Drink==\nFood and drink establishments are plentiful in the various small villages within the park boundary. There are a few [http://visitadirondacks.com/attractions/breweries-and-wineries wineries], microbreweries and cider makers in the region, as well as a distillery.\n\n==Sleep==\nGet a tent, sleep almost anywhere.\n\n* \n\nAnother option is to stay in any of the villages within the park boundary, which typically offer the full standard range of accommodations from bed and breakfast or small independent motels or hotels to the name-brand chains or the luxury lakeside resorts around Lake Placid, Lake George, Saranac Lake, Old Forge, Schroon Lake and the St. Regis Lakes.\n\n==Stay safe==\nThere is very little crime in the Adirondacks. Still, be vigilant when driving alone at night on back roads. Think twice before stopping the car for strangers on the road. As anywhere, the road conditions can be dangerous in the winter months. In all seasons, be on the lookout for deer on the road.\n\nThe most common problem is travelers going into the wilderness without proper experience or equipment. There is prevalent wildlife throughout the Adirondacks, and interactions between humans and wild animals are common.\n\nIn some areas, bear resistant canisters are required. Check the areas where you are staying to see if this is the case.\n\n==Go next==\nOne can take a ferry across Lake Champlain to get to Burlington (Vermont)|Burlington, a lively college town and the biggest city in Vermont.\n\nCentral New York and the North Country are also nearby, as is Saratoga Springs. To the south, the Erie Canal and American Industry Tour both pass through the Albany (New York)|Albany state capital region.\n\nOne could also continue northwest into the Thousand Islands or north into Canada. Montréal is relatively easy to reach from Plattsburgh and Ottawa-Gatineau less than an hour's drive from Ogdensburg. Ontario's Algonquin Park is the closest provincial park of comparable size and scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Adrar is the Tamasheq word for mountain while Ifoghas is the name of a Tuareg clan which lives in the region, the French so named it to differentiate from their (long-held) Adrar in Mauritania. The area is home to a surprising number of animals, including gazelles, antelopes, hyenas, jackals, snakes, &amp; lizards. It contains some very scenic desert landscapes, including granite outcrops, eroded sandstone, gueltas (similar to an oasis, but less \"green\" around them), rock paintings, petrified wood, and even an ancient river valley.\n\n==Understand==\nImage:Rocher dans massif de Timidjileline 01.JPG|thumb|250px|Rock formation.\nThe Adrar des Ifoghas is a remote part of the Sahara with plenty of remnants to evoke its ancient, non-desert past.\n===Settlements===\n*Abeibara &amp;mdash;\n*Aguelhok &amp;mdash;\n*Essouk &amp;mdash; called by some the \"cradle of the Tuareg\" this tiny town was once a prospering town along trans-Saharan trade routes from the 9th to 12th centuries CE; rock painting dating to 8000 BCE can be found, although little remains of its ancient past. Legend holds that Boctou, founder of Timbuktu, was born here.\n*Tessalit, [http://www.tessalit.info/], a town of a couple thousand Tuareg which serves as the border post for the small amount of traffic between Mali &amp; Algeria; the town has some gypsum and ancient salt mines.\n*Tin-Essako &amp;mdash;\n\n==Get in and around==\nThe only way into the region is via 4x4 (although Tessalit has a rarely used airstrip). Given the remoteness of the region, it is best to hire a guide who has an understanding of the region and knows where all the main sights are. Trips can be organized out of Kidal, you best bet to find one is inquiring at the hotels: Mount Krutel (285 00 90), Hotel Campement les Dattiers, or Chez Catharine. Two Tuareg-run travel agencies can be found in Kidal:\n*'''Affala Voyages Initiatives''' ([http://www.affala.com], tel: 285 00 92)\n*'''Timitrin Tours''' ([http://www.mali-tour.com/])\n*'''Azaouad Voyages'''\n\n==See==\nImage:Tinifagh intedeni.jpg|thumb|250px|Rock paintings.\n*'''Tilemsi Valley''' &amp;mdash;\n*'''Rock paintings''' &amp;mdash;\n\n==Do==\n*'''Camel treks''' &amp;mdash;\n\n==Eat==\nBring all the food you will need, as food cannot be purchased outside Kidal. If you stay in a settlement for a night, you may be offered (or can possibly pay for) a meal with a Tuareg family.\n\n==Drink==\nThe Tuareg are Muslim and it would be very insulting of you to bring alcohol! Having three cups of tea with a Tuareg is a classic experience and not to be missed. As for water, bring all the water you will need! The settlements have wells and there are some large gueltas to replenish your water supply, though.\n\n==Sleep==\n==Stay safe==\nDo not underestimate the remoteness! You must have proper supplies for an extended trip into the desert, about a week is necessary to travel from Kidal and spend a few days exploring. Bring two weeks' worth of supplies in case you get lost or caught in a dust storm. Independent travel is highly discouraged and a guide and 4x4 is absolutely essential.\n\nWhen camping (and sleeping) be sure your tent is entirely sealed as most animals, including venomous snakes and scorpions along with hyenas &amp; jackals, are nocturnal. Be very careful when climbing around rocks and any place that is shady and cool, as these are the places where snakes, scorpions, and other animals stay cool during the day. The sand viper buries itself entirely so that only the eyes appear above the sand, while there is a species of scorpion whose venom is more deadly than a cobra! Try to tread carefully to avoid stepping on a viper.\n\n==Go next==\n*Anefis, picturesque town on the edge of the Adrar.\n*Gao, the closest thing to a city anywhere near the Adrar.\n*Kidal, the region's capital\n\n\n\n\n"

                    "text": "\n[http://www.almirantebrown.gov.ar/turismo/adrogue '''Adrogué'''] is a city and capital of the '''Almirante Brown''' partido (district) in Buenos Aires (province) Province in Argentina.\n\n==Understand==\nAdrogué is 23&amp;nbsp;km south of the City of Buenos Aires. With slightly more than 30,000 inhabitants, it stands out as a distinguished residential area, with numerous cobbled streets, lush trees and several squares. In addition, it has an important commercial center, with a variety of shops and bank entities, and a shopping mall.\n\nThe best seasons of the year to visit Adrogué are the spring and the summer, because the city looks really green. The lush trees cast some sort of an arcade over the streets, which makes a beautiful picture. The stillness and peacefulness of the city are an ideal contrast for the chaotic downtown.\n\nAdrogué is not a common tourist destination, but it's worth a visit. The place is safe, but traveling to and from downtown after midnight is just not nice.\n\n==Get in==\n===By train===\nGetting in by train is the easiest way to make your way to Adrogué if you're coming from the City of Buenos Aires. From the ''Constitución'' train station, you should take a train going either to stations ''Glew'' or ''Alejandro Korn'' (normally leaving from either platform 4 or 5). You can get from Downtown Buenos Aires to Constitución using the C line of the subway (subte).\n\nA one-way ticket from Constitución to Adrogué costs ARS&amp;nbsp;0.70 (about USD&amp;nbsp;0.20) and a return ticket costs ARS&amp;nbsp;1.40 (about USD&amp;nbsp;0.40).\n\nThe trip from Constitución to Adrogué takes 28 minutes (it may take longer in the rush hour). Adrogué is the ninth station from Constitución. The order of the stations is: Constitución - Hipólito Yrigoyen - Avellaneda - Gerli - Lanús - Remedios de Escalada - Banfield - Lomas de Zamora - Temperley - Adrogué.\n\nThe first train from Constitución to either Glew or Alejandro Korn leaves at around 05:00 and the last train from Adrogué to Constitución leaves at around 00:00.\n\nIt is not recommended to travel by train as it is usually crowded, and security and cleanliness on the coaches are poor.\n\n===By bus===\nBuses in Argentina are called ''colectivos''. The bus will usually take longer than the train because it makes more detours. However, this will depend on the traffic. The advantage is that buses normally run around the clock.\n\nNear Constitución station you can take any bus 79 except the one which goes to San José (it takes a different route and don't make it to Adrogué).\n\nFrom Correo Central, close to the Pink House, you can take bus 74.\n\nBus 160 will also take you to Adrogué from Ciudad Universitaria (UBA campus), Palermo or Jorge Newbery Airport (Aeroparque).\n\nIn all cases, you should ask the driver to tell you where to get off.\n\nThe ticket costs ARS&amp;nbsp;1.35 (about USD&amp;nbsp;0.40) and can only be paid with coins (no banknotes!). Remember to get some before taking the bus.\n\nGetting to Adrogué by bus may take from 1h15min to 1h30min.\n\n===By Van===\nVans are often called ''Combis'' in Argentina. There is a private Combi service traversing from Teatro Colón in the City of Buenos Aires to Adrogué and beyond. The trip usually costs ARS&amp;nbsp;9.00 and is by far the most comfortable way to travel.\n\nThe trip takes about 1 hr, and may take up to 1 hr 30 min during rush hours. It is also possible to reserve your place in advance.\n- Adrogue Bus (Shuttle Company): 4293-5309\n\n===By taxi===\nA taxi from the City of Buenos Aires (from the Obelisk, for example) to Adrogué costs about ARS&amp;nbsp;80. This is a good option if you're visiting Adrogué in a group of 3 or 4 people. The trip may take from 50 minutes to 1 hr 15 min depending on traffic conditions.\n\n===By car===\nYou can go from the Obelisco in Buenos Aires to Adrogué taking 9 de Julio avenue to the south, then 9 de Julio Sur freeway, and taking Pavón/Yrigoyen avenue. Adrogué starts approximately at 12.500 Yrigoyen avenue.\n\n==Get around==\n\n==See==\nIf you are interested in architecture, you'll like the houses in Adrogué. Some nice-looking houses are on Seguí street, for example.\n\nSome of Adrogué's earliest residences are still preserved. They were usually built in French, Italian or English style, and they served as summer houses for many of Buenos Aires wealthiest families between 1870 and 1930. Some of the best examples are the Adrogué Tennis Club, former residence of city founder Esteban Adrogué (Macías &amp; Sánchez streets), the St. Michael's School (Uriburu street &amp; St. Michael's alley)and the former Aráoz Castex residence (Seguí &amp; Avellaneda streets), among others.\n\nThere are many parks and squares. Some squares are actually rotaries. The main square is Plaza Brown. The town hall, the church of Saint Gabriel, and a religious school (Colegio del Carmen) are located opposite to it. Connected to it by diagonals are the Bynnon, Espora, Cerreti and Bouchard squares. The square next to the train station is Plaza San Martín.\n\nIn the commercial area there's the so-called House of Culture (''Casa de la Cultura''), with different expositions and plays.\n\nThe Boulevard shopping mall is located in Adrogué. You can get there with bus 318 (will leave you close to it) or by taxi (''remise'').\n* \n\n==Do==\n\n==Buy==\n\n==Eat==\n* \n*'''Artisanal Ice Cream Riviera''', Esteban Adrogué 1180. both bar and icecream parlor, is one the most important companies in the region. They produce high-quality icecream, desserts and chocolate at competitive prices. They are open all through the year (except for the chocolate shop, which closes during the summer). Locals usually get together for an icecream (it's not uncommon to have a quarter kilo, which costs ARS&amp;nbsp;6.00). The flavor ''dulce de leche granizado'' is a must.\n* \n*As a snack, you can try the alfajor ''Capitán del espacio'' (blanco), one of the preferred ones by the locals. It costs about ARS&amp;nbsp;0.50 and all the kiosks sell it.\n\nThe restaurants are located in or close to the commercial center, which in turn is located a few meters east of the train station. All of them offer good service, good-quality food and fair prices. Some of the most renowned restaurants are:\n* '''Trote''' bar &amp; restaurant, ''Esteban Adrogué 1107, Paseo la Delicia'', is one of the most important restaurants in Adrogué, and is surrounded by a beautiful garden.\n* '''María Bonita''' pizza and restaurant, ''Mitre 1195'', a very nice and popular place.\n* '''La Zorra''', the pasta they serve is said to be really good.\n* \n* '''Tirifilo el Bodegon''', in the corner of Spiro and Cordero. Spaniard (Tapas, Paella, Cazuela, Pulpo a la gallega), some Argentinian traditional dishes ( Locro on national holidays), and our own Porteño flavor (Puchero on Tuesday nights) . A new must in the Adrogue station area.\n\n==Drink==\nAll the restaurants also serve drinks and work as bars. There are also many pubs and bars like La Maja, Bernie's, Franz, Cándida, Havanna, Satchmo's, La Bikina, La Colorada and more. There are also a few tea houses.\n\n==Sleep==\n*  \n\n==Connect==\n\n==Go next==\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Liberty Lines also run from Marsala to Favignana and Marettimo. The first ferries leave for Favignana between 07:00 and 07:30. The last ferry departs Favignana for Trapani at 20:00. The last ferry to Marsala leaves at 17:00. Tickets can be purchased from kiosks at the port. Arrive early for the evening return ferries, particularly on the weekends, as they sell out at times. Fares are between  and  each way.\n\nSeveral operators run all-day excursions to the islands from Trapani. Typically they visit two islands, giving you time to spend on the islands, and stops in bays where you can swim off the boat, with lunch provided on board. Prices are around  for excursions to Favignana and Levanzo, and  to Favignana and Marettimo. The boats leave from the part of Trapani port between Via XXX Gennaio and Via Rallo and you can buy tickets there or at other outlets around the old town.

It's little wonder that much of ancient art and philosophy—from Aristotle to Homer, many were citizens of cities along this coast—was developed in this land of wine and honey, which has a favourable climate year round.\n\nDuring the Roman Empire|Roman era, Aegean Turkey and the neighbouring parts of Central Anatolia constituted the '''Province of Asia''' (hence \"the Seven Churches of ''Asia''\", see #Seven Churches of Asia|below). The name of the province was later extended to include Asia|all of the continent that lies to the east.\n\n'''The climate''' is Mediterranean, and often very typically so; hot, dry summers (around 30-35°C during the day, 1-2 days of rain a month), warm transitional seasons, and mild, wet winters (around 10-15°C during the day, 8-16 days of rain a month). There is still some climatic variance within the region, however. Cities further inland have chillier winters, with some possibility of snow; while also contending with summers featuring daytime temperature averages over 35°C.\n\n==Talk==\nTurkish phrasebook|Turkish is the main language in the region. Native Greek speakers of Crete|Cretan origin formed the majority in many coastal areas, but since the 1980s, the links with Crete are more folkloric than linguistic.\n\nAs tourism is one of the main industries of the region, finding someone who can communicate in English or German phrasebook|German to a lesser degree is generally not a problem.\n\n==Get in==\n\n* Most of the tourism-oriented towns have direct '''bus''' services from many other important centres of the country, such as Istanbul.\n* The major '''airports''' of this region are located in/near Izmir, Bodrum, and Dalaman. All handle a number of international flights as well as much more frequent domestic (national) flights.\n* Most large hotels, tour operators and car rental companies located in the provinces of Izmir and Bodrum.\n* All major coastal towns have '''ferry''' links with the nearest East Aegean Islands|Greek islands.\n* Major hub of the region for '''rail''' transport is Izmir.\n\n==Get around==\n\n== See ==\n\n\n\nThe Aegean has the highest concentration of '''ancient city''' ruins in Turkey, which should be no surprise given that this was the heart of the Greek '''Aeolian''' and '''Ionian''', and indigenous '''Lydian''' and '''Carian''' civilizations. Expect to come across with another set of ruins as close to each other as every 10 or so kilometers. Some, such as Ephesus—very possibly the best preserved ancient ruins in all of the Mediterranean basin, except for Pompeii—still exhibit much of their former glory, while others may not seem to be offering much more than a pile of collapsed marble columns at first sight. In addition to Ephesus, other likely contenders to be on the checklist of many travellers to the region include Assos, Bergama|Pergamon, Miletus, and Didyma, but some often overlooked sites such as Sardis, and Aphrodisias are also well worth a visit. Besides, as most of the still-inhabited cities and towns in the region are merely modern versions of ancient cities (it's hard to find a city ''younger'' than 3000 years old in the region after all), it's always possible to see yet another unexpected bit of ancient ruins, even within a city as modern-looking as Izmir.\n\nWhen the fatigue from visiting one ancient city after another sets in, it might be time to look for '''medieval Seljuk and Ottoman architecture''' that some of the Turkish regions are known for. However, the scorched earth policy of the retreating Greek army in the final days of Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922, or the War of Independence as known in Turkey, left many Aegean towns in rubbles, and the concrete-mania of the following decades didn't certainly help either. Regardless, the often unexplored inland village of Birgi southeast of Izmir is one of the places that happily escaped such destruction, and its Çakıroğlu Konağı, a three-storey mansion that is colourfully painted inside-out is a rare treat for architecture enthusiasts. It may also be possible to visit the odd '''mosque''' that dates back to the days of the Turkish frontier principalities (which rose to power after the central Seljuk authority vanished with the Mongol invasion in the 13th century), which has a unique post-Seljuk, yet pre-Ottoman transitionary style, one great example being the İsa Bey Mosque in Selçuk. Fans of '''neo-classicism''' are luckier, as the coastal towns that used to be inhabited by the Ottoman Greeks and have been full of neo-classical buildings were left intact—Ayvalik|Ayvalık, Foça, Alaçatı, and Çeşme are the towns that you should head to if this is what you are after.\n\nSo many years of wars and invasions mean that the '''castles and citadels''' are an unmissable mark of the regional landscape. Those that are in Bodrum, Kuşadası, and Çeşme quite form the symbol of their respective towns, while the small picturesque castle of the coastal village of Çandarlı, surrounded by well-manicured grasses, is one of the main attractions of the surrounding area. However, if you are looking for something really impressive and really off-the-beaten path, head for Babakale (\"the father castle\"), which has been proudly standing on the westernmost tip of the Asian mainland for centuries.\n\n=== Seven Churches of Asia ===\n), one of the least visited of the septet]]\n\nAegean Turkey played a major role in the development of early Christianity, and of particular note are the '''Seven Churches of Asia''': Ephesus, Izmir|Smyrna, Pergamon, Akhisar|Thyatira, Sardis, Alaşehir|Philadelphia, and Denizli|Laodicea.  While the prophecies didn't refer to physical churches, and only Pergamon, Ephesus, and Philadelphia have Roman-era churches remaining, all of these cities have ruins of some kind, and Sardis has the ruins of a synagogue.  Apart from Izmir (Smyrna), which doesn't have much in the way of Roman ruins, but is one of Turkey's major cities, the most popular of these cities are Ephesus and Pergamon, with Sardis and Laodicea coming in far behind, and Akhisar (Thyatira) and Alaşehir (Philadelphia) are almost never visited by tourists (except the handful seeking to see the Seven Churches).  While Akhisar and Alaşehir's Roman-era ruins are minimal compared Ephesus, Pergamon, Sardis, or even Laodicea, these cities are still interesting to visit, as they remain local farming centers, with strikingly different feels.\n\nAll of these cities except for Pergamon can be reached (or the nearest city, no more than a 20&amp;nbsp;minute minibus ride away can be reached), by train, however except for Selçuk (Ephesus) and Denizli (Laodicea) the trains run only a few times a day, and the schedules may be inconvenient.\n* Selçuk and Denizli can both be reached by the regional Denizli-Izmir train. Minibuses, taxis, or a long walk will be required to reach both sites from their associated cities.\n* Sardis (Sart on the schedule) and Alaşehir can be reached by the regional Izmir-Uşak train.  The train station for Alaşehir is in the center of two, while the location of Sart station seems to be slightly over a kilometer from the gymnasium complex. \n* Akhisar can be reached by the either the 6 Eylül or 17 Eylül express between Izmir and Bandirma, each of which runs only once a day.  The station itself is seven blocks, or about 400&amp;nbsp;meters, from the ruins.\n\nIt is also possible to take buses or minibuses between the cities.  In Izmir, the buses run to each of these cities at intervals ranging from every half hour (Bergama/Pergamon) to every two hours (Alaşehir). It's likely that buses between the other cities will be less frequent, so if you plan to make a loop around Izmir, ask at the bus station when the buses to your next city run.\n\n==Do==\nWith its long craggy coastline, finding somewhere for a '''swim''' is rarely a daunting task in the region. As for the related '''watersports''', some towns are better suited to them than some others; for example the waters of Alaçatı are good for windsurfing.\n\nWith the Mediterranean climate in charge, and the latitude being more southern than most of Europe, there is not much room for '''wintersports''' in the region (in coastal locations, it only snows once, and lightly, every decade—this is why the locals find the pictures of the amphitheatre of Ephesus under snow so magical and make them into postcards). While the snow-hungry residents of Izmir flock to Mount Sipylus near Manisa at every opportunity to witness the snowfall, that particular mountain does not really receive that much as to let skiing or doing other snow-related sports. For these, it may be more worthwhile to head more inland to Mt. Bozdağ, or ancient Mount Tmolos between Salihli and Ödemiş, which, with its mountain lake, is beautiful regardless the season.\n\nWhen it comes to '''thermal waters''', the Aegean is less known as a destination than some other Turkish regions. Two places of note may be Çeşme | Ilıca, which has hot springs discharging from the sea floor inside natural rocky pools, and much more famous Pamukkale, which offers the unique experience of swimming amidst toppled ancient columns lying at the bottom of a thermal water-filled pool, which has been continuously in use for millennia.\n\n==Eat==\n\n==Drink==\nWhile viticulture is a big business in the agricultural interior of the region, most of the produce is of the Sultana variety, which is not processed into wine, but rather exported as dried raisin. Nevertheless, a number of towns around Denizli has some level of fame for their '''red wines''' which often have a strong flavour, while the village of Şirince is well-known nationwide for its wines produced out of just about any fruit that can be imagined.\n\nOne drink that is unique to the region is the '''''sübye''''' of Tire, oddly made of melon seeds.\n\nWhile some of the inland towns might be a little bit more conservative than those on the coast, you are never too far away from a bottle of ''Efes'' '''lager''' whenever you are thirsty in the region.\n\n==Go next==\nIf the sea, sun, and ancient cities here are not enough, why not moving on southeast to Mediterranean Turkey?\n\n\n\n"

                    "text": "\n\n'''Aegina''' (Greek: Αίγινα) is one of the '''Saronic Gulf Islands''', a triangle 11 km on each side. It's the closest island to Athens, reached in barely an hour by ferry, and in 2011 had a population of 13,056. The main reasons to visit are to escape the city heat for an agreeable old port, and to see the temple of Aphaea. It feels more like a beach suburb than a Greek island, and it can get busy, but most visitors are from the city. \n\n== Towns and villages ==\n\n* '''Aegina''' is also the name of the main town and ferry port - and to avoid confusion it's referred to as \"Aegina town\" on this page. It's mainly geared for day-trippers, with some accommodation but lots of restaurants, and the Temple of Apollo is 500 m north. \n* (Σουβάλα) is the main village of the beach and resort strip along the north coast.\n* (Αγία Μαρίνα) is a small harbour on the east coast near the Temple of Aphaea. \n* (Πέρδικα) is a resort village near the south tip of the island.\n\n== Understand ==\nIn legend Aegina was a goat-nymph, though it was almighty Zeus who acted the prize goat with his predatory sex adventures. Aegina was carried off to the island that now bears her name (maybe not unwillingly) and bore Zeus a son Aeacus, who became king. Hera the wife of Zeus tended to blame the other women rather than her hubby, and wiped out the island population by plague. However Aeacus prayed to Zeus to convert the teeming ants into humans, the myrmidons, a sort-of warrior caste - honestly, how many of us would have thought of doing that?\n\nIn the 7th to 5th centuries BC Aegina was a maritime trading state and its currency, embossed with a sea turtle and later a land tortoise, circulated widely in the Hellenistic world. Trade rivalry with Athens escalated into war, the island suffered a massacre in 424 BC, and this time the trick with the ants somehow couldn't be repeated. Aegina lost its importance and fell under the sway of other city-states, passing (as did Athens) into Roman, Byzantine, Venetian and Ottoman control. It has some agriculture but little industry, and has long been a holiday retreat for Athenians.\n\n== Get in ==\nFrequent ferries ply from Piraeus port in Athens to Aegina town. Hydrofoils for foot passengers take 40 min, single fare €14, conventional vessels for cars and motorbikes take 70 min, single fare €10.\n\nIn normal times hydrofoils sail hourly 07:00-17:00, some continuing from Aegina to Agistri, Poros or Methana. In April 2020 only conventional vessels are sailing once or twice a day, reserved for residents and essential visitors and not available to tourists. The ferry operators are [http://www.hellenicseaways.gr Hellenic Seaways], [https://alphalines.gr/en/ Alpha Lines],[https://www.anes.gr/en ANES Ferries] and [https://www.sf.gr/ell/ Saronic Ferries].\n\n is at the heart of the town. Ferries dock on the west pier, cruise ships on the east pier, and small craft use the inner harbour. There's lots of nearby cafes.\n\nDirect ferries from Athens (Piraeus port) to Souvala and Agia Marina were axed in 2019.\n\n== Get around ==\n\nThere are five car rental agencies near the harbour, which also have motorbikes and scooters - book ahead to ensure availability. Some of their offerings are dilapidated.\n\nFor a day trip, you might do better to hire a taxi. The driver knows the roads, where to park and how much time to allow to return you to the ferry pier, and will regale you with what his great-grandmother got up to during the war.\n\nBuses on the island are a limited service to enable villagers to get into town for essentials then get home. They are not well-designed for sightseeing outings, but it's possible given boundless patience. The three routes all start from the bus stand by the harbour, and take at most 30 min to the end of the line. A single ticket is €2, pay cash as you board. Destinations are only shown in Greek but if in doubt, get on and ask the driver.\n: - Route 1 (yellow) follows the north coast, Aegina town - Kipseli - Vathi - Souvala - Agii - Vagia, with three M-F and two Sa Su.\n: - Route 2 (blue) runs east across the island, Aegina town - Agios Nektarios - Aphaia Temple - Agia Marina. These run M-F with three outbound buses passing the temple. Two others turn off after Agios Nektarios along the lane via Alones to Agia Marina and don't pass near the temple, but they return that way, so there are five return services.\n: - Route 3 (orange) follows the coast southwards, Aegina town - Faros - Marathonas - Aeginitissa - Perdika, with three M-F and two Sa Su.\n\n== See ==\n\n* \n* '''Churches''' worth a look in town are St Nicholas Chapel (on west pier, the whitewashed building just as you step off the ferry), Isodia Theotokou (which you'll see even earlier from the boat, as it looms over the harbour), the Cathedral (on Mitropoleos) and Fanomeri (1 km inland and underground; it's often closed). \n* '''Landmarks''' and secular buildings in town are Government House (next to the cathedral, a modest 2-story building that in 1828/29 housed the newly independent Greek government until they could get set up in Athens), Eynardio (1830 building next to the cathedral), Tower of Markellos (a pink watchtower on Thomaidou) and the Kapodistrian Orphanage southside (looking uncannily like a prison, which it was). \n* \n* The writer Nikos Kazantzakis (1883-1957), best known for ''Zorba the Greek'', lived on-and-off in Aegina from 1933 and built an idiosyncratic house on the northwest tip 200 m north of the Kapralos museum. It's now a private dwelling and you can't tour inside.\n\n*  along the road to Agia Marina is a large, elaborate, modern Orthodox church and monastery. It's dedicated to Metropolitan St Nektarios (Anastasios Kephalas 1846-1920), a monk who ministered in Cairo, Libya and Athens before retiring to Aegina. From the church, a path leads uphill to Paleochora (Old Town), the island's earlier capital with Byzantine architecture. \n* , on a hilltop in the middle of the island, is reached by a lane winding south from Agios Nektarios. It's nowadays a convent, open 07:00-14:00 and 16:00-18:30.\n* \n* '''Agios Minas''' is a small convent 300 m southwest of the Temple of Aphaea, visitors welcome.\n* There are dozens more churches across the island: look out for Agios Christophoros, Agia Anastasia, Pachia Rachi, Agia Ekaterina, and Omorphi. \n* '''Perdika''' is a fishing village on the north prong of a peninsula at the southwest tip of the island. Most of it is nondescript modern breeze-block, but there's a pleasant cafe strip by the harbour and a scenic lane round the headland, with views towards Epidaurus. The south prong is scrub grazed by goats and donkeys, and officially off-limits. At the end of it, a cylindrical building is a 360-degree camera obscura: wait five minutes for your eyes to adjust within, and the whole landscape slowly appears on the round wall, upside down.\n*  is the bosky island just west of Perdika, 1 km long and reached by a 10-min water taxi. There's a beach bar at the landing point but it's otherwise uninhabited. The deer will come looking for handouts.\n*  off Aegina's northeast tip is the other island, a wooded 100 m place flanked by two smaller outcrops, and seldom visited. ''Zoodochos Pigi'' there is not a menagerie for wild boar but a modern church: it means \"life-giving spring\" and is a common Greek place-name.\n\n== Do ==\n \n* '''Beaches:''' the best are Souvala on the north coast, Agia Marina to the east, Marathonas 5 km south of Aegina town, and Perdika.\n* '''Climb''' the highest peak on Aegina at 532 m, helpfully called ''Oros'' which is Greek for \"mountain\". It's 5 km southeast of town, follow Lefkis road towards Anitseo. The well-marked path leads past the remains of a temple to Zeus and takes 45 min. From the top there's a panorama over the Saronic Gulf.\n* \n\n== Eat ==\n* Aegina town waterfront is lined with cafes. Good choices are '''Flisvos''' north of the pier (daily 10:00-00:00) and '''Pantarei''' on the harbour (daily 07:30-03:00).\n* Agia Marina has '''Pita Tom''' (daily 12:00-00:00), where souvlaki and gyros are fresh and inexpensive.\n* Perdika, at the southwest tip of the island, has a whole row of good tavernas.\n* Vagia has \n\n== Drink ==\n* Perdikiotika at 38 Apheas in Aegina town has charming decor and casual food.\n* Bartan and Barrera are on Irioti north end of Aegina harbour, with Belle Epoque on Pileos a couple of blocks inland.\n* The rest of the island doesn't do free-standing bars, head for one of the waterfront tavernas.\n\n== Buy ==\n\n* Aegina pistachios (φιστίκια, fistiki) are distinctive and have PDO status - \"Protected Designation of Origin\". The shell is paler and a bit more closed than, say, US cultivars. The kernel is red-green with an intense sweet taste. Buy them at any wayside kiosk; try them with salt and lemon juice to balance the sweetness.\n* The fish market is in a pungent alley by the harbour. It's open daily 06:00-21:00.\n\n== Sleep ==\n* The main accommodation strip starts north of Aegina town and straggles along the coast through Souvala to Vagia. Other clusters are around Agia Marina and Perdika.  \n* \n* \n* \n\n== Stay safe ==\n\n* Take care with sun protection and keeping hydrated - the sea breeze is cooling so you don't realise how sun-frazzled you're getting.\n\n== Connect ==\nAs of Aug 2022, Aegina town has 4G from all Greek carriers, but the signal becomes patchy 3 km out. You might pick up 5G from Pireaus on the ferry.\n\n== Go next ==\n* Most routes mean taking the ferry back to the mainland. Pireaus port is worth a few hours of your time before heading into Athens|Central Athens.\n* Seasonal ferries continue from Aegina town to the island of Agistri and to Poros and Methana on the Epidaurus mainland.\n\n\n\n\n"

This diverse group of volcanic islands used to be off the beaten track, but they are becoming more popular and can be very busy during July and August. The islands are inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nImage:Aeolian_islands.jpg|thumb|Aeolian Islands: Lipari and Salina from Vulcano\n\n==Regions==\n\nImage:Aerial image of Stromboli (view from the northeast).jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Stromboli\n\n\n|region1items=\n|region1description=the main island and the main town (called Lipari as well) is the transportation hub, with plenty of hotels and makes a good base.\n\n|region2name = Vulcano (Sicily)|Vulcano\n|region2color=\n|region2items=\n|region2description=right next to Lipari, this island is dominated by the ''Gran Cratere'' volcano cone giving off clouds of sulphurous gas.

Those involved in the tourist trade may also speak some English, German, or French. Cellular telephone coverage is dependable in the settled areas, but access to the internet is rare. There are a few internet cafes in Lipari Town.\n\n==Get in==\n\nThere are frequent car ferries and much quicker hydrofoils from Milazzo and Messina on Sicily, and from Reggio di Calabria on the mainland, to and between the islands. Most call first at Lipari, and then proceed to the other islands. Ferries are frequent in summer, with fewer during spring, autumn and winter and a reduced service year-round on Sundays. For timetables see [http://www.siremar.it SIREMAR], [http://www.usticalines.it Ustica Lines] and [http://www.ngi-spa.it/ NGI]. Check the timetables in advance, and allow plenty of time for connections, as boats can be early or late.\n\nA few car ferries a week also continue on to Naples (see [http://www.snav.it SNAV]) and during the summer hydrofoils run from Naples, Cefalù, Palermo and Messina.\n\nThe Aeolian Islands are quite remote, which is part of their appeal. No air travel is available to the archipelago, except for the very expensive helicopter service which runs during high season from the Catania airport. For more information see [http://www.airpanarea.com/ Air Panarea] or [http://www.helijet.it HeliJet]. Most international travellers, then, will arrive at the airport of either Palermo or Catania airport in Sicily, or Reggio di Calabria, across the straits of Messina on the mainland.\n\nAlthough the Reggio airport is relatively near the port, boats from Reggio are infrequent. Likewise, only a few ferries per day run from Palermo during high season, and the airport is far from the city. These ports are best used by the traveller who is already in Italy, as is Naples, a much longer boat trip that is convenient for travelers arriving by plane or train in Naples from points north. For the traveller arriving directly from abroad, numerous budget airlines have routes from around Europe to Catania. From there, one can take the train, or an express bus, to Messina, connecting to a boat; or, at Messina, one can connect to a second train or bus to Milazzo, which has by far the most boat departures. Although it is convenient to change trains in Messina, the Milazzo train station is a few miles from the port. On the other hand, the bus from Catania arrives at the train station, while the bus for Milazzo departs from a separate bus station a few blocks away. Ask for help at the information booth outside the train station. One express bus per day departs from Catania airport for Milazzo, but arrives there so late as to miss the boat for certain of the islands. You may wish to spend the first night in Lipari, with its charming town, and then depart for the outlying islands. As another alternative, the car rental agencies have special deals allowing the traveller the use of a car one-way from Catania to Milazzo - inquire in advance as these deals may not be available without reservations. The car rental agencies in Milazzo are a few blocks from the port. Cars can be left for a few days easily in Milazzo when visiting the islands, just park them in any parking place with blue borders (blue border indicates no parking fee or time limit on parking)\n\n==Get around==\n\nThe larger islands, Lipari, Vulcano and Salina have quite good bus services. Timetables are available at the tourist offices in each island's port. Those islands also have scooters for rent, and are the only of the islands with comprehensive systems of roads. Panarea and Stromboli are small enough to have no roads or automobiles to speak of; Panarea in particular is completely accessible by foot. Alicudi and Filicudi are so remote that they have little in the way of developed tourist industries or infrastructure. On those islands, transport from the port, and scooter rental, should be arranged with one's innkeeper. Boat rental is also popular for touring the periphery of each island; although the small boats for rent are not adequate for travel between the islands, but are popular for the excursion from Panarea to the islets of Basiluzzo and Drauto.\n\n==See==\nVulcano is the first port of call for ferries from Milazzo.  As well as the spectacular view of the narrow channel between this island and neighbouring Lipari, you're also greeted with the strange sight of a stack of sulphurous oozings, right by the harbour, with an accompanying smell!  Disembarking, you can follow the road between that stack and a huge red rock, sulphurous fumes hissing out of the side of the pavement, to one of the island's main attractions.  Next to the beach, the locals have created a hollow in the volcanic clay that is filled with yellow mud.  After bathing in the mud, you can swim in the sea and wash it all off.  Swimming here is a very special experience, because the fumaroles extend right out into the sea, bubbling up hot gas and giving the sensation of being in a jacuzzi, in the blue Mediterranean!\n\nThe other main attraction on Vulcano is, you guessed it, the volcano!  A steep climb from the town, you can walk to the summit of the island for a spectacular view of the other Aeolian Islands.  If you have closed footwear, you can traverse the active vents on the north side of the main crater on your way to the top.  Here, a great deal of steam and smelly gas is given off, and you can observe large sulphur crystals in the vents.  Be careful not to burn your feet on the hot rocks and steam.\n\nLipari is relatively pedestrian in comparison with exotic Vulcano.  Fortunately, it has less exotic prices, and the large main town has a nice old quarter and a decent quota of non-tourist shops.  Among the attractions on Lipari is the pumice quarry, reached from the main town by an infrequent bus service.  This is right by the sea, and has a nice rocky beach where, interestingly, many of the rocks tend to float off into the sea!\n\nStromboli is the most spectacular of the islands, as it's the only one that is volcanically active. In fact, it's the only volcano in the world that is known to have been continuously active throughout recorded history.  The approach by ferry from Lipari takes one past the sheer sides of the island that rise towards the summit crater, which is permanently shrouded in clouds of its own making.  Stromboli town has pretty narrow streets and, further from the centre, beautiful black sand beaches in rocky coves.  The must-see attraction is the night-time climb up to the crater.  The going is tough (you will be climbing approximately 850 m) but you will see an amazing sunset and the eruptions are incredible.  The trip is rounded off by running down the volcanic ash slopes, in the dark!\n\n==Do==\nMost visitors to Vulcano spend time in the mud baths near the port.  Entry is inexpensive and free in the low season. You may find it worthwhile to purchase a token for the shower.  The water gives you a powerful sulphurous odor which lasts for a few days or even weeks.\n\nAbout 20 m from the mudbaths there's also volcanic activity out in the sea. The effect is that the water in the sea is literally boiling.\n\n==Eat==\n\n==Drink==\n\n==Stay safe==\n\n==Go next==\n\n\n\n\n\n"

                    "text": "\n\n\n\n'''Afghanistan''' is a landlocked country at the crossroads of Central and South Asia. The country shares borders with Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Iran, Pakistan, China, and the disputed Kashmir territory. \n\nOnce the centre of many powerful empires, the country has been in chaos and turmoil since the 1970s. Political unrest is rampant, and the country suffers from many social problems, such as war, drought, a public health crisis, terrorism, corruption, warlordism, poverty, and low literacy rates. \n\nHowever, under less extreme circumstances, this vast, mountainous country offers a lot to the adventurous, thrill-seeking traveller. Its landscapes are simply majestic, the history lover can appreciate numerous historical sites from all eras, and the architecture lover can feast their eyes on such wonderful Islamic architecture. There's even a shrine that houses a cloak once worn by Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam. \n\nAfghanistan is a melting pot of cultures, with Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, and Uzbeks constituting the largest ethnic groups. Islam is the state religion, hence the name \"Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan\". A majority of Afghans are Sunni Muslims, although about 20% of them are Shia Muslims.\n\nUnder less dire circumstances for the country, tourists might find themselves being treated as celebrities here; in fact, they might be showered with a lot of hospitality and care, even if they unintentionally make a few cultural blunders.\n\n==Regions==\n\n\nThe south and east are predominantly Pushtun and the Hindu Kush mountain area has many Hazara, but all regions have considerable mixing of ethnic groups.\n\nEnglish spellings of Afghan place names vary as there is no regulation of names when written in the Latin script.  For example, Q may replace K as in Qandahar or Qunduz. Kunduz will be seen spelled as Konduz, Qunduz, Qundoz, Qundoze and variations on these. Bamiyan is often spelled as Bamian or Bamyan. Khowst may be spelt as Khost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==Cities==\n*  - in the east, the capital and largest city\n&lt;!-- capital top, alphabetise the rest --&gt;\n*  – once one of the greatest cities in the region and capital of ancient Bactria. Although much of it lies in ruins, the remaining architectural and cultural elements are little changed since Alexander the Great set foot there.\n*  - The remains of the Buddhas. Once considered one of the wonders of the world, these tall stone carvings were destroyed by the Taliban in a notorious act of cultural vandalism.\n*  - in the south-east, between Kabul and Kandahar\n*  - in the west, gateway to Iran, has a strong Persian influence and several interesting historical sites\n*  - in the east, between Kabul and the Khyber Pass\n*  - a very conservative city in the south. Known as the home of the Taliban. \n*  - a major city in the northeast, and crossing point to Tajikistan\n*  - home to the impressively tiled Blue Mosque, and the staging point for trips into Uzbekistan. Ethnically diverse, Mazar is considered the most liberal city in the country after Kabul.\n\n==Other destinations==\n*  – 5 stunningly turquoise lakes in a remote and beautiful setting not far from Bamiyan\n*  – the gateway to India and historic route of invasion and trade\n*  – well off the beaten path but some say worth the journey – possible as a roundtrip from Herat or when traversing the Central Route from Herat to Kabul\n*  - an isolated mountain area with its own culture\n*  – a beautiful trekking area leading to the famous Anjuman Pass\n*  – a high mountain pass and tunnel linking Kabul to the north\n*  – a green plain north of Kabul that produced a lot of the food for central Afghanistan. From Kabul it extends north through Charikar, Parwan province to Jabal os Saraj.  The Taliban destroyed the irrigation systems and it is just beginning to recover.\n*  – one of Afghanistan's most isolated areas, with soaring mountains and unique culture\n\n==Understand==\n\n from a hill in 2009]]\n in Bamyan province]]\n\nAfghanistan has been in the news since the late 1970s for all the wrong reasons. While visiting has not been advisable for many years, it has much to offer the intrepid traveller. However, even the more adventurous tourists should consider looking elsewhere for thrill-seeking.\n\n===History===\n, adjacent to which is the mausoleum of Ahmad Shah Durrani and the site of the Prophet Muhammad's Cloak]]\n\nAfghanistan borders Persia, Central Asia and South Asia, and various Silk Road routes cross it to connect those regions. It has been described as \"the crossroads of Asia\" and has history of trade going back to before 2000 BCE.\n\nThe country has a long history of conflict – raiding and banditry, battles between tribes, and resistance against invaders including several Persian Empires, On the trail of Alexander the Great|Alexander the Great, the Arabs during the great expansion of Islam (starting with their capture of Herat in 652 CE and spread over several centuries), the Mongol Empire in the 13th century, and the British Empire in the 19th. Its recent history is no exception: the Soviet Union invaded late in the 20th century and a U.S.-led coalition invaded early in the 21st.\n\nThe Afghans have given all invaders trouble; the country has been so difficult to conquer that it is known as the ''Graveyard of Empires''.\n\nThe modern-day country was founded by secession from the Persian Empire in 1709. Since then, there have been several dynasties  and at times the Afghans ruled what are now Iran, Iraq, most of Pakistan and parts of India. Mohammed Zahir Shah was the last king, ruling from 1933 until 1973, when the constitutional monarchy was overthrown in a coup and the country became a republic.\n\n\n\nIn the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a buffer state in the \"Great Game\" between the British Empire and the Russian Empire. After the Second Anglo-Afghan War Britain gained control of Afghanistan's foreign relations as part of the Treaty of Gandamak of 1879. In 1893, the ethnic Pashtun and Baloch territories were divided between Britain and Afghanistan by the Durand Line, which forms the modern-day border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Afghanistan became fully independent from the British in 1919.\n\nIn the 1960s and early 70s, Afghanistan was a popular destination for adventurous travellers, part of the \"Hippie Trail\" Istanbul to New Delhi overland route. Dirt cheap, culturally fascinating and with plenty of excellent hashish; what more could a hippie want? However, it has not been anywhere close to safe since the Russian invasion of 1979. \n\nA coup in 1978 brought a socialist regime to power, but they were by no means universally accepted; some of their officials and Soviet advisers were killed. The Soviet Union invaded in December 1979 to support the regime and a long messy war ensued, with the Soviet and their Afghan government allies on one side and several groups known as the Mujahedeen on the other. The Mujahedeen were armed and funded mainly by the United States, Saudi Arabia, other Gulf Arabs, Iran and China, and many were trained in Pakistan. By February 1989, all Soviet forces withdrew from the country, and the Soviet Union collapsed two years later in 1991.\n\nAfter the Russians left, the country was somewhat chaotic, apparently reverting to its tribal past with no effective central government and various Mujahedeen leaders ruling separate fiefs and sometimes fighting each other. '''Taliban''' (lit. ''students'') &amp;mdash; made up primarily of ethnic Pashtuns and inspired by the fundamentalist Islam#Deobandi|Deobandi interpretation of Sunni Islam &amp;mdash; emerged as a political force in the early 90s, heavily backed by (some would say created by) Pakistani Intelligence and largely funded by the CIA, to end \"warlordism\" and bring security to the country. They seized Kabul in late 1996 and controlled most of the country by 2000, aside from some areas in the northeast.\n\n'''Al-Qaeda''' (translated, ''the base'') began in 1988 as a group of mostly Arab volunteers aiding the Mujahedeen; like Taliban they were supported in the 90s by Pakistan and the U.S., but they also got considerable Arab support. By 2000 they were led by the Saudi Osama bin Laden, and guided by the very strict Islam#Wahhabism|Wahhabi interpretation of Sunni Islam.\n\nAl-Qaeda would later orchestrate the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States. The U.S. government demanded that the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden and other Al-Qaeda militants for trial in a US court. Taliban refused, though they did offer to try Osama in their own shariah court if the U.S. government shared \"solid evidence\" of his alleged guilt with them, and also expressed willingness in principle to consider extraditing Osama to a third country for a trial before a shariah court there. The U.S. refused to share whatever evidence they had with the Taliban and considered the Taliban's offers insufficient, so they and their allies chose to take military action with support from anti-Taliban Afghans — mainly Tajik, Uzbek and Turkmen warlords from the north of the country who fought in the Northern Alliance — causing the Taliban regime to fall in December 2001.\n\nThe same month, representatives from all ethnic groups of Afghanistan met in Germany and agreed to form a new government with Hamid Karzai as Chairman of the Afghan Interim Authority. Following a nationwide election in 2004, Hamid Karzai was elected as President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. A year later, in 2005, legislative elections were held and the country's parliament began functioning again. In addition to occasionally violent political jockeying and ongoing military action to root out anti-government elements, the country sufferred from widespread election fraud, poverty, corruption, and opium cultivation.\n\nIn 2021, the United States and other NATO countries withdrew their troops, and the Taliban seized control of most of the country. The U.S.-backed Afghan government swiftly collapsed, and the Taliban formed a new government. Though active fighting between different armed forces appears to have greatly decreased since then, terrorism, such as from the Islamic State organization, is still a problem. A more pressing issue is shortages of food and other goods due to drought and sanctions that were imposed due to the overall human rights situation and especially the draconian restrictions the Taliban imposed on women, who are now not permitted to go to university and allowed to hold jobs in very few professions.\n\n===People===\nAfghanistan is an ethnically diverse country. Tribal and local allegiances are strong, which complicates national politics immensely. The largest ethnic group is the Pashtuns, followed by Tajiks, Hazaras, Uzbeks and others.\n]]\nBaloch tribesmen, still largely nomadic, can be found anywhere between Quetta in Pakistan and Mashad in Iran, including much of western Afghanistan. They make marvellous Carpets#Baluchi_rugs|rugs, if somewhat simple.\n\nHazaras in the central mountains look much more similar to East Asians than other Afghans do. According to some theories, they are descended from Mongol Empire|Genghis Khan's Mongol soldiers.\n\nThe two largest linguistic groups speak Pashto and Dari (Afghan Persian). Pashto speakers predominate in the south and east, Dari in the north, west and central Afghanistan. About 11% of the population have Turkic languages such as Uzbek or Turkmen as their first language. Many of them live in the north, near the borders with Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Minor native language groups include Nuristanis, Pashais and Pamiris, found in small pockets in the east and northeast.\n\nThere are also thousands of Hindus and Sikhs living in different cities, but mostly in Kabul, Jalalabad, and Kandahar.\n\n===Climate===\nTemperatures in the central highlands are below freezing for most of the winter, and snow is common at higher elevations. Summertime highs in lower elevations (such as Jalalabad or Mazar-e Sharif) can exceed 50°C/120°F. In higher areas such as Kabul, summer temperatures can be 30°C/90°F and winter around 0°C/30°F.  The most pleasant weather in Kabul is during April, May and September.\n\n===Terrain===\nMostly rugged mountains; plains in north and southwest. The Hindu Kush mountains run northeast to southwest, dividing the northern provinces from the rest of the country, with the highest peaks found in the northern Wakhan Corridor. South of Kandahar is desert.\n\nThe lowest point is Amu Darya at 258 m, and the highest is Nowshak at 7,485 m.\n\nAfghanistan is bordered by Pakistan to the south and east, Iran to the west, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan to the north. There is a short border with China to the far northeast, but in extremely inaccessible terrain.\n\n===Electricity===\nOfficially 220 V 50&amp;nbsp;Hz. Electricity supplies are erratic, but slowly improving in major cities. Voltage can drop to below 150 V in some places. The Afghans' enthusiasm for homemade generators or modifying low quality ones means that the frequency and voltage can also vary wildly.\n\nThere are three types of electrical outlets likely to be found in Afghanistan. They are the old British standard BS-546 and the newer British standard BS 1363. But the European standard CEE-7/7 \"Schukostecker\" or \"Schuko\" is the standard and the most common. Generally speaking, Canadian and Americans should pack adapters for these outlets if they plan to use North American electrical equipment in Afghanistan. You may also find cheap universal adapters in the local markets, but make sure you have an understanding of electrical systems and the nature of adapters.\n\n===Read===\n* Special:Booksources/0864426046|''A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush'' by Eric Newby — a hilarious account of pioneer trekking in Nuristan in the 1950s\n* Special:Booksources/0156031566|''The Places in Between'' by Rory Stewart — a fascinating post 9/11 travelogue of Stewart's walk from Herat to Kabul just after the fall of the Taliban.\n* Special:Booksources/1594480001|''The Kite Runner'' by Khalid Hosseini — a beautiful and heartbreaking tale of childhood in Afghanistan\n* ''Good Morning Afghanistan'' by Waseem Mahmood — a true account of the setting up of the first public radio station in Kabul after the Taliban fell.\n*''An Unexpected Light: Travels in Afghanistan'' by Jason Elliot — a travelogue from the period between the expulsion of the Soviets and the ascension of the Taliban. He went everywhere.\n*''For a Pagan Song'' by Jonny Bealby — a brilliant account of the author's journey to retrace the footsteps of Rudyard Kipling's heroes in ''The Man Who Would Be King'' to discover the land of Kafiristan (now Nuristan) and the people who inhabit the region.\n* The Flashman Papers#Flashman|''Flashman'' — a hilarious historical novel recounting the disastrous 1842 retreat from Kabul during the First Anglo-Afghan War\n\n==Talk==\n\n\nThe official languages of Afghanistan are '''Dari phrasebook|Dari''' (an Afghan dialect of Persian phrasebook|Persian), which serves as the country's lingua franca, and '''Pashto phrasebook|Pashto''', spoken by the largest and most influential ethnic group, the Pashtuns. According to the CIA World Factbook, 78% of Afghans speak Dari, and 50% speak Pashto. Many Afghans are bilingual in those two languages.\n\nYou're more likely to find a Pashto speaker in areas close to the border with Pakistan than anywhere else. There are also some speakers of Urdu along that border and of Persian along the border with Iran.\n\nAs Afghanistan is a diverse, multi-ethnic country, hundreds of languages are spoken throughout. Some of the most commonly spoken minority languages include '''Uzbek phrasebook|Uzbek''', '''Turkmen phrasebook|Turkmen''', '''Pashayi''', '''Balochi phrasebook|Baloch''', and '''Nuristani'''. \n\nAlthough English is taught from the fourth grade, very few Afghans speak English. According to the CIA World Factbook, less than 5% of all Afghans speak English. You're likely to find an English speaker in the capital city, Kabul. A solid knowledge of Dari and Pashto is essential for the daring, independent traveller.\n\nThanks to the influence of Indian cinema and cordial relations between the central government and India, a sizeable number of people can speak and understand '''Hindi'''. Approximately 2% of all Afghans speak '''Urdu'''. You're likely to find speakers in Kabul.\n\nThe literacy rate in Afghanistan is low.\n\n==Get in==\n\n===Visas===\n'''All visitors''' need to apply for a visa in advance. The Taliban does not accept visas issued by embassies and consulates that are run by the previous U.S.-backed government, meaning that visas issued by Afghan diplomatic posts in Western countries will not be accepted. Most tour companies include a stop in Dubai or Peshawar for you to obtain your visa. You can determine the political alignment of an Afghan diplomatic post based on its official name; embassies and consulates of the \"Islamic Republic of Afghanistan\" are run by the previous U.S.-backed government, while those of the \"Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan\" are run by the Taliban. Tourist visas are one-month single-entry for all countries. There is no online application process, and you will have to make your way to the consulate in person to apply for your visa. Bring with you four passport-sized photos (two for your visa application, and two to hand to immigration when you arrive in Afghanistan) and two colour photocopies of your passport's data page. For most travels to Afghanistan you need to have a detailed itinerary explaining the nature of your visit and places you intend to visit. Some consulates may also demand a letter of invitation, which tour companies can obtain for you.\n\n===Customs===\nDrones are ''illegal'' in Afghanistan. Do not attempt to bring one in.\n\n===By plane===\n'''Kabul International Airport''' () in Kabul is the main entry point to the country. As of 2024, the airlines based in out of Kabul include flag carrier '''[https://www.flyariana.com/ Ariana Afghan Airlines]''' and the privately-run '''[https://www.kamair.com Kam Air]'''. Neither the airlines nor the airport are up to international safety standards.\n\n===By car===\nThere are a number of roads into Afghanistan:\n* From Peshawar, Pakistan, via the Khyber Pass to Jalalabad, in the east. See above for details.\n* From Quetta, Pakistan, to Kandahar, in the south. This crossing is ''closed'' to third-country nationals.\n* From Mashad, Iran to Herat, in the west. This border is open to foreigners.\n* From Termez, Uzbekistan to Mazar-e Sharif, in the north. This border is open to third-country nationals.\n* From Tajikistan to Kunduz, in the northwest. The security situation at this border was not considered conducive to passage as of 2019.\n\nAs of mid-2023, none of these routes were considered safe.\n\n===By bus===\nBuses run regularly between Jalalabad and Peshawar, Pakistan. Also, between Herat and Mashad, Iran. Afghani buses are thoroughly checked by Iranian border police for possible drugs, so expect delays.\n\n=== By train ===\n\nAfghanistan has never had a national railway network and while there are a few spur lines from neighboring countries, most notably to Mazar-e Sharif, there were no passenger trains as of 2020. However there are several border towns with passenger trains, from where it's possible to continue into Afghanistan on foot or by taxi.\n\nAcross the border from Northwest Afghanistan, the city of Termez in Uzbekistan sees trains from both Moscow and Tashkent. From Pakistan, it's possible to take a train from Quetta to the border town of Chaman and continue into South Afghanistan.\n\n==Get around==\n===By plane===\nFlag carrier '''[https://www.flyariana.com/ Ariana Afghan Airlines]''' and  '''[https://www.kamair.com Kam Air]''' both operate flights between Kabul and Kandahar.\n\n===By car===\n]]\n\n\nAs of 2007, there was a network of public transportation between the country's cities. Buses plied some routes and Toyota vehicles had a near monopoly on minivan (HiAce) and taxi (Corolla) transportation.\n\nA highway connects Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif. The highway goes through the Salang Pass and across the Hindu Kush mountain range. Another highway links Kabul to Kandahar.\n\nThere were no metered taxis in large parts of Afghanistan. As of 2011, taxis were yellow and clearly identifiable. You were expected to strike a deal with the driver before entering the cab.\n\nJeeps and Land Cruisers were available for hire, as of 2011, along with drivers who spoke some English. There were tour operators in Kabul that could have provided a car and guide; these people were available for hire at Kabul International Airport. Petrol stations were scarce in the countryside, and fuel was expensive.\n\nPaved roads are the exception, not the rule, and even those roads can be in poor repair. Once outside the major cities expect dirt roads (which turn to mud during rain or snow melt).\n\n==See==\nWhile ongoing violence has put an almost full stop to tourism in Afghanistan, the lack of visitors has nothing to do with the country's sights. This is a land full of mystical attractions, telling tales of ancient times and offering beautiful Islamic architecture, medieval city quarters and unexpectedly stunning nature.\n\nSeveral sites are listed on World_Heritage_List#Afghanistan|UNESCO's World Heritage List. Most famous of course, were the ancient '''Buddhist sculptures of Bamiyan'''. The Taliban destroyed most of the 6th century statues in a cultural crime that outraged the world. Today, what remains in the Bamiyan valley is the silencing and still worthwhile sight of the empty niches. The salvaged pieces of what were once the largest statues of their kind in the world continue to provide a fascinating insight in the history of this place.\n'''Band-e Amir National Park''', with its six interlinked lakes, is perhaps the finest natural attraction. At an altitude of 2900 meters, the blue waters in this protected natural area almost seem unreal against the sandy mountain sides that surround them.\n\nExcellent mosques are to be found all around, with particularly grand examples in '''Mazar-i-Sharif''' and in the rapidly developing '''Herat'''. The '''Jam|Minaret of Jam''', just north of Herat, is UNESCO listed.\n\n==Do==\n\n==Buy==\n===Money===\n\n\nThe '''Afghani''' ('''AFN''') is the currency of Afghanistan, denoted by the symbol \"'''Afs'''\" or \"'''؋'''\" (ISO code: '''AFN'''). The current version of the afghani was introduced in 2002, with 1 afghani equal to 1,000 of the previous afghanis.\n\nBanknotes of Afghanistan are issued in denominations of 1-, 2,-, 5-, 10-, 20-, 50-, 100-, 500 and 1,000 afghanis.\n\n===Carpets===\n\n\n\nAfghanistan's most famous products are carpets and there are some fine deals to be had, though good haggling is absolutely required to get them.\n\nThere are carpets described as \"Afghan\", but also at least two other carpet-weaving traditions. The Baluchi tribes in the south and west weave fine rugs, and the Turkoman tribes in the north do as well; both groups are also found in neighbouring countries.\n* Carpets#Afghanistan|Afghan rugs are generally made in city workshops, mainly for the export trade. They are often large; 3 x 4 metres (10 x 12 feet) is common. Most are quite coarsely woven to keep costs down, but others have a fairly fine weave. If you need a big rug for the living room at a moderate price, these are likely to be your best choice. Beware, however, that a large thick (because coarsely woven) carpet may be expensive to transport because it will be quite heavy.\n* Carpets#Baluchi_rugs|Baluchi rugs are usually small since nomadic people cannot use large looms; sizes up to 1.5 by 2 metres (4 x 7 feet) are common, but not many beyond that. They are popular with travellers, partly because they are fairly portable. One very common type is a prayer rug, just large enough for one person to kneel facing Mecca. Another is the \"nomad's chest of drawers\" &amp;mdash; a bag, often beautifully decorated, that is a saddlebag when travelling and hangs on the wall of the tent when camped.\n* Carpets#Turkoman_rugs|Turkoman rugs, often labelled \"Bokhara\" in the Western rug trade, come in all sizes and a very broad range of quality. Some are woven by nomads, with the same range of sizes and types as Baluchi rugs. Others are made in city workshops; the best of these are almost as finely woven and almost as expensive as top-grade Persian carpets. One fairly common design is the Hatchli, a cross shape on a large rug.\n\nAll three types tend to use geometric patterns in the design, usually with red as the background colour and with repeated elements called \"guls\" to make the pattern. Generally, these are not as finely woven as carpets from the cities of neighbouring Iran. However, many of them are quite beautiful and their prices are (assuming good haggling) well below those of the top Iranian carpets.\n\nIt is fairly common for rugs woven by nomads &amp;mdash; such as many Baluchi rugs and some Turkoman &amp;mdash; to show minor irregularities. The loom is dismantled for transport and re-assembled at the new camp, so the rug may not turn out perfectly rectangular. Vegetable dyes are often used, and these may vary from batch to batch, so some colour variation (''arbrash'') occurs and this may be accentuated as the rug fades. To collectors, most such irregularities fall into the \"that's not a flaw; it's a feature\" category; they are expected and accepted. In fact, a nice arbrash can considerably increase the value of a rug.\n\nTurkoman designs are widely copied; it is common to see \"Bokhara\" carpets from India or Pakistan, China produces some, and the Afghan carpet designs show heavy Turkoman influence. To collectors, though, the original Turkoman rugs are worth a good deal more. Good Baluchi rugs are also quite valuable in Western countries. Afghan rugs, or lower grade Baluchi and Turkoman rugs, generally are not collectors' items; most foreigners will find the best buys among these. Experts might pay premium prices for the top-grade rugs, but amateurs trying that are very likely to get severely overcharged.\n\n'''Kilims''' are flat-woven fabric with no pile. These are nowhere near as tough as carpets and will not survive decades on the floor as a good carpet will. However, some are lovely, and they are generally cheaper than carpets. Smaller items, such as  purses, made or decorated with carpet and kilims are common.\n\n===Sheepskin coats===\nAnother common product and popular souvenir is the Afghan sheepskin coat. These have the wool on the inside for warmth and the leather on the outside to block wind, rain and snow. They often have lovely embroidery. Two cautions, though.\n\n* The makers use the embroidery to hide flaws in the leather; top-quality coats will have little or no embroidery.\n* Australian customs have been known to incinerate these coats on arrival, to protect their large sheep population from diseases (notably anthrax) that poorly tanned Afghan products might carry. They might not be the only country that will do this.\n\n===Guns===\n\n\nGuns are very common in Afghanistan and some may be of considerable interest to historians and collectors.\n\n* \n* \n\nBefore the Russian invasion of 1979, most Afghan men carried rifles, but jezails were much the commonest type and single-shot pass rifles second; owning a repeating rifle was a major status symbol. Today most Afghans have automatic weapons – mainly Russian AK-47 or American M16 – so the older guns are readily available for any traveller who wants one.\n\nGuns make rather problematic souvenirs. Recreational shooting|Importing a firearm anywhere can be difficult and it may be impossible in some places. If you are travelling overland and passing through several countries before you reach home, it is almost certainly not worth the trouble. Also, if you actually fire any Afghan gun, there is a risk that it will blow up in your face.\n\n===Other goods===\nThere are also various bits of '''metalwork''' – heavily decorated pots, vases and platters, and some quite nice '''knives'''.\n\n==Eat==\n\n\nThere are three main types of Afghan bread:\n\n* '''Naan''' — Literally \"bread\". Thin, long and oval shaped, its mainly a white/whole wheat blend. Topped with poppy seeds, sesame seeds, nigella seeds, or some combination of these. Upon request, customers may be able to get all white flour and a helping of oil, which makes it rich and delicious.\n* '''Obi Non''' — Uzbek-style bread. Shaped like a disc and thicker than naan. Usually made with white flour.\n* '''Lavash''' — Very thin bread. Similar to the lavash elsewhere. Usually used as plating for meats and stews.\n\nRice dishes are the \"king\" of all foods in Afghanistan. The Afghans have certainly taken much time and effort in creating their rice dishes, as they are considered the best part of any meal. Wealthier families will eat one rice dish per day. The Afghan royalty spent much time on rice preparation and invention as evidenced in the sheer number of rice dishes in their cookbooks. Weddings and family gatherings must feature several rice dishes and certainly reputations can be made in the realm of rice preparation.\n\n* '''Kabuli Pulao''' (or Kabuli Palaw, Qabili Palaw, Qabili Palau or simply Palau) — An Afghan rice dish consisting of steamed rice mixed with lentils, raisins, carrots, and lamb. It is baked in the oven and topped with fried sliced carrots and raisins. Chopped nuts like pistachios or almonds may be added as well. The meat is covered by the rice or buried in the middle of the dish. It is the most popular dish in Afghanistan, and is considered the national dish.\n* '''Chalao''' — White rice. Extra long grains such as Basmati is required. First parboiled, then drained, and finally baked in an oven with some oil, butter, and salt. This method creates a fluffy rice with each grain separated, unlike Chinese or Japanese rice. Chalao is served mainly with qormas (korma; stews or casseroles)\n* '''Palao''' — Cooked the same as chalao, but either meat &amp; stock, qorma, herbs, or a combination are blended in before the baking process. This creates elaborate colors, flavors, and aromas for which some rices are named after. Caramelized sugar is also sometimes used to give the rice a rich brown color.\n* '''Yakhni Palao''' — Meat &amp; stock added. Creates a brown rice.\n* '''Zamarod Palao''' — Spinach qorma mixed in before the baking process, hence 'zamarod' or emerald.\n* '''Qorma Palao''' — Qorm'eh Albokhara wa Dalnakhod mixed in before the baking process\n* '''Bore Palao''' — Qorm'eh Lawand added. Creates a yellow rice.\n* '''Bonjan-e-Roomi Palao''' — Qorm'eh Bonjan-e-Roomi (tomato qorma) added at baking process. Creates a red rice.\n* '''Serkah Palao''' — Similar to yakhni palao, but with vinegar and other spices.\n* '''Shebet Palao''' — Fresh dill, raisins added at baking process.\n* '''Narenj Palao''' — A sweet and elaborate rice dish made with saffron, orange peel, pistachios, almonds and chicken.\n* '''Maash Palao''' — A sweet and sour palao baked with mung beans, apricots, and bulgur (a kind of wheat). Exclusively vegetarian.\n* '''Alou Balou Palao''' — Sweet rice dish with cherries and chicken.\n* Sticky Rices — Boiled medium grain rice cooked with its meat, herbs, and grains. Because the water is not drained, it forms a sticky rice texture. Notable dishes include Mastawa, Kecheri Qoroot, and Shola. When white rice is cooked to a sticky consistency it is called bata, and is usually eaten with a qorma, such as Sabzi (spinach) or Shalgham (turnips). A sweet rice dish called Shir Birenj (literally milk rice) is often served as dessert.\n\n'''Qorma''' is a stew or casserole, usually served with chawol. Most qormas are onion-based. Onions are fried, then meat is added, as are a variety of fruits, spices, and vegetables depending on the recipe. Finally water is added and left to simmer. The onion caramelizes and creates a richly colored stew. There are over 100 qormas.\n\n* '''Qorma Alou-Bokhara wa Dalnakhod''' — onion based, with sour plums, lentils, and cardamom. Veal or chicken.\n* '''Qorma Nadroo''' — onion based, with yogurt, lotus roots, cilantro, and coriander. Lamb or veal.\n* '''Qorma Lawand''' — onion based, with yogurt, turmeric, and cilantro. Chicken, lamb, or beef.\n* '''Qorma Sabzi''' — sauteed spinach and other greens. Lamb\n* '''Qorma Shalgham''' — onion based, with turnips, sugar; sweet and sour taste. Lamb.\n\n\n\nPasta is called \"khameerbob\" in Afghanistan and is often in the shape of dumplings. These native dishes are wildly popular. Due to the time-consuming process of creating the dough for the dumplings, it is rarely served at large gatherings such as weddings, but for more special occasions at home:\n\n* '''Mantu''' — A dish of Uzbek origin. Dumplings filled with onion &amp; ground beef. Mantu is steamed and usually topped with a tomato-based sauce and a yogurt or qoroot-based sauce. The yogurt-based topping is usually a mixture of yogurt, sour cream, and garlic. The qoroot based sauce is made of goat cheese and is also mixed with garlic. Sometimes a qoroot and yogurt mixture will be used. The dish is then topped with dried mint.\n* '''Ashak''' — Kabul dish. Dumplings filled with leeks. Boiled and then drained. Ashak is topped with garlic-mint qoroot or a garlic yogurt sauce and a well seasoned ground meat mixture.\n* '''Afghan kebab''' — Most often found in restaurants and outdoor vendor stalls. Sometimes they are put into shishas. Families rarely serve homemade kebab in their home due to the need of inaccessible equipment. The most widely used meat is lamb. Recipes differ with every restaurant, but Afghan kebab is usually marinated with a blend of spices, and served with naan, rarely rice. Customers have the option to sprinkle sumac, locally known as ghora, on their kebab. The quality of kebab is solely dependent on the quality of the meat. Pieces of fat from the sheep's tail (jijeq) are usually added with the lamb skewers to add extra flavor.Other popular kebabs include lamb chops, ribs, kofta (ground beef) and chicken; all of which are found in better restaurants.\n* '''Chapli kebab''' — A specialty of eastern Afghanistan, is a fried hamburger. The original recipe of chapli kebab dictates a half meat (or less), half flour mixture, which renders it lighter in taste, and less expensive.\n* '''Bolani''' — Made in a very similar way as Mexican Quesadilla.\n* '''Lahndi''' — Also known as dried meat, a famous winter dish of Pashtun cuisine popular in amonɡst Pashtuns in Afghanistan , mostly reɡions with dry and cold weather. Consumption of lahndi is common during the winter months.\n\n'''Desserts and snacks'''\n* '''Baklava'''\n* '''Afghan Cake''' (similar to pound cake sometimes with real fruit or jelly inside)\n* '''Gosh Feel''' (thin, fried pastry covered in powdered sugar and ground pistachios)\n* '''Fernea''' (milk and cornstarch very sweet, similar to rice pudding without the rice)\n* '''Mou-rubba''' (fruit sauce, sugar syrup and fruits, apple, sour cherry, various berries or made with dried fruits \"Afghan favorite is the Alu-Bakhara\")\n* '''Kulcha''' (variety of cookies, baked in clay ovens with char-wood)\n* '''Narenge Palau''' (dried sweet orange peel and green raisins with a variety of nuts mixed with yellow rice glazed with light sugar syrup)\n\n== Drink ==\nSince Afghanistan is an Islamic country, alcohol consumption is illegal.\n\n==Sleep==\nHotels and guesthouses are available in all major cities, and while some may not meet international standards they are usually friendly and reliable.\n\n==Work==\nEveryone contemplating work in Afghanistan should read and understand the travel advice published by their respective governments and in the #Stay safe|Stay safe section below.\n\nPrior to the recapture of Afghanistan by the Taliban, many foreigners found well-paid work in Afghanistan as part of the reconstruction efforts, often with the UN or other non-governmental organisations. Most of these jobs were within Kabul. Local wages were very low, especially outside of Kabul.\n\n==Stay safe==\n\n\n\n\n\nAfghanistan is a volatile and dangerous country. '''Non-essential travel is strongly discouraged'''. Banditry is somewhat of an ancient tradition in many parts of the country, including in the northern areas. Foreigners may be targets for kidnapping.\n\nMilitant groups have an active presence in the country. They have strongly anti-Western views, making visits especially dangerous for Westerners.\n\nWar zone safety#Land mines and unexploded ordnance|Landmines and other UXO (Unexploded Ordnance) remain a problem across the country, so plan to stick to well-worn paths, avoid red and white painted rocks, and do not touch or move any suspicious-looking item. Hundreds of people are injured or killed every year in accidents due to landmines and UXO. \n\nInsects and snakes are also something to be careful of, and the mountainous country has many vicious tiny creatures such as scorpions, spiders, centipedes, and bees.\n\nIn some areas, altitude sickness is a significant risk.\n\nEarthquake safety|Earthquakes are common. Summers are Hot weather|hot and winters Cold weather|cold. Traveling around the country becomes difficult in winter as snow blocks roads; Snow safety|avalanches are a risk factor.\n\nSince the Taliban takeover, it is illegal for '''women''' to show their faces in public; all women are required to wear the niqab or burqa when in public places. Traveling without a Sex segregation#Muslims|mahram is risky and possibly illegal.\n\nAny homosexual activity is punishable by an assortment of harsh punishments, including death, under Afghan law. LGBT travelers should exercise tremendous discretion.\n\nThe Taliban have a zero tolerance attitude towards '''illicit drugs'''. Possession or trafficking of them will result in arrest and long imprisonment terms.\n\n==Stay healthy==\nAfghanistan has more than its share of health issues, and it is pretty much essential to consult a travel doctor ahead of your trip about vaccinations and health risks. Travellers' diarrhea will afflict most visitors at least occasionally, and other food-related illnesses are moderately common. Respiratory diseases such as tuberculosis are common, and malaria is a risk in many parts of the country. Meningitis, hepatitis, cholera and rabies are major health issues, especially in the countryside with lacking health infrastructure.\n\nAfghanistan is one of the dustiest countries in the world, and you should be prepared to be covered in it and breathing it for most of your stay, even in the major cities. Consider bringing facemasks. Pollution from diesel engines can also make life unpleasant.\n\nFlies are notoriously heinous here, likely due to poor sanitation. Winter brings some relief, but they come back full-strength when spring arrives.\n\nFood should be approached with a discerning eye, as hygiene standards can often be lacking. Hot, freshly cooked food is generally safer. '''Bottled water''' is also advised, unless you have your own purification system.\n\nDo not approach any animals, especially dogs and cats and preferably take a rabies shot before going to the country, it's one of the most rabies-affected countries in the world and finding medical attention and medications will be hard – even with the shot you need to get urgent medical treatment if you get a scratch from an infected animal.\n\nBring any prescription medicine you may need from your home country, and don't count on being able to find it locally. You may also consider carrying pain relievers and Travellers' diarrhea#Medicate|anti-diarrheals, as they'll be hard to find outside of major cities.\n\nSquat toilets are the norm, with toilet paper optional and sometimes scarce. Western-style toilets are seen occasionally in newer buildings and some private homes.\n\n==Respect==\n\n\n]]\n\nAfghans in general are welcoming and hospitable to foreign visitors. Hospitality is a cornerstone of Afghan culture, and it is very likely that you'll be treated as a celebrity by the locals. \n\nWith the regime change in 2021, a large proportion of the population, especially women, are very afraid of what will be in the future. Those who worked for the government, for foreign organisations, for human rights or for the media, or held any high profile positions may be afraid for their lives. Tread extremely lightly.\n\n=== Basic etiquette ===\nIf invited to an Afghan home, expect to be offered the best of everything there is. You will often be showered with tea, sweets, snacks, and gifts when entering someone's home. Don't refuse any of these as it can leave a bad impression on your hosts. You'll often be encouraged by your hosts to take second helpings ad infinitum. If so, take it as a form of respect as it may leave a good impression on your hosts. Cleaning your plate will invite more to be served, while leaving too much may be a sign you didn't care for it. Aim for leaving just a little, announcing you're full, and heavily praising the food.\n\n'''Honor and shame''', otherwise known as \"saving face\" in other countries, are '''very important''' in Afghan culture. No matter how genuine your intentions may be, avoid criticising people in the open and do not make someone feel uncomfortable with your questioning. Be mindful that your actions will be reflected on your counterparts (e.g. Business partners, family members); doing anything perceived as \"shameful\" by Afghans will cause others to view them in a negative way. Be mindful of this and behave accordingly.\n\nWhile the majority of women across Afghanistan still wear the '''burqa''' or '''chadori''', in cities like Kabul and Herat many opt for the Middle Eastern-style hijab. Western women are highly encouraged to wear any type of head scarf (especially outside Kabul). As a general rule, the people get more conservative as you move further south.\n\nThe pace of life in Afghanistan is quite slow. Building relationships and getting things done require you to demonstrate sincere interest as Afghans try to do things in a measured, careful manner. Losing your temper is seen as disrespectful, and it can quickly make people feel uncomfortable.\n\nAs in any other Islamic country, people place a high value on personal privacy. Although Afghanistan may have wonderful photo opportunities, '''do not photograph or record people without their permission''', especially women. Also, taking photographs of anything of strategic importance may be met with suspicion.\n\n'''Be sensitive to the country's current situation'''. Many Afghans have endured a lot due to years of conflict and warfare. Offer sympathy and respect when the opportunity arises.\n\n=== Religious etiquette ===\n\n* Remember to remove your shoes when entering a religious building.\n* Dress modestly and appropriately; not doing so is considered disrespectful. \n* If at all possible, try not to schedule meetings during Ramadan. The workday is shortened, and since Muslims fast, they will not be able to offer you tea, which is a sign of hospitality. Meetings are also not scheduled during prayers. Also refer to travelling during Ramadan.\n* Mosques are sometimes off-limits to non-Muslims so it is always better to inquire with someone before entering.\n\n=== Things to avoid ===\n==== Politics ====\n* Do not discuss '''the Taliban''' — Some support them and others may not dare to criticize them. Any such discussion will put the local in a very awkward situation.\n* Be careful when discussing '''Pakistan''' — The two countries have had a very hostile relationship, while people from the neighboring regions may have strong ties across the border.\n* Be careful when discussing the '''foreign efforts during the former regime''' — Many Afghans feel that the US military did more harm than good, or betrayed Afghanistan by withdrawing. Any such discussions may also risk being interpreted as criticizing the Taliban regime, see above.\n\n==== Personal subjects ====\n* '''Family''' — Many Afghan people have either been separated from their families, have lost family members to conflict, or fear that they might be put into danger if they're spoken about. As a general rule, don't discuss someone's family unless you know the person well. \n* '''Religion''' — Afghanistan has some '''very harsh''' blasphemy laws. You can very easily elicit strong responses by speaking negatively about religion, especially from an agnostic point of view. Also, don't assume that every Afghan is a hard-line Muslim; secular viewpoints are common. On the other hand, hijabs or burqas are traditional clothing in some regions. Someone's preferred style of dress might not reflect their private views.\n\n==Connect==\nFixed line service is available in major cities (digital in Kabul) and mobile phones in most cities. SIM cards are available and international calls to Europe/US typically cost less than USD0.5/minute. Outside of major cities your options are limited to a satellite phone.\n\nAn Afghanistan number should is of the form &lt;code&gt;+93 30 539-0605&lt;/code&gt; where \"93\" is the country code for Afghanistan, the next two digits are the area code and the remaining 7 digits are the \"local\" part of the subscriber number that can be called from within that particular area code using abbreviated dialing.  You need to dial \"0\" in front of the geographic area code (of 20, 30, 40, 50 or 60 for fixed lines) from outside that particular area code (but when still within Afghanistan).\n\n===Mobile phones===\n\nMobile numbers in Afghanistan must always be dialled with all digits (10 digits, including a \"0\" prefixing the \"70n\" within Afghanistan), no matter where they are being called from. The '''70n''' is a mobile prefix, not an \"area code\", as such and the third digit (the ''n'' part) denotes the original mobile network assigned.\nAn example mobile number looks like &lt;code&gt;+93 700-202-496&lt;/code&gt;.\n\n* '''[http://www.roshan.af/ Roshan]''' ''+93'' [tel:79&amp;#x20;997&amp;#x20;1333 79 997 1333].

                    "text": "\n\n'''Africa''' is the wellspring of the human race. The second largest continent in the world in both area and population, it offers the visitor a unique blend of natural wonders, renowned prehistoric sites, numerous and often sprawling remains of several of the world's greatest ancient civilisations, vibrant cultures, remote villages, and modern cities. Africa has shorelines on the Indian Ocean to the southeast, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Red Sea to the northeast, the Gulf of Aden slightly further south, and the Mediterranean Sea to the north. This huge continent is more than 8,000&amp;nbsp;km (5,000&amp;nbsp;mi) across north-south and 7,500&amp;nbsp;km (4,800&amp;nbsp;mi) east-west with some islands even further out and contains many vastly different peoples, religions, and cultures. Africa has more than 50 sovereign countries&amp;mdash;the most of any continent.\n\n in Kenya]]\n\nAfrica's Nile|Nile River is claimed by some to be the longest river in the world (other geographers argue that the Amazon is longer); the Nile runs 6,650&amp;nbsp;km (over 4,100 mi) from Burundi to Egypt. The Congo River in the DR Congo is the second largest in terms of discharge, and the deepest with a depth of over 230&amp;nbsp;m (750&amp;nbsp;ft) in some spots. Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania is the world's tallest free-standing mountain at 5,890&amp;nbsp;m (19,340&amp;nbsp;ft). Lake Assal in Djibouti is the second-lowest point on Earth, the saltiest lake outside Antarctica, and one of the hottest places on Earth. While the first activity most people associate with Africa is safaris, there are endless possibilities for adventure. For example, you can purchase crafts in markets, venture into the Sahara with a Tuareg caravan, visit traditional villages, hike through the jungle to watch gorillas, climb mountains with rugged landscapes and icy peaks, snorkel in the numerous marine parks while feeding fish, relax on tropical islands in the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, snack on exotic treats, paddle down a river in a dugout ''pirogue'' or travel across savanna on a colonial-era railway.\n\nAfrica's cultural diversity cannot be overstated — most countries are internally diverse and there are huge differences between the Muslim countries in the north with their Arab- and Berber-influenced cultures and the sub-Saharan nations, including the rainbow nation of South Africa that has strong European influences in addition to Bantu and other African traditions. It is also the continent with the largest genetic diversity among the population by far: There is far more genetic diversity among Africans than there is between Africans and inhabitants of any other continent. Despite what lacking media coverage might have led you to believe, Africa is not one country but over 50 countries, making it impossible to make generalisations about \"all of Africa\". Partly also due to the nature of colonial borders, most African countries are anything but homogeneous (for example, South Africa has 11 official languages), and culture, cuisine, language, or even the dominant religion may change dramatically within a few hundred kilometres without ever crossing a border.\n\nDespite rapidly growing economies in many places, there are still many pockets of poverty in both the Maghreb and sub-Saharan Africa. While poverty, corruption, and ethnic and religious violence exist in some parts of the continent, large parts of Africa have made impressive progress, with many cities that have growing middle classes and deal with problems such as traffic jams and crowded public transport, rather than the war or famine you might have heard about in some 1980s documentary or development aid commercial.\n\n==Regions==\nMost people outside the continent divide Africa into two regions: the Arabic-speaking North Africa, and everywhere else as sub-Saharan Africa. However, Africa is a very diverse continent, and this division represents a somewhat shallow understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n==Cities==\n\n&lt;!-- THIS LIST IS LIMITED TO 9 CITIES.

However, these views often have their roots in racist pseudoscientific theories used by Europeans to justify slavery and later, colonialism from the 16th to early 20th centuries. While hunter-gatherer societies were indeed widespread in much of the continent, many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa were in fact home to great cities and civilisations dating back to the medieval era. \n\n====From the dawn of humanity to the first empires====\n\n\nEarly precursors to human beings, most notably ''Australopithecus afarensis'' (named for the Afar region in Ethiopia), the species \"Lucy\" belonged to, lived and walked on two feet as early as 3 million years ago. Remains of later species such as ''Homo habilis'' and ''Homo erectus'' (the first hominid to leave Africa, as far as we know) were found in other parts of East Africa such as Kenya, Tanzania and around the Great Lakes. ''Homo sapiens'' (modern humans), most likely originated either in Southern Africa or in East Africa somewhere in what is now Ethiopia or Kenya. The oldest homo sapiens remains to date are about 195,000 years old and were found in Ethiopia but there are also hints that ''Homo sapiens'' may have been present earlier in Southern Africa. Some of the remains of early hominids as well as their tools are on display in various museums in Ethiopia, Namibia and other countries. The Cradle of Humankind is a site in South Africa with plenty of early human fossils.\n\nSee In the footsteps of explorers#Out of Africa for some of the history.\n\nNorth Africa has a recorded history dating back to about 3300 BCE with numerous buildings, ruins, writings, arts, and crafts which have left traces for us to marvel at. The ancient '''Ancient Egypt|Pharaonic civilisation''' based in Egypt was the most enduring and among the most impressive ancient civilisations. Egypt was one of the earliest cultures to build monumental buildings, form a hierarchical state and wage large-scale warfare with standing armies, and was one of the stablest empires in recorded history, frequently surviving and absorbing foreign invaders, immigrants and usurpers and turning them (culturally) Egyptian.\n\nSouth of the Pharaonic civilisation and sometimes in their sphere of influence was the Nubian culture, which had a long history of mutual influence with its northern neighbours and even came to rule over Egypt for a short time. Their most famous remnants are the pyramids of Meroe, Sudan. Another early centre of settled civilisation and later an early centre of Christianity outside the Roman Empire was Ethiopia, where the Aksum|Aksumite Empire reigned between the fourth century BCE and the 7th century CE and served as an important trading partner of both Indian and Mediterranean powers.\n\nToday, the legacy of ancient African civilisations lives on; many of their monuments, temples and cities are well-preserved and have become popular tourist attractions, and museums host their artefacts. Modern Jews believe themselves to be descendants of slaves from ancient Egypt and Ethiopians of all religions believe they are the descendants of the union of the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon (Sheba is thought by most historians to refer to what is now the nation of Yemen, but the queen is said to have also ruled Ethiopia). Yet outside of North Africa, Sudan and Ethiopia, very little is known about African history prior to 1000 CE, as most people were hunter-gatherers (similar to some cultures still found today on the continent), with no writing systems nor lasting structures, arts or crafts, aside from some cave paintings.\n\n====Classical antiquity====\n\n\nThe Phoenicians, based in what's now Lebanon and part of the coasts of Syria and Israel, colonised North Africa, and established the city of Carthage (now a suburb of Tunis). Eventually, the Carthaginian Republic became a separate one, and a rival of the Romans as the dominant power in the Mediterranean. The Romans destroyed Carthage in the Third Punic War in 146 BCE, burning it to the ground.\n\n, Libya can still be found in much of North Africa]]\n\nIn the period after 360 BCE, '''Europeans invaded''' the continent. Alexander the Great conquered what were then the Egyptian parts of the Persian Empire in 326 BCE, founded a Alexandria|city named after him and had himself declared pharaoh. Egypt would come under the rule of one of his generals after Alexander's death and under the Ptolemaic dynasty, Alexandria became one of the leading centres of Jewish, Greek and Egyptian philosophy and culture. It was here that a library holding \"the wisdom of the ancient world\" stood and it was here that the Jewish holy books were translated into Koine Greek. Starting with the Punic wars, the Roman Empire entered the African picture as a major player, and they founded cities such as Leptis Magna, before the partially Hellenised Egypt also became Roman in 31 BCE.\n\nNorthern Africa and later Nubia and Ethiopia were also among the earliest centres of Christianity with the first Christians in the area already by the first century CE, even before Christianity spread to other parts of the Roman Empire. A famous letter exchange of Plinius the Younger (then governor in Carthage) and Emperor Trajan is among the best known sources of documentation on the treatment of Christians in the 2nd century CE. Few documents from this time remain, but evidence suggests that heterodox forms of Christianity such as Gnosticism, which were not in line with the officially sanctioned version practised in Constantinople, were popular in Northern Africa, and Egypt seems to have been a centre of precursors of Christian monasteries and of apocryphal gospels (i.e. religious texts not included in the \"official\" Bible). Gnostic Christianity, which was very prevalent in Egypt starting in the 2nd century CE, was largely crushed there by the 5th century, but left behind important papyri such as the Gnostic Gospels, which were discovered in 1945 in Nag Hammadi, near Luxor in Upper Egypt, and have been translated into many languages. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church also recognises several gospels which are regarded as apocryphal by other churches.\n\n====Muslim conquest====\n\n\nThe '''Muslim invasion''' and the beginning of the '''Arab Slave Trade''' in the 7th century CE changed the cultural landscape of Northern and much of Eastern and Western Africa. The newly formed Islam#The_Caliphates|Arab caliphate conquered North Africa and the Horn of Africa within a few decades. Due to the shrewd policy of nominal toleration combined with taxation for Christians and Jews, the Muslim conquerors were able to pacify and religiously assimilate the conquered areas remarkably fast. Some scholars have suggested that the aforementioned heterodoxy in much of the African provinces of the Roman Empire helped in the easy conquest by the Islamic conquerors who were more tolerant (or at least indifferent) towards forms of Christianity not in line with Constantinople. In the west, Berbers intermarried with the Arab invaders to become the Moorish population that later invaded the Iberian Peninsula. When Damascus was invaded in the early eighth century, the Islamic religious and political centre of the Mediterranean shifted to Kairouan in Tunisia. Their progress was limited only by the dense forests of West and Central Africa and to coastal areas in the East. The last region to come under Muslim influence was that of Nubia (modern-day northern Sudan) in the 14th century. While some of the Christian and Jewish heritage is still visible in Northern Africa, actual followers of those religions have become few and far between and Islam is culturally very dominant from Egypt to Morocco and south to Sudan and the northern parts of Nigeria. While Christianity is shrinking due to conversion and emigration from its erstwhile centres in Egypt and elsewhere, Judaism virtually disappeared in the decades following the establishment of Israel when most Jews left or were forced out. That being said, Jewish communities continue to survive in Tunisia and Morocco, albeit with much smaller populations than before the establishment of Israel.\n\nThe 7th to 9th centuries were a period of significant change to the history of sub-Saharan Africa. In the west, there was a rise of large and powerful inland kingdoms, such as the '''Ghana''' (in Mali &amp; Mauritania, no relation to modern Ghana, capital in Koumbi Saleh), '''Dahomey''' (which lasted until French capture in 1894, now Benin, capital in Abomey), '''Za/Gao''' (in Mali and Niger), '''Kanem''' (in Chad), and '''Bornu''' (in Nigeria). As many of these kingdoms converted to Islam (usually the conversion of a king included the conversion of his subordinates, at least nominally), trans-Saharan trade grew as salt and gold were transported to Libya and Egypt in large caravans – a trade made possible by the introduction of camels from Arabia in the 10th century that would support much of the area from northern Nigeria west to Mali and Mauritania until the 19th century. The introduction of Islam also brought writing to many African civilisations for the first time, with some of their cities eventually growing into major centres of Islamic scholarship. During the 13th-16th centuries, many of these early kingdoms were replaced with new empires, chief among them the '''Mali''' (in Mali, Guinea, and Senegal), '''Kongo''' (in Angola, Gabon, Republic of the Congo and Democratic Republic of the Congo, capital in M'banza-Kongo),  and later '''Songhay''' (in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, capital Gao), '''Ashanti''' (in Ghana, capital in Kumasi) and a plethora of small, single-ethnicity kingdoms and city-states sprouted. Many of Mali's popular tourist destinations, including Timbuktu, Djenne, and Gao, rose to prominence during this period as they became hubs of trade and Islamic scholarship. Mansa Musa, one of the kings of Mali, is often said to have been the richest person in history. The Hausa people in northern Nigeria began organising in walled city states, of which remnants remain in Kano, and would eventually consolidate into the '''Sokoto Caliphate''' (1804-1903), with its capital in modern-day Sokoto. Coastal, forested West Africa remained largely unorganised, with the exceptions of a few Yoruba city-states of Benin City|Benin, Ife and Oyo, along with small Dahomey and Igbo empires all in modern-day Benin and Nigeria.\n\nMeanwhile, Islamic influence and prosperity from '''Indian Ocean trade''' rose in East Africa as ships from Arabia, Persia, India, and as far as Southeast Asia dropped anchor in major ports from Somalia down to Mozambique, bringing spices in return for slaves and ivory. This area, known as the '''Swahili Coast''', would become home to many city-states such as Kilwa Kisiwani, Mombasa and Zanzibar. Between the 7th and 19th centuries, over 18 million people were taken from the region as part of the Arab slave trade – roughly twice as many as the Atlantic slave trade would take to the Americas. Today, that influence remains in the culture and gastronomy of many places, most notably on the Indian Ocean islands such as Zanzibar, Comoros, the Seychelles, and Mauritius, and descendants of these slaves would go on to form the Siddi community in India, who continue to preserve many African traditions despite now speaking Indian rather than African languages.\n\n]]\n\nSouthern Africa remained largely undeveloped, with primarily nomadic hunter-gatherers such as the San people, but it did contain some small kingdoms. The '''Kingdom of Zimbabwe''' (namesake of today's state) was one of the most notable, constructing the greatest stone structures in pre-colonial sub-Saharan Africa at their capital Great Zimbabwe. The Kingdom of Mapungubwe in modern eastern South Africa also left smaller stone ruins. Both profited from the trade in gold and ivory with Arab and Asian merchants.\n\nDespite the spread of Islam, Ethiopia would continue to hold fast as a bastion of Christianity. Among the most impressive examples of Christian architecture dating to this period are the 13th-century rock-cut churches of Lalibela.\n\n====European exploration and early colonialism====\nPerhaps the most pernicious prejudice about Africa is that it is \"poor\". But just a bit of logical thinking shows just how mistaken this assumption is. Why would countless Europeans, Arabs and others have come here, braved tropical disease and hostile locals (who very much did not want to part with their possessions or be ruled by some pith-helmeted buffoon, thank you very much) if Africa had been ''poor''? No, it was and is precisely Africa's wealth – in gold, in spices, in mineral resources, in oil and also the labor of its people – that made and makes it attractive for would-be colonisers. That said wealth has subsequently been siphoned off to the pockets of small elites and colonisers may cause many Africans to be poor, but it does not make Africa poor per se.\n\nWhile a few Genoese, Castilian, and French explorers managed to reach parts of West Africa in the Middle Ages, '''European exploration''' of the continent began in earnest when Prince Henry \"the Navigator\" set out to acquire African territory for Portugal in the mid-15th century. The '''Portuguese''' reached Cape Verde in 1445, and by 1480, had charted the course to and began trade with the entire Guinea coast (modern Guinea-Bissau to Nigeria). In 1482, Diogo Cão reached the mouth of the Congo River, in 1488 Bartolomeu Dias reached the Cape of Good Hope, and in 1498 Vasco da Gama sailed up the eastern coast, where in Kenya his expedition set up a trading post at Malindi before finding a guide to take them to India.\n\nThis voyage established the Cape Route around Africa. The Portuguese set up numerous forts along the African coast and established a highly profitable trade. They initially held good relations with locals, and remained the dominant European power around coastal Africa until the 17th century while Spain, France, and Britain began exploring the Americas.\n\n, Ghana]]\n\nThe lucrative trade and large amounts of gold obtained by the Portuguese lured other nations to the continent. As the demands for labor in the Americas grew, Portuguese sailors began taking shiploads of slaves to the Americas, beginning the '''Atlantic slave trade'''. In the early 17th century, the '''Dutch''' fought the Portuguese to win control of most of their West and Central African ports, some of which (for example, Luanda) would be retaken later, and established a couple dozen forts of their own, notably at Goree Island in Dakar and at the Cape of Good Hope – a port they hoped to use for trade routes to East Asia and which has become modern-day Cape Town. In 1642, the French built their first fort on Madagascar (which they claimed in 1667) and in 1663, the British built their first fort on the continent in the Gambia. Swedish merchants established a fort on Cape Coast, which was later overpowered by the Danish nearby at modern Accra.\n\n====19th-century imperialism====\nIn the 19th century, European attention shifted from establishing coastal ports for trade to fighting one another to colonise the continent and explore its uncharted interior. With slavery abolished by Britain and their strong efforts to thwart slavery around the world, Europe began to look for other sources of wealth on the continent. The most successful European colony, the Dutch '''Cape Colony''', was seized by the British in 1795. Napoleonic France conquered Egypt in 1798, notably discovering the Rosetta Stone, only to be forced out by the British and then the Ottoman Turks. France invaded a significant amount of coastal West Africa and the Barbary states in Algeria, cutting rampant piracy in the region. Accounts of brave adventurers travelling inland to find places such as Mount Kilimanjaro and rumoured \"inland sea\" (the Great Lakes) and city of gold on the Nile sparked a wave of exploration in the mid-century primarily by Jesuit and other  Catholic missionaries in the Southern, Eastern and Great Lakes regions of Africa. Chief among explorers was the British national hero '''David Livingstone''', who as a poor missionary with few porters explored much of Southern and Eastern Africa, flowed down the Congo River from its sources, and sought the source of the Nile. In West and Central Africa, French, Belgian and Spanish explorers ventured into the Sahara to find the legendary Timbuktu and Malian gold mines and the Congo in search of the Pygmies and hairy, large peoples (gorillas) of Greek legend.\n\n\n\nAs accounts of Africa's interior reached Europe, nations and merchants began to view the continent as a major source of commerce and wealth, similar to their Asian exploits, while the philanthropic and missionary class saw a great opportunity to \"Christianise\" and \"civilise\" the \"savage\" people of Africa. With social Darwinism introduced, many countries saw Africa as a great opportunity to establish colonial empires and establish their pre-eminence among other European nations — chiefly Germany, to catch up with other European nations, and France, to regain glories lost in North America and under Napoleon. Britain and Portugal joined this '''Scramble for Africa''' when they saw their interests threatened. In 1885, the '''Berlin Conference''' brought together European colonial powers to carve up the continent into defined colonial territories with many straight lines and no input from any African kingdom or community. Following the Berlin meeting, Italy was designated as a 'protector' over Ethiopia. In 1898, Italy waged an all-out war to colonise Ethiopia and they were defeated at the battle of '''Adwa'''. This was possible because all Ethiopians came together under emperor Menelik II to stand together, more important however was that Ethiopia was armed with European weapons and thus the disparity of arms was not as decisively in the European favour as elsewhere. This marks the first time Africans defeated European invaders, and made Ethiopia the only African country that was never colonised by a foreign power (Liberia, the other country that survived the Scramble for Africa, was a U.S. territory).\n\nAt the same time, disaster was befalling the people of the Congo, a land awarded at the Berlin Conference as the private property of King Leopold II of Belgium, who proceeded to enslave the people and subject them to mass killings and mutilations when unmeetable production targets for rubber were not achieved. Millions of people were killed in a genocide which extended into the 20th century, ending only in 1908 when worldwide criticism forced the king to relinquish his private ownership over the land and it was turned into a Belgian colony under the control of their parliament. Joseph Conrad wrote the novel ''Heart of Darkness'' from his experience as a witness to some of these crimes, which were also condemned in the satirical pamphlet ''King Leopold's Soliloquy'' by Mark Twain and another pamphlet, ''The Crime of the Congo'', by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\n\nColonialism would be devastating to many of Africa's civilisations, with the most notable casualties arguably being Benin City and Kumasi, both of which were great pre-colonial cities that were razed to the ground by the invading British in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many cultural artefacts from both cities, as well as other civilisations, were looted in the ensuing wars, and these are now mostly on display in various museums in the Western world, such as the British Museum in London, the Louvre in Paris, the Ethnological Museum in Berlin and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Debates as to the return of at least parts of the plundered cultural heritage began in the 1970s before fizzling out without concrete results and have started up again in the 2010s and 2020s.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Britain began a series of deadly '''South African Wars''' from their Cape Colony into surrounding African and Boer (white descendants of the Dutch) lands in modern South Africa, which brought '''Cecil Rhodes''' to fame for his vision to unite Africa under British rule from Cairo to Cape Town. There was one World War I battle in German East Africa (Tanzania) which the British lost, although post-war, German possessions were divided among France, Belgium, Portugal and the UK with South Africa ''de facto'' taking over what is now Namibia until 1990. The Union of South Africa was granted independence from the UK in 1930 and the Afrikaner minority voted to become a Republic in 1960 (see 20th century South Africa).\n\nIn the prelude to '''World War II in Africa'''  fascist Italy invaded Ethiopia but was driven out in 1941. The Axis also tried to capture North Africa, but were evicted by the Allies. It was the social changes stemming from the war, in which tens of thousands of Africans fought for their colonial power, and the Atlantic Charter which led to the spread of nationalistic movements after the war.\n\n====Decolonisation and the legacy of the colonisers====\n\n\nThe '''decolonisation''' of Africa began with Libyan independence from Italy in 1951. Colonial powers employed varying means of control over their colonies, some granting natives representation in the government and cultivating a select few civil servants while others maintained a firm grip with an all-European government. In some countries, nationalist movements were quashed and their leaders killed or jailed, while others were able to peacefully achieve independence. In the 1950s, Guinea, Ghana and North African nations gained independence non-violently. In Algeria, France violently fought independence movements until 1963. With the establishment and new constitution of France's Fifth Republic in 1958, French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa ceased to exist, and after a brief \"community\" with France, the countries of these regions gained independence in 1960. By 1970, all but a handful of African nations were at least nominally independent. However, France made its former colonies and in West and Central Africa sign treaties that gave France control over their natural resources and monetary policy, and retains more influence in Africa than the other former colonial powers. The Portuguese bitterly fought to maintain their African possessions until 1975; all but one gained independence through war. Zimbabwe was the last major colony to gain independence from a non-African colonial overlord, in 1980, following a 14-year period of rule by a white minority government not recognised by Britain, the former colonial power. In 1990, semi-autonomous Namibia gained independence from South Africa and in 1993, Eritrea separated from Ethiopia following a protracted war – a peace deal was only achieved in 2018. South Africa remained under firm control by its white minority, oppressing its black, Asian and mixed-raced populations under a system called '''apartheid''' until 1994. Morocco maintains control over Western Sahara despite an established independence movement, and this remains a point of contention between Morocco and Algeria. The conflict flared up again in 2020. Following years of civil war, South Sudan became independent from Sudan after a referendum was held in 2011.\n\nEuropeans divided Africa with complete disregard for the cultures and ethnic groups in the continent, often dividing a people between two or more countries and forcing peoples with a history of fighting or differing religions into one country. Additionally, a lack of training in civil service before and even after independence left most countries with dysfunctional governments. Leaders tended to reward their own ethnic groups with jobs and money, and in many cases oppressed other ethnic groups. This has been a cause of much strife post-independence across much of sub-Saharan Africa and has led to dozens of prolonged '''civil wars''' (notably in Sudan, Angola, Ethiopia/Eritrea, Nigeria, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo), genocides (notably the Rwandan Genocide), countless coups, and countless inept, corrupt leaders. During the cold war some leaders played the big power blocs against each other while others stayed in power mostly because they were backed by either side. Especially after the cold war ended, some countries such as Somalia descended into protracted internal fighting and are considered failed states as nobody really has any power over the state as a whole and local rackets and militias are unable to provide more than the most basic government functions (with the exception, in that case, of the former British colony of Somaliland). The discovery of valuable natural resources such as oil, uranium, diamonds, and coltan (columbite–tantalite, an ore from which the rare earth metals niobium and tantalum, in very high demand for technological products such as cell phones, are extracted) is one of the reasons separatist movements have sprung up, motivated in part by the greed of warlords and in part by the neglect of resource-rich areas that want a share in the profits, like the oil-rich exclave of Cabinda, Angola and the South South Nigeria|Niger Delta in Nigeria.\n\nFortunately, there are numerous examples in Africa where past conflict has made way for functional and stable governments, offering some hope for the future of Africa. The bleak picture often painted of Africa as a whole could not be further from the truth in many places and thanks to tourism, more stable and accountable governance and rapidly growing economies, some African countries are now looking towards a bright future of which the first signs are already visible.\n\n===Climate===\nAs the second largest continent, there is a wide range of climates to be found. However, since the continent is nearly centred on the equator, much of the continent is quite warm/temperate with very few, small areas on the continent experiencing any temperatures that can be considered \"cold\". In the temperate regions (parts of northern Morocco and the Mediterranean coast as well as South Africa), temperatures generally range from the 10s°C to the mid-30s°C (40s–90s°F) year round. Closer to the equator and on islands like Cape Verde or Mauritius, temperatures may only vary less than 20 degrees Celsius (15–35°C/60–95°F) throughout the year. In the deserts and arid regions like the Sahel and Horn of Africa, temperatures routinely hit 40°C or higher (and even 50°C or higher in the heart of the Sahara) but because sand does not retain heat like moist soil does, those same places can easily fall down to 15°C at night. There are a few bastions of cooler weather, however. Higher elevations, such as the Atlas Mountains in Morocco and Algeria or the mountains in Lesotho, are quite cold and snowy during winter and Mount Kilimanjaro, almost on the equator, is cold enough year-round to support glaciers! Peaks on islands such as Reunion, the Canary Islands, Cameroon and other countries are cool enough to necessitate a jacket much of the year.\n\nA far more important factor to consider when travelling to Africa is when the '''rainy season''' occurs, depending on the monsoon. While rain may not be a huge factor when travelling to southern or East Africa, it is very problematic in West Africa and on islands in the Indian Ocean. In West Africa, rains will often flood and make many roads and railways impassable and, due to poor drainage, can literally result in rivers of water flowing down streets and sewage lines overflowing. In the Sahel, it can result in flash floods in low-lying areas. Actually, drowning may be the most common cause of death in the desert, as flash floods can surprise people walking in wadis (dry riverbeds). Timing of the rainy season varies a bit even in neighbouring countries, so check the country pages. In West Africa the season starts in March around Cameroon, but not until June in Senegal or the Sahel, and ends around September.\n\nThe largest weather-related dangers for travellers to Africa other than flooding are '''lightning''' and '''tropical cyclones'''. The Democratic Republic of the Congo has more lightning strikes each year than any other country on earth, especially in the eastern part of the country near Goma. Lightning risk is highest from western Kenya/Tanzania and Ethiopia west to Senegal and south to Angola, Zambia and the Northern parts of South Africa. Tropical cyclones affect the islands of the Indian Ocean, with the season running from mid-November to end of April (mid-May in the Seychelles and Mauritius). Tropical cyclones also infrequently affect the horn of Africa near Djibouti and Somalia, but when they do, the arid land results in major flooding. Tropical cyclones often form off the coast of western West Africa (Guinea/Senegal) during the early part of the Atlantic Hurricane Season (June–August) and will rarely impact Cape Verde, for which these particular storms are called \"Cape Verde-type hurricanes\".\n\n===Politics===\nAfter Africa's messy divorce from its European colonial powers, many African countries became mired in political power struggles and civil war. Since the 1980s, however, the nations of this continent have drawn closer and many conflicts on the continent have seen neighbouring countries intervene positively rather than intervention/invasion by European and Western powers. Most African countries are developing democracies—struggling with corruption, but moving towards democratic values, like free and fair elections, freedom of speech, and involvement in government by several strata of society.\n\nNevertheless, there are a few countries which still retain authoritarian governments, dictatorships, and kleptocracies. Prior to peace agreements ending civil war in each, Angola and Mozambique were Communist one-party states and remain under the control of these parties, which have shifted from Marxist-Leninist to far-left/socialist ideology and retain Communist symbols in their flags, coats of arms, national anthems, and other national symbols. Equatorial Guinea and Eritrea remain among the most authoritarian countries on Earth, with severe repression of opposition.\n\nSeveral national governments have a weak hold of their territory, such as Somalia, both Congos, the Central African Republic, Chad, Libya and Mali. In addition to national governments, some \"tribes\" continue to retain kings/chiefs recognised by the national government as well as local people and are sometimes even given limited autonomy/authority over \"tribal\" lands. The problem of \"tribalism\" that plagues many African countries is somewhat of a misnomer, as many of these \"tribes\" are ethnically and linguistically more diverse and different from each other than most European ethnicities, and often they were forced to live in one state due to the arbitrary nature of colonial borders. Still in some African countries ethnic and personal loyalties were more important than party ties or ideologies and the marginalised ethnicities often strived to overturn these regimes, only to replace them with one dominated by their ethnicity. &lt;!--this is remarkably similar to the Sunni-Shia divide in Muslim countries or the troubles in Northern Ireland--&gt;\n\nToday, more than at any time in the continent's history, the nations of the continent are cooperating on important issues and increasingly relying on each other to stop conflict and broker peace, rather than allowing the UN and Western powers to do so. The [http://www.au.int/en/ '''African Union'''] ('''AU''') is the continent's answer to the United Nations and promotes unity and the resolution of conflicts. It was established in 2002, with its administrative seat in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and represents all African nations and territory, and various European possessions in the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. The AU has been able to achieve some accomplishments in promoting human rights, development, economic integration, harmonising business/customs/immigration rules, and intervening to stop conflicts (notably in Somalia) and unconstitutional power plays in member states. However, much work remains to be done and corruption remains rampant, numerous countries suffer from political/ethnic strife, and quality measures in development, education, health, and human rights remain low.\n\n====European influence and development aid====\nEuropean colonial powers remained active in many nations post-independence; France retains close diplomatic, military and economic ties with many of its former colonies, and many of the others, such as the United Kingdom, Portugal and Belgium, have large African immigrant communities originating from their respective former colonies. The U.S., largely unburdened by the \"former colonial power\" stigma, has long been active in promoting conflict resolution, human rights, and providing development aid and emergency assistance. While development aid rarely exceeds 1% of the donor countries' budgets, some African countries are or have in the past been dependent on aid money and credits from countries and international institutions such as the World Bank. While there has been a change in focus from large-scale projects such as dams and highways to more local initiatives such as rural electrification or public transport for individual cities, the topic remains controversial and some African voices have even called for an end to development aid altogether. Another problem with the World Bank credits is that new (democratic) governments often have to pay back old credits that their (authoritarian, kleptocratic) predecessor have taken out and wasted or outright embezzled, thus forcing their political agenda to conform to the wishes of the World Bank in large part instead of their own people. The question whether some or all of those \"onerous loans\" should or could be forgiven is another contentious issue between the (mostly European and North American) creditor nations and the African debtors. Another source of money for many people as well as countries is so-called \"remittances\" – that is, money that emigrants from African countries send back to their friends and relatives in their former home countries. While this has sometimes helped grow local economies and bring direly needed investment, the extreme dependence of some areas on this source of revenue has created a great deal of economic problems. As a traveller you will probably notice that Western Union and similar services are available almost ubiquitously, as they are frequently used for the purpose of receiving remittances.\n\n====Chinese influence====\nChina has notably been a major player on the continent since 2000 and Western diplomats are now trying to play catch-up and fight for influence with China. The Chinese demand for natural resources is great and the Chinese have accosted many African governments without the stigma of being a rich, Western nation or caring much about the values (human rights, political freedom, etc.) of the governments they deal with. Another selling point for them is the large number of state-run companies they have and the integration between the Chinese government and the state-owned companies they use to mine and build roads and infrastructure compared to the relationship between Western governments and private businesses. China has largely sought mineral rights by building infrastructure and seeking lucrative concessions for their state-owned companies as up-front \"payment\" for resources to be later extracted. The largest gift from the Chinese is likely the US$200 million headquarters complex for the African Union, built and financed by China and opened in 2012. There is also an increasing number of African students choosing to study at Chinese universities, and several scholarships offered by the Chinese government for that purpose. Whether the Chinese involvement proves beneficial or is just another form of neocolonialism remains to be seen, and is a controversial topic both inside the countries China is involved in and outside of them.\n\n====Russian influence====\nRussian influence has also been growing in Africa since the 2020s, with the post-coup governments in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger having expelled the French military and brought the Russian military in to replace them.\n\n===Religion===\n, Namibia, built in colonial style]]\n\nReligion and spirituality are important all across Africa. The most prolific religions are Christianity and Islam, with a sizeable number of irreligious/atheist Africans and adherents of traditional religions. The exact percentages of religious adherents vary widely across regions and among respected sources, with roughly 40–50% Muslim, 40–45% Christian, 10–15% indigenous beliefs and 5–10% irreligious.\n\nChristianity is spread across a large region, encompassing nearly all of Southern, Central and Eastern Africa, and has a long history on the continent. Egypt is closely associated with early Christian Church history. Ethiopia was among the first nations to adopt Christianity as their official religion (in 330&amp;nbsp;C.E.) Most Christians are Protestant or Roman Catholic and mix it with indigenous beliefs, except for the Orthodox populations of Egypt, Ethiopia and Eritrea. Christian missionaries and the desire to \"civilise\" tribal Africans through conversion was a major drive of European colonisation.\n\n\n\nIslam is the largest religion on the continent by number of adherents (according to most sources) but, bolstered by the large Muslim populations of Egypt and Nigeria, covers a smaller geographic footprint. All North African countries are overwhelmingly Muslim with only Egypt having a sizeable Christian minority, but irreligion is growing, especially among urban youth. Nearly all of West and Sahelian Africa is also majority Muslim, except for Cape Verde, Liberia, Ghana, Benin and Togo. Nigeria, Chad and Cote d'Ivoire are all about equally split between Muslim populations in the north and Christians in the south. Islam was first brought to the continent in the centuries after its birth, spreading across northern Africa and later being spread down the Indian Ocean coast by merchants and seafarers to the coasts of Kenya, Tanzania and the Comoros. The Swahili language is strongly influenced by Arabic. Most Muslims are Sunni, with a large population of moderate Sufis in West Africa and Sudan, who often blend Sunni Islam with traditional beliefs. An attempt has been made to promote more conservative forms of Islam since the 1990s, through Muslim NGOs and Saudi Arabian assistance, although this coincides with a fear of radicalisation and the emergence of al Qaeda and other Islamist groups in parts of North Africa and the Sahel (particularly Mali, Niger and Algeria). In certain Muslim regions, adherence to religious law is expected, such as no alcohol consumption (but khat is fine, ''where legal'') and the covering of women's limbs, and extreme offence is taken when these rules are broken or, worse, Islam or its prophets are insulted.\n\nTraditional African religions are practised by many Africans either exclusively or as syncretic elements woven into their practice of Christianity or Islam. There is no single uniting aspect to these religions beyond the fact that they all rely on oral tradition and animism. In some cases, the belief isn't in particular deities, but rather \"magic\". Among common, but certainly not universal, elements of indigenous African religions are:\n\n* Recognition of one god or dual gods and respect for natural elements as supernatural beings\n* Respect of the cyclical nature of life (agriculture, rain/drought, wax/wane of the moon)—the \"circle of life\";\n* Communication with ancestors is practised or integral to communication with god and other deities;\n* Medicine men and traditional healers are consulted for a broad range of topics, such as physical, psychological, spiritual, moral, and legal matters. They may also facilitate communication with ancestral spirits or use magic and sorcery — hence the term \"witch doctors\".\n\n]]\n\nMagic plays a role in many traditional African beliefs. Magic refers to the interaction between the natural &amp; supernatural worlds, the seen &amp; the unseen. Magicians, witches, shamans and sorcerers are believed to have special skills to manipulate communication and relations between the two worlds, either for better or for worse. Unfortunately, it is a somewhat common occurrence (especially in rural Central and West Africa) for people to claim that others are using magic for improper reasons and are witches. Accusations of being a witch or using magic often lead to ostracism of individuals — women are thrown out of homes, children are abandoned by parents, are subjected to violent and painful exorcisms, and are frequently murdered. In some places, witches are believed to be the source of terminal illnesses such as cancer and AIDS.\n\nThe Vodun religion practised in Togo and Benin (a precursor to Haitian Voudou and related religions among the African Diaspora in the Americas) believes that all creation is divine and thus carries the power of the divine. This explains how certain plants have the ability to heal and why mundane \"fetishes\", such as statues or dried plants and animals, hold healing and rejuvenating powers.\n\nHinduism is practised by the large ethnic Indian populations in former British colonies of Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, South Africa, the Seychelles and Mauritius, where many Indians were indentured servants under British masters. Mauritius is the only African country, and for that matter, the only country outside South Asia, where a majority of the population practices Hinduism (52%). Judaism has a long, if not well known, history on the continent. The largest Jewish community in Africa today is in South Africa, mostly comprised of Ashkenazi Jews of Lithuanian descent. The Beta Israel of Ethiopia are legally-recognised Jews and believed to be descendants of one of the Ten Lost Tribes (the Tribe of Dan). Many Jewish communities existed throughout North Africa, some from the early Diaspora while others fled persecution in Iberia in the 7th and 15th centuries. Those communities are now almost entirely gone, having emigrated to North America, Israel and France to escape persecution or being outright forced out after the founding of the state of Israel, though vestiges of these communities do still survive in Morocco and Tunisia.\n\n===Read===\n* Achebe, Chinua. ''Things Fall Apart''. The classic work of modern African literature. Though set in pre-colonial Nigeria, Achebe's magnum opus is in some sense the story of European colonisation of Africa as a whole. It was groundbreaking when published for telling an African story from the perspective of Africans, rather than Europeans. At the time, it was standard to portray African cultures as primitive and simple; Achebe broke this assumption by depicting the richness and complexity of an African society.\n* Battuta, Ibn. ''The Travels of Ibn Battuta.'' The travel diaries of the legendary explorer Ibn Battuta, considered one of the greatest travellers in history. In 1325, he set out on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca from his native Morocco, age 21, and over the next three decades passed through more than 40 modern countries travelling over three times the distance than near-contemporary Marco Polo. His 1325-1332 trip visited North Africa, Somalia, and the Swahili Coast (Kenya, Zanzibar and Tanzania). A journey between 1349-1354 visited Timbuktu, passing through modern Morocco, Mauritania, Mali, Niger and Algeria. A few modern translations exist, including the 1829 translation by Samuel Lee (''The Travels of Ibn Battuta.'' Cosimo Classics, 2009. ) and a 2003 one by Tim Mackintosh-Smith (''The Travels of Ibn Battuta.'' Macmillan UK, 2003. ), who also re-traced Battuta's footsteps in the early 21st century and published a few other books about his journeys. Battuta's pilgrimage to Mecca, travelling across medieval North Africa &amp; the Middle East was the basis for the 2009 IMAX film ([http://www.journeytomeccagiantscreen.com/ ''Journey to Mecca: In the Footsteps of Ibn Battuta''], [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1235836/ IMDb]).

When flying to major destinations like Johannesburg, Nairobi, or Accra, there's a good amount of choice and airfare costs about average when compared to routes of similar length around the world. Airfares tend to be cheaper when booked from a European capital that has a strong colonial link to your destination, which typically means from London, Paris, Brussels and Lisbon. Egypt also has plentiful, cheap connections with the Middle East &amp; Europe. However, less popular destinations like Brazzaville or Niamey may only be served by a few flights per week operated by major airlines and the cost of airfares can be expensive. Some African airlines (such as South African airlines) only service their neighbouring African countries.\n\nAfrica's major airlines—Royal Air Maroc, Kenya Airways, Egypt Air, &amp; Ethiopian Airlines—all offer a decent level of service to the continent's capitals and other major cities and fly to many major cities around the world. Few other African airlines operate inter-continental flights and many have poor or questionable safety records and offer poor levels of service. Many flights to Africa are available from/through Europe and the Middle East. Keep in mind that many airlines are part of alliances and code share agreements and you will likely fly on more than one airline.\n\nSee your destination's article for more specific information on flights. Bear in mind that many African countries only offer a few international flights each day, or in some cases, each week. While it isn't hard to reach South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria or Egypt, getting to Malawi or Togo can be quite a challenge.\n\n====From Europe====\nThere are more flights to Africa from Europe than from any other continent. Popular holiday destinations such as Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Cape Verde, Kenya &amp; South Africa are well-served from Europe's major cities, even with discount and charter airlines. Royal Air Maroc, Tunisair, Egypt Air have a good selection of European destinations and Ethiopian, Kenya Airways, Rwanda Air, Air Senegal, TAAG Angola airlines serve one of more major cities (London, Paris, Lisbon etc.). Turkish Airlines flies to 44 destinations in 41 African countries as of 2023 and has some of the lowest fares. The cheapest flights to African cities are often through the African country's former colonial power. Cities with large immigrant populations such as London, Marseille, and Paris have a good number of flights to Africa. \n\n====From Asia and the Middle East====\nNearly all North African countries along with Sudan, Eritrea, Djibouti and Somalia have extensive connections with the Middle East. And similarly, countries with large Muslim populations are likely to have a connection to Jedda or Mecca either year-round or seasonal (e.g. during hajj). Middle Eastern airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways have greatly expanded their services to Africa, and offer connections to many major African cities at competitive rates than European airlines.\n\n====From the Americas====\nMultiple destinations are served non-stop or directly from the United States, including Johannesburg, Nairobi, Lagos, Addis Ababa, Accra and Dakar. Limited service is available from Brazil (to Angola and the Canary Islands), Canada (to Algeria), Cuba (to Angola), and Venezuela (to the Canary Islands). Kenya airways, Delta, United and Ethiopian Airlines are the main operators between the US and Africa. Delta's Johannesburg to Atlanta flight is the second-longest flight in the world by both distance (13,582&amp;nbsp;km) and scheduled time (16&amp;nbsp;hr 40&amp;nbsp;min).\n\n====From Australia====\nThere are only a handful of direct flights connecting Johannesburg to  Perth and Sydney. Additionally there is a connection between Mauritius and Perth.\n\n===By road or ferry===\nThe only land connection to another continent is the 163&amp;nbsp;km-wide Isthmus of Suez, which is found in Egypt (although the Sinai peninsula is sometimes considered a part of Africa for geopolitical reasons). Thus the only way to drive into Africa is to drive through Egypt. Most people driving from the Middle East to Africa travel through Jordan and take a short car ferry to Egypt to avoid transiting Israel, since Egypt's two African neighbours (Sudan and Libya) visa trouble|deny entry for persons with Israeli stamps or Egyptian/Jordanian stamps indicating travel to Israel.\n\nDespite there being just one, narrow land crossing into the continent, there are other ways to bring vehicles into Africa by short car ferries. The short crossing of the Strait of Gibraltar between Spain and Morocco is crossed by several ferries daily and relatively inexpensive. Other car ferries include:\n* Italy–Tunisia ferries are operated by a [http://www.directferries.co.uk/tunisia.htm couple of different companies]. However, you must pass through Algeria to Mauritania/Niger -or- Libya to Egypt, both very expensive and difficult to enter with a car.\n* Spain or France to Algeria car ferries are run by Algerie Ferries. Their website is [http://www.algerieferries.dz/ in French only].\n* Yemen–Djibouti ferries may be running weekly or more frequently (information about this crossing is little and conflicting) to avoid Egypt (because of the extremely high import taxes) or Sudan (as the Ethiopian-Sudan border is prone to banditry). It is also possible to cross by dhow in motorcycles or small/light vehicles.\n* Port Sudan, Sudan to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia car ferries are run daily and are a great way to avoid the ''very'' high tariffs to enter Egypt, although visas for SA are difficult to obtain.\n* Ferries link Morocco with Spain and Gibraltar. In addition, there are also connections between mainland Spain and its African possessions Ceuta and Melilla, from which you can drive across the border to Morocco.\n\nSeveral overland trucks make journeys which cross between Europe or the Middle East and Africa, these companies are listed below under \"#By overland truck|Get around/By overland truck\".\n\n===By boat===\n in the Seychelles, can only be reached by boat or plane.]]\n\nMany Mediterranean cruises stop in North African countries such as Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, the Canary Islands and Cape Verde. Some ocean liners will stop in the Canary or Cape Verde Islands on trans-Atlantic crossings or in South Africa, Madagascar, Mombasa, Zanzibar, the Seychelles, or Mauritius on round-the-world trips.\n\nElsewhere in Africa, cruises are limited to luxury or 'boutique' cruise lines often aboard small vessels and quite expensive or \"Freighter travel|freighter cruises\" which do not offer much to \"passengers\" but may spend a few days in a handful of ports. [http://www.grimaldi-freightercruises.com Grimaldi Freighter Cruises] has weekly departures to West Africa making the round-trip from Amsterdam in 38 days.\n\nThe Seychelles, Reunion and Mauritius are popular destinations for yachts and private vessels, but piracy around the Horn of Africa has kept a lot of the European vessels away.\n\n==Get around==\nAfrica's infrastructure was largely built to extract natural resources to the respective colonial metropoles. As such, intra-Africa connections tend to be poor, though that is slowly changing through 21st century Chinese infrastructure projects.\n\n===Visas===\nThe general rule that visas are more difficult to obtain for countries that have more authoritarian governments and are less \"classical\" tourist destinations is true for Africa as well, although there are exceptions. Also with few exceptions it is easier to get into most countries if you are from a \"first world\" country. Visa requirements and costs for African countries differ depending on your nationality/citizenship and by country. Many countries in southern and eastern Africa have visa-free or visas available at the airport or border crossing for EU, American, Canadian, and a few other nationalities with a minimal amount of paperwork and wait. On the other hand, some countries have burdensome requirements that often differ among their embassies and border crossings.\n\nMost countries in West Africa require visas for travellers from outside the region. In some cases these visas can be arranged at airports or (less commonly) at borders, but this is often not an option. West African embassies are not widespread outside of the region (generally limited to former colonial metropoles), and visa services are sometimes not available in some neighbouring countries. Sometimes visas are issued rapidly, sometimes it's a lengthy and costly process. Check before starting a trip across the region, as regulations and practices often change. \n\nMore and more African countries now have E-visas.\n\nThere are four customs unions in effect in Africa:\n* Southern Africa: South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini\n* West Africa: Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Burkina Faso, Cote D'Ivoire, Togo, Benin, Niger, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone\n* Central Africa: Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Republic of the Congo, Gabon\n* East Africa: Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi\n\n\n\n===Accessibility===\n&lt;!-- with children, for handicapped.--&gt;\n\n===By plane===\nThere are a number of reliable airlines that ply the African Continent. Chief among them are:\n\n* '''South African Airways (SAA)''' (Johannesburg, South Africa), [http://www.flysaa.com], has daily flights to most major Southern, Eastern, &amp; Central African political and economic hubs.  The flight from Washington, D.C. does stop in Senegal, but if you get off there, SAA has no connections to anywhere else.\n* '''Kenya Airways''' (Nairobi, Kenya), [http://www.kenya-airways.com], connects more African cities than any other airline on the continent. It is partly owned by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, offers good service and frequent flights to all countries within the East African region and many other major African and international destinations.\n* '''Ethiopian Airlines''' (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia), [http://www.ethiopianairlines.com] carries more passengers than any other African airline. It offers a direct service from many European cities &amp; Washington to its hub Addis Ababa. From there it has a very good coverage to many cities in Africa. The flight from/to Washington refuels in Rome. \n\nThere are also many airlines which are noteworthy in particular regions, such as TAAG Angola Airlines (South/Central Africa), Royal Air Maroc (West/Central/North Africa, but its hub is in Morocco), Air Côte d'Ivoire (West Africa), Air Burkina (West Africa), Air Senegal (West Africa), Air Austral (Indian Ocean), Air Mauritius (Indian Ocean), Tunis Air (North Africa), and Rwanda Air (East Africa). Many other African carriers offer flights to more remote locations.\n\n\n\n===By car===\n\nIf you want to drive your own car around Africa see also Carnet de Passage\n\nFor sightseeing trips, it may be less expensive to hire a taxi than to rent a car, but be sure to negotiate taxi fares beforehand. Travel on rural roads can be slow and difficult in the dry season and disrupted by floods in the rainy season. If you plan on travelling in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa, avoid the rainy months of May through October above the equator and the rainy months of November through April below the equator. Some roads may be flooded or washed out during these months.\n\nTravel by car outside large towns can be dangerous. Major roads are generally well maintained but there are few divided highways in Africa. In addition, rural auto accidents are fairly common because of high speed limits and the presence of wildlife in these areas. Night driving, especially in rural areas, is not recommended, and visitors are encouraged to hire reputable tour operators for safaris or other game viewing expeditions.\n\n===By bus===\nBus service is extensive in Africa and in almost all countries it is the main means of transportation for locals and tourists alike. Styles of busses and minibuses vary across the continent, refer to country pages for more info.\n\n===By thumb===\nLocals tips for hitchhiking|hike rides in vehicles with strangers throughout Africa, often paying a fee to the driver in return for the favour or service. The distinction between a private vehicle and a taxi is blurred and in many countries, informal taxi businesses flourish, by picking people up from the side of the road who want a lift. In some areas, such as Johannesburg, specific hand signals are used by hitchhikers to indicate where they wish to go and it is common for vehicles to carry several people at the same time to a particular area. Foreigners may expose themselves to considerable personal risk by travelling in this way, and it is important to understand the political and social climate of each region before doing so.\n\n===By overland truck===\nSome people with limited amounts of time or who would prefer not to make their own arrangements opt for the \"overlander\" experience. Many operators run tours in large trucks that are comfortable and equipped with facilities for around 8-30 persons. They're generally run on a pretty tight schedule and cover a lot of distance, such as \"Nairobi to Johannesburg in six weeks\". These tours are run throughout the whole continent but East and Southern Africa are by far the most popular destinations. Accommodation is mostly camping with tents provided. Most meals are arranged and many are prepared by those on the trip (cooking duties rotated throughout the trip), and free time (like everything else) is scheduled. However, there is plenty of time to participate in the adventure activities that certain areas of Africa are famous for such as Victoria Falls, Swakopmund, Zanzibar, and Serengeti National Park. Some people really enjoy these tours, especially when they do not have enough time to organise all travel arrangements themselves. Others loathe the very thought of travelling in a group and think that they keep you way out of touch with the \"real\" Africa. Whatever the case, they're a very different way to travel through Africa. The people that go on these tours tend to be young at heart and slightly adventurous; these tours are not luxury trips.\n\n===By train===\n\n\n\nMost railway lines in Africa were built by the colonial powers, often with great human cost, with the main purpose of extracting wealth from the interior to coastal cities for export. After the fall of colonialism, many lines haven't been extended or maintained. passenger railways in Africa are therefore sparse with the majority being short, slow and within one country. However, during the 2010s, Chinese and European investment have rehabilitated several lines and also built new standard gauge railway lines in several countries.\n\nThe North Africa|North African states of Algeria, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia all have rail networks of adequate quality, some of them even comparing favourably to a few European or East Asian countries, with connections to most major cities. In 2018, Morocco opened Africa's first true high speed rail line between Tangier and Rabat. Due to political tensions (and in part the sparse population in border areas) there are however no international train services between these countries. For travellers to and from Egypt the old Wadi Halfa to Khartoum, in Sudan, train is useful as it connects with the ferry across Lake Nasser to the Egyptian rail terminus in Aswan. A unique experience, but not very useful as a means of transportation, is to ride the longest train in the world in Mauritania, either in the caboose or atop open iron ore carriages. Libya has no railways and plans to change that were derailed by the political troubles that have shaken this country since the 2010s.\n\nSouth Africa has a long history with passenger rail, there are overnight trains from most major cities several times per week. Additionally Gauteng province is served by the fast ''Gautrain'', connecting the major cities of Johannesburg and Pretoria with O.R. Tambo International Airport. There are no proper international trains to South Africa but several lines terminate at border cities, making it quite easy to travel from neighbouring countries such as Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Most other countries in Southern Africa have some form of passenger services, but quality and frequency vary greatly. Finally, for those with money to splurge, there are trains like the [http://www.bluetrain.co.za '''Blue Train'''] and [https://www.rovos.com '''Rovos Rail'''], which offer luxurious old world charm. \n\nEast Africa has had declining services for a long time but due to recent investment several new lines have opened between major cities. Both Ethiopia and Kenya now boast brand new trains connecting major cities. The classic TAZARA line, connecting Dar es Salaam with Kapiri Mposhi in Zambia still holds up, passing through several national parks. Central Africa|Central African countries have fared worse with little to no investment, and railways to show for it. Angola has rehabilitated its railway lines but services remain spotty. Very limited and erratic services are available in other countries. \n\nA few services remain in West Africa with Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso to Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire being the most usable for tourists. Nigeria is however investing heavily in rail and several new intercity trains have sprung up. Senegal has also built a new commuter rail line, linking the capital Dakar with several nearby suburban towns.\n\n===By boat===\n\n\nWhere there is water, there are usually boat services to some extent. In the DRC, boats are the primary means of transportation due to the extensive network of rivers and lack of good roads and railways. Some noteworthy river journeys in Africa are:\n\nAlong the '''Niger River''' small, wooden ''pirogues'' varying in design from a 2-person canoe to wide, ~10 person boats with a canopy and toilet. Travelling by pirogue is slow, but the Sahelian scenery and people you meet on the boat and during stops make this a memorable African experience. Due to cataracts, pirogues on the Niger only operate in Mali &amp; Niger\n\nAlong the '''Congo River''' large, old and often overcrowded ferries connect cities along the river in the Republic of the Congo, DR Congo and Central African Republic. Small boats from villages come out and moor themselves to these ferries to sell food and merchandise and the boat is a bustling marketplace of hundreds of people much of the time. Conditions aboard these ferries are poor and bearable only by the most seasoned of travellers. Talk to the captain to see if you can use one of the handful of rooms to sleep.\n\n==Talk==\n, Namibia written in the former colonial language German]]\n\nThere is no dominant language in Africa, but if you are travelling in West or Central Africa, French phrasebook|French and English will be the most useful across these nations and regions. Arabic phrasebook|Arabic is the dominant language in North Africa, although French is also widely spoken in Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. English is also useful in many countries, and dominant in much of Southern Africa. Swahili phrasebook|Swahili is the most useful language in East Africa. In Ethiopia, most people speak Amharic phrasebook|Amharic, which is indigenous to Ethiopia. Even if you know a blanket language like French, it is always a good idea to bring phrasebooks for the native languages. In Senegal, for example, despite being part of Francophone Africa, visitors are likely to find Wolof phrasebook|Wolof very useful and sometimes necessary when dealing with locals. It also helps if you have a basic understanding of the language used by a country's former colonist (e.g. German is useful to know if you are going to Namibia, since there is a large German-speaking white population). The more you wish to interact with locals or go out of the cities, the more important it will be for you to have resources to communicate in the local African languages.\n\nAfrica's linguistic diversity is exemplified by South Africa, which has eleven official languages, some of which have the most complex inventory of sounds in any human language, with over a hundred different sounds to distinguish meaning. English in comparison has less than half that number.\n\n==See==\n\n===Flora and fauna===\n\n\nMany visitors are attracted by the African flora and fauna and several countries benefit from safaris|safari tourism to African national parks.\n\n===Natural wonders===\n\n\nAfrica is home to many famous natural wonders, from the Nile River, the world's longest river, to Victoria Falls. The continent is home to two of the world's four volcanoes with permanent lava lakes – the dramatic Virunga National Park|Mount Nyiragongo which rises hundreds of metres above Goma, Democratic Republic of the Congo|DR Congo and Erta Ale in Ethiopia's stark Danakil Depression. Both volcanoes can be climbed by the adventurous tourist to stand at the rim gazing in awe at the bubbling lava below, an especially incredible sight at night! Mount Cameroon and its glorious stretch of lava also creates a beautiful site with a variety of flora and fauna.\n\n===Landscapes===\nRoughly centred on the Equator, Africa is known for landscapes typical for warm parts of the world.\n\nNorthern Africa is dominated by the immense Sahara desert wedged between the Atlantic, the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. Apart from the coastal rim and the banks of the Nile, this is a dry and remote part of the continent. The most notable (and likely easiest accessible) mountain range here is the Atlas mountains range in Morocco. The highest peak is Jbel Toubkal, the highest mountain in Africa not located in the east of the continent.\n\nSouth of the Sahara, vegetation gradually increases the further south one travels. From southern Sahel onwards, the terrain is rather flat with savanna and steppe. This is however not the case at these latitudes in the eastern part of Africa; this is the northern end of Africa's \"backbone\" of several mountain chains stretching down all the way from Ethiopia to South Africa like an extension of the Nile. East Africa is also where you can find the largest lakes, including Lake Victoria. Named after the 19th century British queen Victoria, this is Africa’s largest and the world's second largest fresh water lake by surface area and the source of one of the two forks of the Nile. The countries bordering Lake Victoria are renowned as the best places in Africa to go on safari, as well as the only places left to see chimpanzees and gorillas in their natural habitat. Due east of the lake, a little more than halfway to the Indian Ocean, and on the northern border of Tanzania, lies Africa's highest free standing mountain, Kilimanjaro. Off the coast is the Zanzibar Archipelago.\n\n from a nearby mountain, with a camel caravan in the foreground. Lake Assal and the surrounding areas are an excellent example of moonscapes.]]\n\nBisected by the Equator, unsurprisingly the heart of Africa is dominated by rainforest. The Congo rainforest is the second largest in the world, remote and mostly uninhabited, and going here is often more of an expedition than a tourist trip. The Eastern Central part is also the best place to go on the continent if you are interested in volcanoes.\n\nFurther south, the landscape becomes more and more dry again, especially in the western half. Namibia in particular is known for its deserts and canyons. The landscape is different in the east with scenic mountains and waterfalls including the mighty Victoria Falls, yes, it too was named after the queen. On the highland plateau in this corner of Africa is Lesotho, the only country in the world that is entirely located higher than 1400 m above the sea level. The southernmost part of the continent — South Africa — is reminiscent of the northernmost rim with Mediterranean climate and subtropical vegetation.\n\nThere are also several island nations or territories located in the oceans outside mainland Africa. They are as a rule mountainous with mountain chains often consisting of volcanoes. Surrounded by sea, they as a rule have cooler temperatures than inland locations at the same latitudes.\n\n===Historical civilisations===\nWhile the continent's diverse and unique wildlife is often all that is mentioned in regards to African travel, as home to the oldest civilisations on the planet, Africa has equally impressive cultures and history. The most famous civilisation on the continent, and arguably in the world, is that of ancient Egypt. From the southern city of Abu Simbel to Luxor and all the way north to Alexandria and Cairo, including the Pyramids of Giza, the only surviving one of the original Seven Wonders of the World and the most iconic symbols of this ancient kingdom. Sites from the '''Nubian Kingdom''' that had close ties with Egypt can be found in Sudan, such as Gebel Barkal and many other pyramids in Meroe. There are also remains of the former city-state of Carthage that can be found in modern-day Tunisia.\n\nEthiopia offers many ruins from the ancient '''Axumite Kingdom''' where the Queen of Sheba ruled. The obelisks and Dungur ruins in Axum were built prior to the kingdom's conversion to Christianity. As one of the world's oldest Christian nations, it is also home to many of the world's greatest and oldest Christian religious monuments, such as the Ezana Stone and the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion, where the Ark of the Covenant is said to be stored. Other famous Christian structures built later by the kingdom's successor, the '''Abyssinian Empire''', especially during the 12th and 13th centuries, can also be found in Lalibela.\n\nIn West Africa, structures from the ancient '''Mali Empire''' can be found in Timbuktu and Djenne. Although there are Islamic influences, the architectural styles of the Malian Kingdom's mosques are still quite unique and recognizably African. The cliff dwellings in Mali's Dogon Country, built by the Dogon people, are also impressive ancient structures in Mali. Remnants of the '''Ghana Empire''' can be found in parts of Mauritania and Mali, including the archaeological sites at Koumbi Saleh, Oualata and Aoudaghost. Often overshadowed by Africa's other monuments, '''Sungbo's Eredo''' in Ijebu Ode, Nigeria, built by the Yoruba people, is actually the largest pre-colonial structure remaining on the continent. Today it towers over the city, covered in vegetation. The royal palaces of the '''Dahomey Kingdom''' still stand in their former capital of Abomey, and ruins of the '''Kingdom of Kongo''' can still be found in their former capital of M'banza-Kongo. While they were largely destroyed by the British during the Scramble for Africa, Benin City and Kumasi still contain a few relics of the '''Kingdom of Benin''' and '''Ashanti Empire''' respectively. In Sokoto, Nigeria, remnants of the '''Sokoto Caliphate''' can still be found in the local museums, as well as the sultan's palace, and the city continues to serve as one of Africa's main centres of Islamic scholarship.\n\nRuins from the ancient '''Swahili culture''' can be found in the coastal areas of East Africa, particularly in Kenya and Tanzania. The Swahili structures combines elements of African architecture with Islamic architecture, which was quite prominent around the 14th century. Some of the most famous Swahili structures include the '''Gedi Ruins''' and '''Pillar Tombs''' around Malindi, and Kilwa Kisiwani. Mombasa and Zanzibar's Stone Town feature Swahili structures spanning hundreds of years from its early days to the 18th century.\n\nIn Southern Africa, the ruins of Great Zimbabwe have fascinated visitors ever since Europeans discovered them. No European had believed that the inhabitants of black Africa were capable of creating any great monuments on their own until the ruins of this ancient culture were discovered.\n\nMany cities, such as Leptis Magna, Timgad, and Dougga feature Roman ruins as impressive as those in Europe itself. Many other European structures can be found throughout the continent, dating back to the earliest days of imperialism. One of the most unique European-influenced styles is the '''Cape Dutch''' style found in South Africa, which traces its origins to the first white settlers in sub-Saharan Africa in the 17th century. Although clearly influenced by Netherlands|Dutch architectural conventions, it has also diverged significantly from European architecture to adapt to African conditions, making it a unique style in its own right. Uniquely among white communities in Africa, the descendants of these Dutch settlers, now known as the Afrikaners, have developed their own ethnic identity, and by and large consider themselves to be Africans rather than Europeans.\n\n===Music===\nMusic has been called \"Africa's common language\", and is part of everyday life in most African nations. Music in Africa is divided into six musical regions each of which have their own unique styles. The musical regions are Southern, Northern, Eastern, and Central Africa, and lastly Sene-Gambia. Southern African styles include Chimurenga (mostly dominant in Zimbabwe) and Mbaqanga which has come to be widely known as South African jazz (mostly dominant in Botswana and South Africa), Sene-Gambia African styles include, Griot (played across Mali, Guinea, Gambia and Senegal). Central African styles include Soukous which takes pieces of Latin rumba, American jazz, a bit of rock and incorporates it into a style very unique to the Congo (very dominant in the Republic of the Congo|Congo regions). East African styles include the very energetic Benga which is dominant in East African countries like Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.\n\nWest African styles include Juju and Highlife, Juju is a style of Nigerian popular music derived from traditional Yoruba Percussion while Highlife originates from Ghana but is also played in Nigeria. Northern African styles include Magrib and Rai both of which bear strong Islamic and Arabic stamps thanks to the Medieval Islamic expansions. This kind of music is very popular in Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco. Western popular music and many musical genres from the Americas (including ragtime, country music, jazz, the blues, rock'n'roll, reggae, calypso, salsa and samba) exhibit strong influences from traditional African music, while these genres in turn have exerted a strong influence on modern African pop music. South Africa is also known for its jazz musicians who participated in their own unique genre, among the most famous of Hugh Masekela whom was as trumpet player.                                                                                                           \n\nMost African countries have their own unique indigenous music styles of which a few are popular in other African countries. Botswana has styles which are a must-see for any traveller going there; it is also one of the few countries whose styles are popular in other African countries. Their unique styles include Setapa, Dikoma, Hosana, Chiperu and Tsutsube. All these styles have their own designated dance styles, which go along with the music as it is performed hence why they are popular in other Southern African countries and among tourists.\n\n==Do==\n===Safaris===\n\n\n, Tanzania]]\n\nSafari – an overland travel to view the stunning African flora and fauna|African wildlife – is arguably the greatest tourist attraction in Africa. Most countries, except in the north, have at least one African national parks|national park with organised safaris. A safari can take on a range of forms, from a simple one-day minibus ride, to week-long stays at a lodge. Commonly it is a 4x4 ride across the savanna in search of the \"Big five\": elephants, lions, leopards, rhinos, &amp; buffalo. Such safaris are offered primarily in Southern Africa|Southern and East Africa. Many parks have strict regulations both on visitor activities and behaviour, along with entry &amp; camping fees. Among the most well-known parks are South Africa's Kruger National Park, Tanzania's Ngorongoro Conservation Area|Ngorongoro Crater, Etosha National Park in Namibia, the Okavango Delta region of Botswana, and the Tsavo Tsavo East National Park|East/Tsavo West National Park|West National Parks, and Nairobi National Park.\n\n, Namibia.]]\n\nThe three basic safari styles are driving safari, walking safaris, and mobile safari. Some regions also offer safaris on boats/canoes, horses, elephants, or hot air balloon or light aircraft. The '''driving safari''' is by far the most popular form of safari and is best for most first-timers as it is easier, often cheaper, and generally allows you to see more wildlife. A driving safari can be a one-day affair, but it often includes a couple nights spent camping or in lodges. Low-price driving safaris are often made in minibuses without a guaranteed window seat. Luxury safaris will likely include drives in a 4x4 vehicle in small groups and stays at fine lodges with swimming pools and spas. A '''walking safari''' consists of hiking, either for a few hours or several days, with fewer opportunities to see many animals, but allows hikers to get closer to some animals and have experiences like stumbling upon the bones of a recent lion kill. For '''mobile safaris''', a camp is set up each night of your safari; it might also contain a portable lunch camp. At a ''fly-in safari'', the visitor is flown directly (or very close) to a lodge, instead of hours of overland transit.\n\n\n\nFor the most basic trips, travellers should have a minimum budget of US$70/day, while some of the most visited parks may cost US$100–150/day. Luxury trips can easily run over US$1000/day. If a price offer seems too good to be true, it often is, and there is probably a good reason why. This can be the result of hidden fees, large errors, omissions or lies when calculating a price, an unlicensed operator, abusive labour practices, poor equipment, length of the trip, and extras that you may not have thought of and for which this operator plans to charge a steep fee. Thoroughly check what each tour operator provides in their cost, and make sure to get a written agreement before payment and departure. Self-drive safaris are possible in some parks, but highly discouraged for beginners.\n\n\n\n===Climbing===\nAfrica does not have tall, jagged mountain ranges and there are very few mountains that require technical gear. The Atlas Mountains across Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia; the Drakensberg in South Africa and Lesotho; the Semian Mountains in Ethiopia; and the Rwenzori Mountains between Uganda and the DR Congo are the only considerable mountain ranges on the continent, all with numerous peaks which can be easily climbed. Additionally, there are some tall volcanoes along the Great Rift Valley, on the Indian Ocean islands and in Cameroon. Some of the continent's most climbed or unique mountains are:\n\n* Jbel Toubkal (4165&amp;nbsp;m) near Marrakech, Morocco is the tallest peak in the Atlas Mountains and can be climbed without technical gear in summer.\n* Mount Cameroon (4040 m) near Douala, Cameroon, is the tallest peak (actually a volcano) in Cameroon and is famous for the 1986 Lake Nyos disaster, when the lake released a huge volume carbon dioxide gas, suffocating thousands. Fast-paced hikes to the top and back are possible in a day.\n* Mount Kilimanjaro (5895&amp;nbsp;m) in Tanzania near the Kenya border is the continent's highest peak, the world's tallest free-standing mountain, and perhaps the most climbed mountain on the continent, owing to its accessibility and the lack of need of technical gear. The range of scenery one passes from base to peak makes it a destination almost all climbers have on their wishlist.\n* Mount Kenya (5199&amp;nbsp;m) is Kenya's tallest mountain and also popular climb with many non-technical walking and climbing routes through lush scenery and is less than 200&amp;nbsp;km from Nairobi. The surrounding national park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n* Table Mountain National Park (1086&amp;nbsp;m) which dominates the city of Cape Town has hundreds or routes to the plateau, ranging from easy walks to technical rock climbs.  In November 2011, Table Mountain was named one of the new 7 Wonders of Nature.\n* Virunga National Park|Mount Nyiragongo (3470&amp;nbsp;m) in the DRC on the Rwanda border is one of just 3-4 volcanoes in the world with a lava lake in its crater. A climb takes  about 8&amp;nbsp;hours and involves camping on a ledge at the top – a safe 700&amp;nbsp;m above the lake – for the night (of course, the steaming, bubbling lava is more spectacular at night).\n\nAbseiling and rock climbing can be done in many parts of Africa, with many opportunities in South Africa.\n\n===Trekking and hiking===\nMost of Africa's mountain ranges and highlands are suitable for trekking. The '''Drakensberg''' in South Africa and Lesotho, the '''Garden Route''' in South Africa, the '''Ethiopian Highlands''' and Mali's Dogon Country are the most popular trekking destinations in Africa and most guidebooks to these countries describe the most popular routes. In the dense jungles of the Central African Republic and DRC, treks to pygmy settlements, almost always organised, are available. Established trekking routes exist in the forests of Guinea's Fouta Djallon highlands and in Cameroon.\n\nThe Aïr Massif in Niger is popular for hiking around its sand scraped rock formations and oases, usually short distances from your camel or vehicle transport. Hiking can also be done in many forests with established paths. In Uganda, Rwanda, &amp; the adjacent DR Congo, hiking to see the endangered mountain gorilla is a major tourism draw, although permits are US$500 to spend hours hiking through tropical forests to spend 1&amp;nbsp;hour in close proximity to the gorillas.\n\n===Sport fishing===\n\n===Diving===\nThere are a good number of great scuba diving sites across Africa. The '''Red Sea''' off Egypt offers clear, tranquil waters. Diving in the '''Indian Ocean''' is common off all islands and on the continent from Kenya south. Diving in South Africa is most famous for \"shark dives\", where divers are lowered in cages to watch sharks feed on bait, although other diving opportunities exist. Few locations inland are popular with divers; '''Lake Malawi''' – which is clear, deep and filled with unique species – is the only lake with a significant number of dive operators.\n\n===Relax on a beach===\n.]]\n\nAfrica has a very long coastal line with thousands of beautiful beaches as it is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west.\n\n===Sports===\nSoccer is the most widespread and popular sport with games between countries usually drawing tens of thousands of patriotic, cheering fans filling basic stadiums, as many world class African players return from Europe to play for their respective national teams. Watching a football match in Africa is a must; try to dress in the colours of the home team and join the cheering celebration with your neighbours! The biennial '''Africa Cup of Nations''' is the continent's premier championship. The most recent AFCON was held in Côte d'Ivoire in 2024 from 13 January to 11 February. Upcoming Cups will be hosted by Morocco (2025) and Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda (2027). South Africa played host to the first African Wikivoyage:Past events/World Cup 2010|FIFA World Cup in 2010.\n\nRugby football|Rugby is played by several former British colonies in Southern &amp; Eastern Africa. South Africa's ''Springboks'' are among the best teams in the world. And while they were traditionally associated with the white and specifically the ''Afrikaner'' part of the population they have now significant following among all ethnic groups after Nelson Mandela famously wore a Springbok jersey during the 1995 world cup that was held in and won by South Africa.\n\nCricket is also played, especially in former British colonies, with South Africa being considered one of the elite teams in world cricket, and Zimbabwe also considered a respectable team.\n\n==Buy==\n===Money===\n\n\nThe three easiest currencies to exchange within Africa are the euro, US dollar, &amp; UK pound sterling. In some countries with a large tourism sector Australian &amp; Canadian dollars and Japanese yen ''may'' be exchanged at large banks and some currency exchanges, but you will receive a poor exchange rate as these currencies are uncommon and more troublesome for the banks in turn to exchange. The continent is roughly split between regions where the US dollar is easiest to exchange and use and others where the euro is. In Southern African countries the South African rand enjoys a regionally dominant position (see below) and may be easier to exchange than other currencies. Generally speaking you will experience poor exchange rates outside of most of these countries, and even currency movement restrictions.\n\nDue to concerns about counterfeiting, money changers, banks, and most likely even merchants will not accept US dollar banknotes that are worn or more than ten years old. As strange as that sounds, it seems to be a rule among anyone dealing much in dollars and you will find it difficult or even impossible to dispose of worn or older dollar banknotes. The same does not seem to hold true for euro banknotes, but may do so for other non-African currencies.&lt;!--a new series of € banknotes has been introduced since this was probably written. Will old series banknotes run into trouble?--&gt;\n\nWith few exceptions (most notably the South African rand), African currencies are generally not accepted by banks or money changers outside their native territory, or at least not at a decent exchange rate. The currencies of some smaller countries are non-exchangeable and become worthless abroad, with some countries prohibiting export of their currencies and confiscating and even fining people leaving the country with currency (most notably the Angolan kwanza).\n\nThere are three currency unions in Africa:\n\n* Common Currency Area (using South African rand): South Africa, Eswatini (Swaziland), Lesotho and Namibia.\n* West African CFA franc (XOF): Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo.\n* Central African CFA franc (XAF): Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon\n\nSome countries that are part of a currency union still mint their own currency as well (such as Namibia's dollar), meaning that both forms of currency are legal tender.\n\nDespite sharing the same name and same exchange rate (655.957 CFA francs = €1), the two \"CFA franc\" currencies are issued by different banks and are '''not''' interchangeable. A 1000 CFA franc banknote from Gabon will not be accepted by a merchant in Benin, and vice versa. Indeed, even with banks and money changers it will likely be easier (and you'll receive a better exchange rate) to exchange euro banknotes or even US dollars. Given the fixed exchange, if visiting any of these countries, the euro will receive a more favourable exchange rate.\n\nThe Mauritanian ouguiya &amp; Malagasy ariary are the only two non-decimal currencies in use in the world, divided into 1/5th fractions known as khoums &amp; iraimbilanja, respectively.\n\n====US dollar====\nThe U.S. dollar has been the ''de facto'' currency of Zimbabwe since the collapse of the Zimbabwean dollar and allowance of foreign currency as tender in January 2009. Dollar coins are usually not accepted in Zimbabwe and you may have problems getting change for small purchases. The Djiboutian franc (178.8=US$1) and Eritrean nakfa (16.5=$1) are pegged to the dollar.\n\nThe U.S. dollar is the easiest currency to exchange (and may receive a better exchange rate compared to the euro) in Southern Africa and East Africa, as well as the DR Congo, Nigeria, &amp; Liberia. Many tour operators, tourist attractions, and hotels in these regions set their prices in dollars, some even going as far as to offer poor exchange rates for or even refuse local currency. Also, many countries in these regions set their visa prices in dollars and will only accept dollars (or perhaps pound sterling).\n\n====Euro====\nThe euro is the official currency of France's Mayotte and Reunion territories, Spain's Canary Islands and Portugal's Madeira and Porto Santo. The West and Central African CFA francs are pegged to the euro at 655.975 (formerly, 100 to the French franc). The Moroccan dirham is pegged (with a fluctuation band) to the euro at roughly 10 dirhams to one euro. The Cape Verdean escudo is pegged at 110.265 to one euro and the Comoran franc is pegged at 491.9678 to one euro. The Sao Tome and Principe dobra was fixed at 24500 to one euro in 2010 to guarantee stability – it was worth just 12000 per euro in 2004.\n\nThe euro is the easiest currency to exchange and receives the best exchange rate in countries whose currencies are fixed to the euro, with strong European ties, or where the majority of tourists are European. This generally corresponds with North Africa, the Sahel, West Africa and Central Africa with the exceptions of Egypt, Sudan and Ghana, neither the euro nor dollar is better, and Nigeria, the DRC and Liberia. Due to the relatively recent creation of the euro and long-standing status of the dollar, beware that there are some regions of Africa where people either have never heard of the euro or will see it as worthless.&lt;!--is that still true some two decades after the Euro was first introduced?--&gt;\n\n====South African rand====\nThe South African rand is an official currency and widely circulated in South Africa, Lesotho, Eswatini (Swaziland), &amp; Namibia. Although the latter three issue their own currencies, they are pegged 1:1 with the rand and are not legal tender in the other countries as is the SA rand. The rand has also been accepted in Zimbabwe since the Zimbabwean dollar's demise, but not as widely as the U.S. dollar. It is also readily exchanged (and sometimes accepted for payment) in Botswana, Mozambique and most of the tourist spots in Botswana and Zambia. Namibia mints a ''local currency'' which is also legal tender alongside the SA rand in Namibia, so always note the form of currency used on goods for sale.\n\n===Banking===\n====Cashless forms of payment====\nDue to the nigh-ubiquity of cellphone ownership and the sometimes highly volatile currencies (and shortage of \"hard currency\" banknotes or their value being much too great for everyday transactions) various mobile phone based payment systems have been pioneered in Africa. Depending on your itinerary, it can be very advisable to make yourself familiar with those systems and have them installed to your phone.\n\n===Markets===\nMany African countries and tribes are known for their '''handicraft'''. High-quality sculptures, utensils and textiles can be found for a fraction of the price of a similar item made in a high-income country.\n\nNorth Africa is known for carpets.\n\n===Prohibited items===\nTrade in ivory is prohibited by nearly all countries in the world, with hefty penalties and even jail time for offenders. Many animal products (some commonly found in fetish markets) are also banned by western countries, such as tortoise shells, tusks of any animal, or any part of or item made with an endangered species. Some African countries keen on conservation will prosecute all violators to the fullest extent of the law, so be careful when purchasing animal products unless you want to spend years in an African prison. Keep in mind that even if an item may be exported from an African country it may be illegal to import into your home country; the EU and US have strict laws on importing animal products in the name of conservation. See also animal ethics.\n\nSome medications which may be purchased without a prescription in Western countries or parts of Africa may contain ingredients considered illegal narcotics or controlled substances in some countries. In particular, diphenhydramine is a \"controlled substance\" in Zambia and several Americans have been fined and jailed on drug-trafficking charges for possessing the over-the-counter allergy medicine Benadryl (elsewhere called Dimedrol) and the pain reliever Advil PM whose main active ingredient is diphenhydramine.\n\nDrug trafficking is as common an offence as in most Western countries. The list of which substances are considered prohibited or restricted drugs varies from country to country. ''Khat'' which is readily grown and consumed in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa, is an illicit drug in most other African countries. Organised drug trafficking is a major problem in Guinea and Guinea-Bissau en route from South America to Europe.\n\nAs with most countries, check local laws concerning antiquities before trying to leave the country with anything that appears to be over 100 years old.\n\nAlways make sure that any diamonds or other jewels you are buying can satisfy two conditions:\n# The number of, weight, and total value of the jewels you purchase can be legally imported back to your home country.\n# No jewels or diamonds are '''conflict jewels''', which means that they are mined or sold by terrorist or rebel groups, or are mined in non-sustainable ways.\n## '''Rough diamonds''' are subject to restrictions of the Kimberley Process, which prohibits the import and export of rough diamonds without a certificate of the country of export and your home country.\n## Your home country may also prohibit other jewel importation because of sanctions or import prohibition.\n\n==Eat==\nFood varies wildly and you can find Arab-influenced cuisine (North African cuisine|in the North) as well as European-derived (in South Africa and Namibia) or local food originating from times before colonisation. While you won't find five-star restaurants in every city or indeed every country, if you keep an open mind, you are in for some truly amazing and once-in-a-lifetime culinary experiences, once you venture out of standard tourist fare.\n\n==Drink==\nAs could be expected from a continent as huge and diverse as Africa, there are a large variety of drinking options. While South Africa has come to be known as a wine-growing region of international acclaim, drinking anything alcoholic in the Muslim-majority countries or the predominately Muslim areas of countries such as Nigeria may be unwise or even illegal. There are also a variety of non-alcoholic drinks that either originated from Africa or have been perfected here, such as rooibos tea in South Africa or coffee in Ethiopia.\n\n==Sleep==\nWhile business districts and resort cities have high-end hotels, accommodation can be very basic off the beaten path.\n\nWhile camping in a national park can be an exciting experience, be aware of dangerous animals, and of crime.\n\n==Stay safe==\nWhile much of Africa is safe for travel and many tourist attractions on the continent are far from conflict, there are still a few regions in which conflict and/or sociopolitical tensions exist. Political unrest, religious extremism and piracy are also concerns in some areas with a recent rise in militant Salafist groupings.\n\nJihadist groups are mostly concentrated in the Horn of Africa, parts of North Africa and the Sahel region, as well as their adjacent areas. '''Somalia''', where warlords have fought for control since the collapse of the central government in 1993, and the '''Central African Republic''', where general lawlessness and rebels exist throughout most of the country, should only be visited by experienced travellers who are ''very'' competent regarding the dangers that exist. Otherwise, these areas should be considered no-go regions. Exceptions are Somaliland which is ''de facto'' independent and relatively safe and the CAR's isolated Dzanga Sangha National Reserve.\n\nThe '''Democratic Republic of the Congo''' is home to the second largest jungle after the Amazon and most of the country is impassable by land. The eastern and northeastern regions are home to rebels and general lawlessness and have been home to the bloodiest conflict since World War II. Safer regions are the west (incl. Kinshasa), south (near Zambia border, incl. Lubumbashi), and a few spots practically ''on'' the border, such as Goma, Bukavu, &amp; Virunga National Park.\n\nThe '''Central Sahara''' is host to numerous problems, notably that a growing presence (or at least impact) of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in much of Saharan Algeria, northern Mali (north of Timbuktu, east of Gao, and near the Nigerien border), and far eastern Mauritania has resulted in several kidnappings (incl. one Briton beheaded, kidnapped near the Mali-Niger border) and a couple of suicide bombings in Nouakchott. Since the end of a civil war in Mali in 2012, Northern Mali (including Timbuktu, Gao and the Mauritania and Niger borders) is highly dangerous on account of the presence of Tuareg &amp; Islamist rebels. A Tuareg uprising has left much of the area around Agadez, Niger – once a popular tourist destination – off-limits and unsafe. Several borders in the Sahara are closed or very unsafe as a result of banditry: Libya-Sudan (closed), Libya-Chad (closed), Chad-Sudan (unsafe due to Darfur conflict), Chad-Niger (banditry), Libya-Niger (banditry), Mali-Algeria (no road crossings, AQIM), Algeria-Mauritania (AQIM), Mali-Niger (AQIM/rebels), Mali-Mauritania (AQIM/rebels) and Algeria-Morocco (closed).\n\nPortions of Cote d'Ivoire, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Chad are home to rebels and it is important to obtain up-to-date information on which parts of these countries are safe to visit (see warnings on those pages). Northern Nigeria is home to Islamic extremists who have carried out several attacks against non-Muslims, mostly targeting other Nigerians, but there is still a significant risk to Westerners. The region around the Niger River delta has been home to rebels for decades. Similarly, in Sudan, only the western Darfur regions and south-central \"boundary\" between the conflicting North-South are dangerous.\n\nMany countries in Africa are ''unsafe'' for '''LGBT travel|gay travellers''', with high levels of homophobia widespread in the general population. Homosexuality is illegal in most African countries (however, South Africa and Botswana are notable exceptions to this rule) and it in some cases carries the penalty of imprisonment or even death. Nigeria and Uganda have taken it a step further by making it a criminal offence to know that someone is homosexual and not report it to the police. \n\n===Crime===\nCrime in major African cities varies significantly by country and it is usually unwise to travel around at night alone. While much of it involves scamming, mugging or petty theft, violent crimes are generally less common. Check the \"stay safe\" areas of the individual countries you are going to.\n\n===Wildlife===\nIn most parts of Africa dangerous wildlife should be of only very minor, if any, concern at all. In some parts of East Africa and South Africa large abundances of potentially dangerous animals can be found, but the majority of the time any traveller would most likely be perfectly safe in a vehicle with their tour guide. Nonetheless, attacks and deaths do occur (rarely with foreigners, but commonly with locals) and it is best to be well-informed. Nile crocodiles can be extremely dangerous and swimming is not an option in most low-lying portions of East Africa. Lions and leopards can be dangerous, but you are unlikely to encounter them on foot unless you are being extremely foolish. Large herbivores such as elephants and rhinos can also be very dangerous if aggravated, even while in a vehicle, Hippopotamuses are the animal most likely to attack or kill a human unprovoked and should be avoided without an experienced guide. Venomous snakes exist and are plentiful, but are very shy and you are unlikely to even see one let alone be bitten by one. When it comes to pests, most insects in the country are no more dangerous than what you would find in any other country, and the spiders are mostly harmless to humans. Despite all of this, easily the most dangerous non-human animal in the entire African continent is the mosquito, which infects a very large number of Africans with malaria every year, and tsetse flies that cause sleeping sickness are also a major problem in some areas. (Check individual country and region pages and WHO reports to see whether the places you plan to travel to are affected by these diseases.)\n\n==Stay healthy==\n\n\nSub-Saharan Africa has the highest rates of HIV and AIDS infection on Earth. A 2005 UN Report says over 25 million Africans are infected, over 7% of adults on the continent. Be extremely cautious about any sexual activity in Africa. The rates of HIV infection among sex workers are phenomenally high.\n\nBushmeat from gorillas, monkeys, chimpanzees and mandrills should be avoided. Due to their similarity to humans, a number of diseases (including yet-undiscovered or poorly studied ones) can be spread by consuming their flesh, especially if it is not sufficiently heated. HIV is undoubtedly the most famous disease transmitted from other primates, but others include Ebola, anthrax and yellow fever.\n\nAs '''tap water''' is not always up to hygienic standards, bottled water (be careful to take a look at the seal before opening the bottle as some people simply refill bottles with tap water) is an option if you want to decrease the risk of traveller's diarrhoea, especially on shorter stays. Remember to always drink enough, especially in hot climates, and avoid drinking too much alcohol when you don't know your surroundings and/or have just recently arrived.\n\nVarious infectious diseases, including mosquito-borne diseases, are a problem in parts of Africa. Vaccines, medication, and other precautions may be recommended to avoid infection. A non-exhaustive list that travellers should think about: dengue, malaria, measles, polio, rabies, yellow fever. Measles and polio vaccines are routine in many countries, but you should make sure yours are up to date.\n\n== Respect ==\nIn virtually all African countries, elders are traditionally accorded a great deal of respect as they're seen as sources of wisdom and guidance. Be mindful of that when visiting countries in the continent.\n\n==Connect==\n\n===Telephone===\n''See also: Telephone service and List of country calling codes.''\n\nCountry calling codes for Africa are generally 3-digit numbers beginning with 2, in the form +2XX. Examples are +234 for Nigeria, +233 for Ghana, +263 for Zimbabwe, +254 for Kenya and +262 for Reunion. Exceptions are Egypt and South Africa, with the 2-digit country calling codes +20 and +27, respectively.\n\nTraditional landline telephone services are sketchy. South Africa and the North African countries are the only regions of the continent to have decent quality. It is largely owing to this that mobile phones have proliferated across the continent. Don't be surprised when you are in a seemingly remote corner of the continent and among a poor tribe, when a man whips out a mobile phone to show you pictures of family or ask you to find your Facebook profile for him to send a friend request. In many places, you will receive offers from traders to use their mobile phone for a fee, much as you would be solicited to purchase a wood carving or mat. Texting is more commonly used than calling.\n\nIf you decide to purchase a mobile phone locally, beware counterfeit phones. Smartphones are likely to be cheaply-made versions of phones a couple years behind those found in Western markets (that's not to say the latest Galaxy S model or iPhone can't be found). Should you choose to bring a phone from home, your best bet would be to bring a GSM phone (the most common network type worldwide). It's not terribly difficult to find a dealer selling scratch cards to replenish a local SIM; simply scratch to reveal a PIN number and enter into your phone (per the instructions). The cost of purchasing a SIM card and minutes is far less than charges for roaming with a mobile phone network from a Western country.\n\nContinent-wide, faster data networks (3G and 4G) are being installed at a fast pace. However, outside major cities, data service is often at very slow 2G speeds (comparable to dial-up internet or worse). Many telecom companies limit use of 4G and 3G networks to post-paid customers.\n\n===Internet access===\n, Rwanda]]\n\nComputers are out of the reach of most Africans. Therefore, computer shops (cyber cafés) are common throughout the continent, except perhaps the most isolated corners of the most inaccessible countries (Chad, CAR, Somalia). Many computers are full of viruses and malware. With a little bit of computer savviness, you can load a flash drive or burn a CD with an anti-virus program and possibly an alternative web browser (Firefox, Opera, Chrome) to use on public computers at cyber cafés.\n\nWi-Fi internet access is becoming increasingly common. Most upscale hotels along with some mid-range hotels (mainly in more developed countries) will offer it for guests. Some may charge a fee for this. Using your personal laptop, tablet, or smartphone on a Wi-Fi connection is preferable to internet cafés for accessing banking, email, social networking, and other sensitive accounts.\n\nThe fastest internet services can be found in North Africa, parts of West Africa such as Ghana, Nigeria and around East Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, Rwanda), where an impressive roll-out of fiber-optic networks and fast, new undersea cables to the Middle East has made Kenya an up-and-coming hotspot for tech companies and international businesses requiring fast connections. South Africa has the most developed and fastest internet connections on the continent. In contrast, some less-developed countries and regions continue to rely on slow satellite connections, with speeds comparable to or even worse than dial-up connections once common in Western countries. Ghana is also emerging as one of the more consistent internet service providers in Africa with the use of dongles especially being common. Wi-Fi hotspots are also available in hotels, pubs and university campuses.\n\n'''Internet censorship''' is an issue in various countries on the continent, often implemented or ramped up for political reasons. This often consists of blocked social media and other communication tools; less commonly, governments may shut off the internet altogether surrounding elections or other contentious events.\n\n===Post===\nPostal service|Postal networks are generally slow, if not unreliable altogether. Boxes and parcels sent to destinations outside the continent may take weeks or even months to arrive at their destination. FedEx, UPS and DHL maintain a good network of offices in major cities throughout the continent and the ease of shipping, speed  and better reliability are worth the higher shipping charges.\n\nPost restante is available in some countries (check with the national postal service first) and allow mail to be sent to a post office, where it is kept for the receiver. No address is written on the piece – just receiver's name, city, country, postal code, and \"Poste Restante\". Make sure the sender spells your (the receiver's) name correctly and clearly. The receiver shows up at the post office, presents identification (such as a passport) and pays a small fee. Since some post offices are rather disorganised, make sure to have the clerk check under your first name and for any possible spelling errors (describe the piece to them, ask to be shown items with a similar name, look under Q instead of O).\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Going on a Safaris|safari is a common way to see it.\n\nMost of [https://www.katonatours.com/uganda-tours/7-days-uganda-cultural-wildlife-gorilla-safari-itinerary/ Africa] is part of the '''Afrotropical realm''', together with the southern Arabian peninsula and a small part of Iran. North Africa is part of the '''Palearctic realm''', and contains Eurasian wildlife. The wildlife of Madagascar differs a lot from the mainland, and is described in a separate article.\n\n\nMany [https://www.katonatours.com/wildlife-safaris/5-days-uganda-safaris-queen-elizabeth-bwindi-primate-safari/ safari] visitors are keen on seeing the '''Big Five''' — buffalo, elephants|elephant, leopard, lion and rhino — but there is a lot more out there if you know where to look.\n\n==Mammals==\n\n===Primates===\nAfrica is home to an extremely wide variety of primates, including all the extant great apes except the orangutan. Modern humans are also believed by most scientists to trace their origins to Africa.\n\n====Baboon====\nImage:ChacmaBaboon Walking.JPG|thumb|240px|Chacma baboon\n\n''Papio ursinus'', also known as the '''common baboon''', lives in social groups guided by a dominant male. Newborn baboons are black and are carried around by their mothers. Later, they ride on the back of their mother and after three to four months they change color to the adult brown-grey.\n\n====Mandrill====\n\n\nThe mandrill is (''Mandrillus sphinx'') is known for its distinctive colourful face. Males are noticeably larger and more brightly-coloured than females. Females and their juvenile offspring usually live in large groups called hordes that can number up to several hundred, while adult males are usually solitary, only approaching hordes during the mating season. Alpha males are recognisable by their brightly-coloured posteriors.\n\n==== Bonobo ====\nThe bonobo (''Pan paniscus''), formerly known as the \"pygmy chimpanzee\", is an endangered great ape closely related to the chimpanzee, with both species being humans' closest living relatives. Like its slightly more robust cousin, its diet consists mostly of fruit, though it supplements its diet with eggs, meat, honey, and insects. It's found exclusively in the Congo Basin, separated from the range of the chimpanzee by the Congo and Kasai Rivers. Because of their jungle habitat and timid nature, bonobos are rarely seen in the wild. The main threats to the species are habitat disruption, the bushmeat trade, and ongoing wars in the region.\n\n==== [https://www.katonatours.com/chimpanzee-tours/chimpanzee-tours-and-chimpanzee-safaris-in-uganda/ Chimpanzee] ====\nThe chimpanzee (''Pan troglodytes''), while more numerous than the bonobo, is also listed as endangered. There are four recognized subspecies (with a fifth proposed), with one living in coastal West Africa and the others to the north and east of the Congo River in Central Africa. Unlike the bonobo, which prefers rainforests, it can adapt to habitats ranging from open savanna to thick rainforests. They're easier to spot than bonobo, as they're less timid and can more often be found in open environments. The main threats to chimps are similar to those faced by bonobo, and also include infectious diseases that may also affect humans.\n\n====[https://www.katonatours.com/group-tours-to-rwanda-and-uganda/1-day-group-gorilla-trekking-tour-uganda-mgahinga-national-park/ Gorilla]====\n\nGorillas are divided into two species: eastern (''Gorilla beringei'') and western (''Gorilla gorilla''). Both are endangered, and both are only found (in the wild) in poor African countries. \n\nThe most practical way of seeing gorillas in the wild is through organized tours in Rwanda or Uganda. To see western gorillas, the Republic of the Congo appears to be the best option. Outside of these organized tours/treks, not only do you have to get very lucky to see a gorilla, but you may have to deal with dangers both natural and human.\n\nGorillas can be found in zoos throughout the world.\n\n====Vervet monkey==== \nImage:Vervet_monkey_in_the_KNP.JPG|thumb|240px|Vervet monkey\n\n''Cercopithecus aethiops'' is a social monkey that lives close to rivers and feeds on leaves, fruits and insects. Family groups are up to 20 members strong.\n\nNewborn vervet monkeys are dependent on their mothers for three months, and from then on they become youngsters.\n\n===Carnivores===\nMeat-eating mammals are the kings of the bush.\n\n====Cheetah====\nImage:Cheetah 2003.JPG|thumb|240px|Cheetah\n\nCheetahs (''Acinonyx jubatus'') are the fastest hunters in Africa, but you are quite lucky if you can see them very close because they tend to be hidden in the high grass. You don't see them in the dense thickets of South Africa whereas the savanna in Kenya and Tanzania allows for better viewing. Cheetahs usually travel alone or in small groups consisting of the mother and her offspring. They hunt in the cool hours of the day. Cheetahs reach a maximum speed of up to 100 km/h in a short and explosive burst, and tackle their prey in a single attack. The preferred prey is Impala, but birds are on the menu as well.\n\n====Leopard==== \n''Panthera pardus'' are famously elusive hunters that stalk their prey at night.  For most visitors, the only chance of spotting one is on night drives, and Zambia's South Luangwa National Park (which allows night driving) is claimed by some to have the highest density of leopards in all of Africa.\n\n====Lion==== \nImage:Lion Walking.JPG|thumb|240px|Lioness walking at dusk\n\n''Panthera leo'' are common in the wider part of Africa and can be best seen in Lake Nakuru National Park, Masai Mara National Park, Serengeti and to a lesser extent in South Africa, nevertheless you have to be lucky to see them very close. Lions hunt early in the morning or in the night and during the day they allow themselves to be lazy. To see them in action you have to get up before the crack of dawn or you see them only resting after a big dinner.\n\nTheir menu consists mainly of bigger mammals and zebras seem to be the favourite if available. Males often do not contribute to the hunting but they demand the \"lion's\" share, as they are responsible for defending the pride's territory, and female youngsters have to wait until it is their turn.\n\nLion cubs are dependent on their mothers for up to two years, and they start to hunt when they are about 11 months old. Lions are social cats, living in prides of 3-30 lions consisting of 1-4 males and several females.\n\n====Spotted hyena====\nImage:Hyena_Kruger_National_Park.JPG|thumb|240px|dozy hyena\n''Crocuta crocuta'' has a bad reputation for no good reason. They are good at hunting and are not dependent on the leftovers from lions.\n\nThey live in packs of 3-4 animals and can form larger groups as well. The leader of the pack is a female and they hunt often during the night but can be spotted during the daytime as well. They prey on insects, mammals such as zebras and wildebeest and sometimes they bring down a giraffe, or fight off lions from their catch. They tend to explore bins in national parks.   \n\nCubs are dependent on their mum's milk for 9-12 months and start to look after themselves within 15 months. \n\n====African wild dog==== \nImage:South_Africa-Johannesburg-Lion_Park02.jpg|thumb|240px|African Wild Dogs\n''Lycaon pictus'' live in packs of 10-15 members.\nWild dog sightings are always a big event, so watch out for them because they are considered to be the rarest predator in Africa. Wild dogs are mainly active during the day and they hunt in the early hours or late afternoon. They prey on small mammals, Impalas, Springbok and occasionally buffaloes as well.\n\nThe packs have hierarchical structures where only the dominant female has pups and the rest help to care for them.\n\nThe pups are born in a den and they stay there for up to three weeks before they explore their environment. After five weeks the pups start to eat regurgitated meat. After 8-10 weeks they leave the den forever and follow the pack until they are about a year old. At that point, young females will leave their birth packs for new ones, while males will remain in their birth pack for life.\n\nUnlike other members of the dog family, African wild dogs either do not have the copulatory tie during mating, or have a very short one.\n\n====Black Backed Jackal====\nImage:Southern_Africa-Black_backed_jackal.jpg|thumb|240px|Black Backed Jackal\n''Canis mesomelas'' can be found throughout Southern Africa. \n\n\n====Caracal====\nImage:Africa-Caracal01.jpg|thumb|240px|Caracal at De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Sanctuary\n\nThe caracal is a medium-sized wild cat native to Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and arid areas of Pakistan and northwestern India. It is characterized by a robust build, long legs, a short face, long tufted ears, and long canine teeth. Their name means cat with black ears.\n\n===Antelopes===\nAntelopes are among the most common animals seen on safari, but there are numerous species that, to the untrained eye, can be difficult to distinguish.\n\n====Bontebok====\nImage:RSA_Bontebok.jpg|thumb|240px|A Bontebok in the [[Bontebok National Park]]\n''Damaliscus pygargus pygargus'' are mainly found in the Western Cape of South Africa. They have white, light and dark brownish markings and are easily recognised. They live in herds. However, males leave the herd at a certain age and form in small groups of their own.\n\n====Blesbuck====\nImage:Africa-Blesbuck01.jpg|thumb|240px|Blesbuck at the Lion Park in [[Johannesburg]]\n''Damaliscus pygargus phillipsi'', closely related to the Bontebok, Blesbuck are mainly found on the highveld region of South Africa.\n\n====Blue Duiker====\nImage:Southern_Africa-Blue_Duiker01.jpg|thumb|240px|Blue Duiker\n\n''Cephalophus monticola'' is a small (''under 40cm shoulder height'') antelope found in forested areas throughout Southern Africa | Southern and Central Africa\n\n\n====Blue wildebeest==== \nImage:RSA_Blue_Wildebeest.jpg|thumb|240px|Two Blue Wildebeest in high grass.\n\nBlue wildebeest (''Connochaetes taurinus'') are large antelopes that form small groups and are seasonal breeders. Offspring arrive from November to February, and are born within the herd. Calves may be defended fiercely against any attacker.\n\n====Eland====\nTwo species of antelope are known as \"eland\". They are the world's two largest species of antelope.\n\nThe '''common eland''' (''Taurotragus oryx'') can be found in open and semi-open areas throughout East and Southern Africa, though not dense forests. Males average around 1.6 m (5 ft) at the shoulder and over 500 kg (1,100 lb), though can be nearly 1,000 kg (2,200 lb). Females are roughly 25–35% smaller than males. Both sexes have fairly straight horns that spiral around the axis of growth. They are not considered endangered, and have a relatively calm disposition; some have been successfully domesticated.\n\nThe '''giant eland''' (''Taurotragus derbianus'') is the largest antelope; while it overlaps greatly in size with the common eland, it averages about 5–10% larger. Like its cousin, it lives mostly in open and semi-open areas, but can also live in dense forests. The horns in both sexes are similar in shape to those of common eland. The giant eland is harder to observe than the common eland, being more alert and wary. Two subspecies exist—the western giant eland (''T. d. derbianus''), living mainly in West Africa (particularly Senegal and Mali), and the eastern giant eland  (''T. d. gigas''), living in Central Africa between Cameroon and South Sudan. The species is considered vulnerable but not yet endangered.\n\n====Impala==== \nImage:Impala Pair Drinking.JPG|thumb|240px|Male and female impala drinking at a waterhole\n\n''Aepyceros melampus'' live in big herds and newborn calves join the herd after 1-2 days. They are excellent sprinters and can outrun many predators. Males have impressive horns which are mainly used for fights over females rather than as a defence weapon.\n\nThe impala can be distinguished from other antelopes by its distinctive backside, marked with white and black stripes that resemble the McDonald's logo.  Impala are hunted by lions and leopards, although in reality they are hard to catch, because the whole herd will jump and run around, totally confusing the hunting animal.\n\n====Kudu==== \nImage:Kudo_Kruger_National_Park.JPG|thumb|240px|Kudu during the hot daytime\n''Tragelaphus strepsiceros'' is a big antelope and is very common in the Kruger National Park. Calves are born outside of the herd and are kept in a secret location for 1-2 weeks before they join the herd. They are loved in the national park, but farmers hate them because a 2-m-high fence does not stop them from entering farm premises and eating the crops. \n\n====Puku====\n\n''Kobus vardonii'' are common in Zambia, but not common elsewhere.  Usually found in small herds of about half a dozen, puku have large lyre-shaped horns, reddish-brown fur and lack the backside markings of impala and waterbucks.\n\n====Red Hartebeest====\nImage:Africa-Red_Hartebeest01.jpg|thumb|240px|Red Hartebeest in the [[Krugersdorp Game Reserve]]\n''Alcelphus buselaphus'' can be found in Botswana, Namibia and South Africa\n\n====Springbok==== \nimage:Antidorcas marsupialis 2.jpg|thumb|240px|Springbok\n''Antidorcas marsupialis''\n\nOften mistaken for impalas, because they look like a small impala. However their colour is different and they prefer living in the wide open fields of the arid regions of southern and southwestern Africa. They are very difficult to spot, especially in high grass.\n\n====Thomson's gazelle==== \nimage:2009-thom-gazelle.jpg|thumb|240px|Male Thomson's gazelle\n''Eudorcas thomsonii''\n\nEssentially East Africa's equivalent of the springbok; the two are quite similar in size, coloration, and habitat preference. Probably the best-known of the gazelle species.\n\n====Waterbuck====\nImage:Waterbuck Male.JPG|thumb|240px|Male waterbuck with 'toilet seat' ring\n\n''Kobus ellipsiprymnus'' is a medium-size antelope with grey-brown fur and distinctive backside markings.  There are two types: one has white ring often likened to sitting on a just-painted toilet seat, while the other has a solid white circle.\n\n===Other mammals===\n\n====Aardvark====\n\n\nThe Aardvark (''Orycteropus afer, sometimes also called antbear or anteater'') is a medium-sized mammal. The name comes from the Afrikaans/Dutch for ''earth pig'' (\"aarde\" earth, \"varken\" pig), because early settlers from Europe thought it resembled a pig. However, the Aardvark is not closely related to pigs.\n\n====Bat-Eared Fox====\n\n\nThe Bat-eared Fox is named after its huge ears. Bat-eared Foxes have tawny fur, their ears, legs and parts of the face are black. They are 55 cm in length (head and body), their ears are 13 cm long. It is the only species in the genus Otocyon. The teeth of the Bat-eared Fox are much smaller than teeth of other dog species. This is an adaptation to their insectivorous diet. 80% of the diet consists of insects. Bat-eared Foxes visit termite hills, follow locust swarms or stay close to herds of zebras or antelopes in order to feed on the insects landing on their excrements. In addition to insects Bat-eared Foxes eat rodents, birds and eggs, and sometimes fruits. Bat-eared Foxes are nocturnal animals that live in small groups consisting of a couple and their young. The pairs live in dens and raise the pups (two to five) together.\n\n\n====Buffalo==== \nImage:Buffalo Herd.JPG|thumb|240px|Herd of buffalo\n\n''Syncerus caffer'' are fierce beasts; males may reach up to 700 kg in weight.  They live in herds and have a strong social bond. They can form groups of up to several thousand members when the environment permits and groups are organized by dominant males and females. Predators are actively attacked to defend calves, injured or old members. Mothers give birth to 40-kg calves which are capable of walking shortly after birth. Calves are weaned after seven months, but stay close with their mum for 12 months. Their preferred habitat is savannah with thicket or open savannah, with protective properties. \n\n\n====Dwarf mongoose==== \nImage:Ichneumon_Kruger_National_Park.JPG|thumb|240px|Playful Dwarf mongoose nearby a camp site\n\n''Helogale parvule'' live in social groups with one dominant breeding pair and the rest of the group assisting with raising the offspring. The mongoose is active during daytime . They run quickly into their tunnels when they are frightened but they return quickly and are amusing to watch. They are often found close to streams, rivers, ponds, as well as along open camp sites surrounded by high grass and thicket. The mongoose lives on insects, small birds and eggs. \n\n====Elephant==== \nImage:Elephant Walking.JPG|thumb|240px|Elephant walking\n\nMost authorities now recognize two separate species of African elephant—''Loxodonta africana'', the '''African bush elephant''', and ''Loxodonta cyclotis'', the '''African forest elephant'''. The bush elephant is the largest land mammal in the world; the forest elephant is the third-largest (with the related Asian elephant falling in between). Almost all elephant viewing in Africa is of bush elephants, whose typical habitat is far more open and accessible than the forest elephant's home range in the Congo Basin.     \n \n''Loxodonta africana'' are among the most common sightings in the Kruger National Park and you will be able to see them very close up. Amboseli in Kenya is famous for the biggest tusker in the world. For some it may be too close &amp;mdash; it is definitely not for a fainthearted visitor.\n\nBush elephants are the biggest land mammals in the world. A male can weigh up to 6,000 kg and a female up to 3,500 kg. They live in large family groups led by the most experienced females. Males are only tolerated until a certain age when they have to leave the family and often form bachelor groups. Males join the female group when they are in musth but only the strongest bulls are tolerated.\n\nBush elephants can often be seen around rivers when they have a bath and a good sip of water. They must drink up to 160 litres of water and eat several hundred kilograms of plants per day to survive. Elephants are active at both day and night time. They are peaceful creatures and only become aggressive when they are wounded or when they feel driven to protect their young. \n\n\n====Giraffe==== \nImage:Giraffe Walking Square.JPG|thumb|240px|Thornicroft's giraffe\n\n''Giraffa camelopardalis'' are the tallest mammals on earth. Males reach a height of up to 5.2 metres and females 4.7 metres. Giraffes have a maximum mass of 1400 kg.  In addition to the common giraffe, a subspecies known as '''Thornicraft's giraffe''', with white legs and faces, inhabits Zambia's South Luangwa National Park.\n\nGiraffes give birth after 450 days of pregnancy to a single calf of up to 100 kg and the calf can instantly stand on four legs and walks soon after. Giraffes live in loose family groups and newborn calves join the group after one week. Young giraffes grow fast and reach one meter in height within six months. Family groups can range in from 4 to up to 30 members, but the structure is loose and fluctuations are common.\n\nGiraffes are browsers and can reach leaves that are not accessible by any other ground-based mammal. To maintain such an enormous size as a herbivore, giraffes eat for up to 20 hours a day and rest only during the hottest hours of the day. \n\n\n====Hippopotamus==== \nImage:Hippo Baby.JPG|thumb|240px|Juvenile and adult hippo\n\n''Hippopotamus amphibius'' tolerate direct sunlight poorly, so during the day they are often spotted lurking in the river, little more than their nostrils visible.  They come out to graze during the night.  Hippo calves have a birth mass of around 30 kg and are dependent on their mothers for 5 months. After that, they start to graze. \n\nHippos are said to account for more deaths than any other African mammal: keep well clear of these unpredictable beasts, and ensure that they have a clear path to retreat to water.\n\n\n====Honey Badger==== \nImage:Africa-Honey Badger01.jpg|thumb|240px|Honey Badger at De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Sanctuary\n\n''Mellivora capensis'' does not actually eat honey, but will raid bee hives for the larvae. These are tough little creatures that can even survive bites of venomous snakes.\n\n====Meerkat==== \nImage:Africa-Meerkat01.jpg|thumb|240px|Meerkat\n\n''Suricata suricatta'' is a tiny mammal and part of the mongoose family. A group of meerkats is called a \"mob\" or \"gang\". Meerkat is a loan word from Afrikaans phrasebook|Afrikaans. The name came from Dutch but by misidentification. In Dutch phrasebook|Dutch meerkat (''as Meerkatze in German phrasebook|German'') means guenon, a monkey of the Cercopithecus genus which possibly derives from Sanskrit markata (monkey). The traders of the Dutch East India Company were likely familiar with such animals, but the Dutch settlers attached the name to the wrong animal at the Cape. In Dutch the name for the suricate is stokstêrtje (\"little stick-tail\"). According to African popular belief, the meerkat is also known as the sun angel, as it protects villages from the moon devil or the werewolf which is believed to attack stray cattle or lone tribesmen. They are fascinating to watch and you could easily do so for hours. These little rascals are also the stars of the highly acclaimed [http://animal.discovery.com/ Animal Planet] program ''Meerkat Manor''. Tours are available to see them at sunrise from Oudtshoorn, South Africa.\n\n====Pangolin==== \n\n''Pangolins'' have large scales on their skin and their name is derived from the Malay word pengguling (\"something that rolls up\"). The physical appearance of pangolins is marked by large, hardened, plate-like scales. The scales, which are soft on newborn pangolins but harden as the animal matures, are made of keratin, the same material of which human fingernails are made. It can curl up into a ball when threatened, with its overlapping scales acting as armour. The scales are razor-sharp, and provide extra defense for this reason. The front claws are so long that they are unsuited for walking, and so the animal walks in a hunched-over manner on its hind legs, balanced by its large tail. The pangolin can also emit a noxious smelling acid from glands near the anus, similar to the spray of a skunk. Pangolins have short legs, with sharp claws which they use for burrowing.\n\n\n====Rhinoceros==== \nImage:2_white_rhinos_small_KNP.JPG|thumb|240px|Rhino mother with Calf\nAfrica has two species of rhino—''Ceratotherium simum'', the '''white rhino''', and ''Diceros bicornis'', the '''black rhino'''. They are among the rarest of all large African mammals. The most common subspecies is the southern white rhino, with an estimated wild population of over 20,000. The northern white, on the other hand, is all but extinct, with no known wild specimens and only two, both female, known in captivity (the last known male died in 2018). The black rhino has three surviving subspecies, with a combined wild population approaching 5,000. Hunted to near-extinction in the 1970s and 1980s, herds have been reintroduced into select parks around the continent and are now slowly growing again.\n\nThere is no difference in colour between the \"Whites\" and the \"Blacks\". The White Rhino differs from the Black Rhinoceros because of the shape of its mouth – it is wide, for cropping large swaths of grass. According to one theory, the term \"White\" actually comes from the Afrikaans word \"weit\", meaning 'wide'.\n\nCalves can stand immediately after birth, but they are very slow at walking. After one month they can follow their mother grazing and stay close to their mother for up to three years.  \n\n\n====Warthog==== \nImage:Warthogs Eating.JPG|thumb|240px|Warthogs grazing \n\n''Phacochoerus aethiopicus'' are medium sized mammals with a mixed diet. Warthog babies are born at the beginning of the rainy season (December-January) and live for the first 6-7 weeks in their burrow and then start to follow their mothers. Note their interesting habit of bending their front legs to graze!\n\n\n====Zebra==== \nImage:Zebra Side.JPG|thumb|240px|Crawshay's zebra\nAfrica features three species of zebra.\n\nThe '''plains zebra''' (''Equus quagga'') is common in national parks throughout eastern and southern Africa and easily recognized due to its striking white and black stripes. It is divided into seven subspecies, of which six still exist (the quagga, ''E. q. quagga'', was hunted to extinction in the late 19th century). '''Burchell's zebra''' is one of the more common subspecies, with gray \"shadow\" stripes, while the rarer '''Crawshay's zebra''' (found in Zambia's South Luangwa National Park|South Luangwa) lack these.  The '''mountain zebra''' (''E. zebra''), a separate endangered species, is found in the dry and hilly regions of southern Africa, notably the Mountain Zebra National Park. The third and physically largest species, '''Grévy's zebra''' (''E. grevyi''), found only in small parts of Kenya and Ethiopia, is even more endangered than the mountain zebra and is strongly protected in both countries.\n\nSome national parks in Kenya and Tanzania support groups of thousands of zebras.  The mare leaves the herd to give birth to the foal and rejoins after birth.\n\n==Reptiles==\n===Crocodiles===\nImage:Crocodile Basking.JPG|thumb|240px|Crocodile basking in the sunshine\n\nAfrica has six species of crocodile. All live along rivers and are successful hunters\n\nThe '''Nile crocodile''' (''Crocodylus niloticus'') is the largest, most aggressive, and most widely distributed of these. It ranges throughout most of sub-Saharan Africa, and is also found along the west coast of Madagascar. They control their body temperature by lying in the sun to warm up in winter or to cool down in water in the hot summer. Modern DNA testing has found that it is more closely related to crocodilians of the Americas than to the other African species.\n\nThe '''West African crocodile''' (''C. suchus'') was believed to be a subspecies of the Nile crocodile until being reclassified as a separate species in the 21st century. While not quite as large or aggressive as its Nile cousin, it is still a formidable predator. It ranges widely through Central and West Africa, and some populations even survive in the Sahel and Sahara, staying dormant in caves and burrows during the driest periods and emerging with the rains.\n\nThe '''West African slender-snouted crocodile''' (''Mecistops cataphractus'') is a critically endangered medium-sized crocodile found in that region. It feeds mainly on fish and small invertebrates. \n\nThe '''Central African slender-snouted crocodile''' (''M. leptorhynchus'') was believed to be the same species as its West African cousin until being confirmed in the 2010s as a separate species. It is also classified as critically endangered, and has much the same dietary preferences as the West African species.\n\nThe '''dwarf crocodile''' (''Osteolaemus tetraspis'') is either the smallest, or among the smallest, species of crocodile, with the largest specimens being barely above 1.9 m (6.2 ft) in length. It ranges through West Africa. In the 2020s, one species has already been split from it, and many scientists believe that the current population is actually two separate species. \n\n'''Osborn's dwarf crocodile''' (''O. osborni''), found in the Congo Basin, was split from ''O. tetraspis'' in the 2020s.\n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;\n\n===Leopard tortoise===\nImage:Leopard_tortoise_KNP.JPG|thumb|240px|Leopard tortoise \n\n''Geochelone pardalis'' can be best spotted on tarred roads (they are virtually invisible in the high grass from a car). They like to drink water from tarred roads. \n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;\n\n==Birds==\n===African Black Oystercatcher===\n\n''Haematopus moquini'' can be found along the South African and Namibian coastline.\n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;\n\n===Blue Crane===\nImage:Southern_Africa-Blue_Crane.jpg|thumb|240px|The Blue Crane\n\n''Anthropooedes paradisea'' is the national bird of South Africa and also the symbol of the Zulu Royal House.\n\nFound almost exclusively in South Africa (''less than 100 still remain in Namibia''), these birds are under threat with populations declining rapidly and less than 30,000 remaining in the wild.\n\n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;\n\n===Cape Sugarbird===\n\n''Promerops cafer'' can be found in the Western Cape.\n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;\n\n===Carmine-chested bee-eater===\nImage:Coracias caudatus (Crop).jpg|thumb|240px|Carmine-chested bee-eater\n\n''Merops nubicoides'' is a bird that preys on insects such as bees and grasshoppers, easily recognized by its striking red chest and even more striking blue wings (only clearly visible in flight).  It breeds in Zimbabwe and Transvaal, but can occasionally be seen in flocks of hundreds &amp;mdash; a stunning sight.\n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;\n\n===Crowned Plover===\nImage:Unknown_bird_KNP.JPG|thumb|240px|Crowned Plover, Vanellus coronatus\n''Vanellus coronatus''\n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;\n\n===Darter===\n\n''Anhinga rufa'' can be spotted close to dams, when drying their feathers from a previous dive. \n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;\n\n===Fish eagle===\nImage:AfricanFishEagle.JPG|thumb|240px|Fish eagle looking for prey\n\n''Haliaeetus vocifer'' is a fish hunter and can be spotted along the Sabie river in South Africa. \n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;\n\n===Ground hornbill===\nImage:Southern Ground Hornbill KNP.jpg|thumb|240px|Group of four southern ground hornbills \nBoth living species of '''ground hornbill'''&amp;mdash;not to be confused with just \"hornbill\"&amp;mdash; make their homes in Africa. These ground-dwelling birds grow up to about a metre in height and weigh about 2-6 kg when fully grown. The '''southern ground hornbill''' is slightly larger than the '''Abyssinian ground hornbill''', and has a less distinctive horn. Their ranges don't overlap much, so you can typically tell them apart based on location. Their plumage is generally black, with either red (males) or blue (females) colour on their throats. Both species are endangered and there are citizen-science tracking projects for enthusiastic travellers to help report about them.\n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;\n\n===Helmeted guineafowl===\n\n\n''Numida meleagris'' can be spotted often in small groups along roads when they are picking insects or seeds. \n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;\n\n===Hornbill===\n\n24 species of '''hornbill''' are native to Africa. Hornbills are characterised by their long, frequently brightly-coloured, bills which curve down. These monogomous birds typically feed on fruit and small animals, with varying ranges &amp;ndash; some prefer dense forests, whilst most prefer open woodlands and savanna or even semi-desert. Most species of hornbill in Africa are medium sized birds, typically around 40-80 cm in length.\n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;\n\n===Ostrich===\n.]]\n\nThe two existing species of ostrich—the '''common ostrich''' (''Struthio camelus'') and '''Somali ostrich''' (''S. molybdophanes'')—are the biggest birds on earth. They can grow up to two metres. They eat grass, berries and seeds and normally live in family groups. Males are coloured white and black, while females are of a brownish colour. The two species are distinguished mainly by the color of their neck and thighs—pink for the common ostrich, and greyish-blue for the Somali ostrich. They also differ in their habitat preferences; the Somali ostrich tends to feed by browsing in more thickly vegetated areas, while the common ostrich mainly grazes on open savanna. Ostrich eggs are the largest of any animal, weighing up to 1.4 kg/3.1 lb, but interestingly are the smallest of all bird eggs relative to the size of the adult. \n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;\n\n===Redbilled oxpecker=== \nImage:Springbock_with_threadworm_eating_bird_on_its_back_Kruger_National_Park.JPG|thumb|240px|Impala with bird on its back (Redbilled oxpecker)\n\n''Buphagus erythrorhynchus'' give relief to grazing animals by removing ticks from the skin of Kudu, Impala and Steenbok. \n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;\n\n===Spottedbacked weaver===\nImage:Spottedbacked_weaver_KNP.JPG|thumb|240px|Spottedbacked weaver \n\nThis is a very colourful yellow bird with characteristic hanging nests.

As its name suggests it is full of thorns and only specialist herbivores can eat its leaves without suffering from the thorn defence (see also Giraffe).\n\n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;\n\n===Paperbark Thorn===\nImage:Africa-Acacia_sieberiana_01.jpg|thumb|240px|Paperbark Thorn \n''Acacia sieberiana'' is common throughout Southern Africa and is often the tree used to give photographs that ''African'' feeling since the ''umbrealla'' it forms is generally very well defined.\n\n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;\n\n===King Protea===\nImage:South_Africa-King_Protea01.jpg|thumb|240px|King Protea \n''Protea cynaroides''\n\nThe National flower of South Africa.\n\n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;\n\n===Aloe===\nImage:South_Africa-Aloe01.jpg|thumb|240px|Aloe field \nAloe is common throughout Southern Africa.\n\n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;\n\n===Weeping boer-bean===\nImage:Weeping_boer-bean_KNP.JPG|thumb|240px|Weeping boer bean \n\n''Schotia brachypetala'' is a tree that prefers wet ground and is commonly found on river banks and flowers only after years of good rainfall. Beautiful red flowers appear in September to October.\n\n===Welwitschia===\nImage:Welwitschia mirabilis(2).jpg|thumb|240px|The \"Big Welwitschia\", the largest known member of its species \n\nOne of the world's most unique plants, ''Welwitschia mirabilis'' is (depending on the authority) the only living member of either its family or its order. To put this into perspective, the order Artiodactyla, which includes antelope, bison, buffalo, camels, cattle, deer, giraffes, goats, goat-antelopes, hippos, pigs, and whales (not a complete list), has over 20 families and nearly 350 existing species. Welwitschia are endemic to the northern half of the Namib Desert along the coast of southern Angola and northern Namibia. After germination, two leaves develop at the edge of a woody crown. While the crown grows to no more than 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in height (as in the example pictured at right), the outside edges of the leaves split over time and can spread over a circumference as great as 8 m (26 ft). The species has separate male and female plants, with insects as the pollinators. Welwitschia are thought to be among the longest-lived plants, with some possibly being more than 2,000 years old. While not immediately threatened, it is vulnerable to overgrazing, disease, and damage from off-road vehicles. Populations in Angola are better protected because land mines laid during that country's past civil war have kept collectors away. \n\n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n* Zoos\n\n"

                    "text": "\n'''Afrikaans''' is spoken throughout South Africa and Namibia. The language is mainly derived from Dutch phrasebook|Dutch but has been influenced by the Malay phrasebook|Malay language. However, most Afrikaans speakers in the workplace have some knowledge of English and increasingly, those who have studied at a tertiary-level establishment are instructed in English.\n\n==Pronunciation guide==\n===Vowels===\n; a : as in s'''u'''n\n; e : as in m'''e'''t but sometimes as in m'''ee'''t or ang'''e'''l\n; ê : as in '''a'''pple\n; ë : usually pronounced the same as 'e', but when it is accented due to grammar, such as in words like 'geëet' which means 'to have eaten', it can be pronounced three other ways: m'''ee'''t, f'''ea'''r or '''we'''t\n; i : as in  b'''i'''t\n; o : as in f'''o'''rt or m'''oo'''d or b'''oy'''\n; ô : as in c'''au'''ldron\n; u : as in ''u'' in h'''u'''t with rounded lips\n; y : as in ''ay'' in s'''ay''', which is the Dutch equivalent ''ij'', \n; 'n :  in 'a' as in ''''a''' dog' or ''''a''' song'. This is the article; it is never capitalised even if used at the start of a sentence: the word that follows is capitalised.\n\nNote that Afrikaans pronunciation is extremely difficult and can be a challenge, even for Dutch speakers.\n\n===Consonants===\n; b : as in '''b'''at\n; c : as in '''k'''ing (uncommon, usually proper nouns e.g. 'Coetzee'\n; d : as in '''d'''ance but pronounced as English 't' at the end of words\n; f : as in '''f'''an\n; g : similarly to the 'ch' in ba'''ch''', but a lot harder and more glottal - a bit like hawking up phlegm :-).\n; h : as in '''h'''at\n; j : as in '''y'''ak\n; k : as in '''k'''ing\n; l : as in '''l'''amp\n; m : as in '''m'''an\n; n : as in '''n'''ap\n; p : as in '''p'''et\n; r : as in '''r'''ant, but the sound is rolled\n; s : as in '''s'''et\n; t : as in '''t'''ale\n; v : same as the English 'f'\n; w : pronounced the same as the English 'v' as in '''v'''et\n; x : as in fi'''x''' but extremely rare, usually found in scientific terms or loanwords.\n; z : as in blit'''z'''\n\nIn some loan words, 'g', 'v' and 'w' may be pronounced the same as their English equivalents, but this is uncommon.\n\n===Digraphs and trigraphs===\n; aa : as in f'''a'''ther\n; ae : two sounds, one after another, quite quickly. Starts as 'aa' and is quickly finished off with the Afrikaans 'a' as in d'''u'''st \n; ch : can be pronounced in three ways: lo'''ch''' or '''sh'''ine or '''k'''ing\n; kk : as in '''c'''ane\n; nn : as in ma'''n'''\n; sj : as in ma'''ch'''ine\n; ee : as in f'''ea'''r\n; eë : as in f'''ea'''r but pronounced as two separate sounds. Sounds almost like 'ee-ye'\n; ië : same as eë\n; ei : as is s'''a'''le\n; eu : pronounced two ways: as in '''ea'''r or as in m'''ew'''\n; gh : same as English 'gh'. For example: '''gh'''ost\n; ll : as in '''l'''amp\n; mm : as in '''m'''end\n; ie : pronounced either as long 'ee' like in br'''ee'''d or as 'i' in s'''i'''ck\n; kn : as in pi'''ck 'n''' pay\n; ng : as in si'''ng'''\n; nk : as in thi'''nk'''\n; oe : pronounced either as the long 'oo' as in l'''oo'''t or as a short 'oo' as in f'''oo'''t\n; oë : as in English d'''oe'''r\n; oo : same as German \"ü\", make your lips into the position of \"o\" but say \"ee\" instead.\n; ou : as in c'''oa'''t\n; rs : like fa'''rse''', but the 'r' is rolled\n; tj : as in '''ch'''unk\n; tj : combined with '''ie''' as in '''ki'''d\n; ui : also a unique sound. Sounds like pl'''ay''' but with pouted lips. The name sh'''a'''ne is the closest English equivalent\n; uu : similar to German '''ü'''ber but pronounced with more emphasis and much longer. Identical to the final 'yy' sound\n; aai : like the 'y' in sh'''y''', but a pronounced a lot longer. \n; eeu : A unique trigraph. The closest English equivalent is the English word ewe. Try blending the sounds 'ew' and 'oo'\n; oei : similar to ph'''ooey''' but pronounced with a rapid 'w' in it\n; ooi : similar to '''oi'''l but pronounced with a rapid 'w' in it\n; uie : similar to pl'''aye'''r but pronounced much longer\n\n===Note on Afrikaans===\n\nLike English, double consonants in Afrikaans are pronounced as a single sound, and not two separate sounds, unless occurring at a syllabary break: 'wekker': 'vack-er' (alarm clock) but 'melkkoei': 'melk-koo-ee' (milking cow).\n\nNote that although Afrikaans digraphs and trigraphs contain mostly vowels and sound as though they contain many syllables, they in fact are seen as a single syllable.\n\nFor example, the word 'Goeie' sounds as if it contains 3 syllables, but in fact contains only two: 'goei' and 'e' are the 2 syllables.\n\nFrom this, you can see Afrikaans pronunciation, like English for a foreigner, can be rather irregular. Pronunciation can be hard and the accent is extremely difficult to master, but when spoken correctly, Afrikaans is the most melodic Germanic language.\n\nHowever, one should not be daunted. Afrikaans grammar is really quite simple and is more similar to English than to any other Germanic language. Verbs are even simpler than English: there is no ''am'' or ''are'' or ''were'' but only ''is'' and ''was''.\n\nOne who is learning Afrikaans will probably catch onto it rather quickly and will have no problem with speaking Dutch or understanding German.\n\n==Important differences between Dutch and Afrikaans==\n\nWhen new concepts are developed, the Dutch will often adapt the English word whereas the Afrikaaners will invent their own word.  Thus the Afrikaans word will make sense to a Dutch-speaker even though the Dutch-speaker themselves would not use the word.\n\nA ''rukkie'' in Afrikaans is a short period of time, not a sexual act performed on oneself. Common use examples are ''Ek gaan 'n rukkie slaap'' or ''Ek sal oor 'n rukkie daar wees''\n\nCertain words in Afrikaans are also derived from Malay and might therefore not be understood by Dutch speakers.  Such words include \"baklei (\"fight\" or in Dutch \"vecht\"), \"piesang\" (\"banana\" or in Dutch \"banaan\") and \"baie\" (\"many\" or in Dutch \"veel\"), though the word \"veel\" is also widely used in Afrikaans.\n\n==Phrase list==\n===Basics===\n\n\n\n; Hello.

It lies nearly on the banks of the Saint Croix River, which forms the natural eastern border between Minnesota and Wisconsin.\n\n==Understand==\nAfton was originally settled in 1837 by a French-Canadian voyageur. In the following decades Afton would become the home for a large concentration of Swedes and Germans. Today, Afton serves as one of the last stops in Minnesota before a traveler plunges into the harsh beauty of the Wisconsin countryside. It is a lovely community with nearly 3,000 individuals living inside the city limits.\n\n==Get in==\nFrom the capital city of Saint Paul potential visitors can easily reach Afton by traveling nine miles east on Interstate 94 before heading south on Minnesota State Highway 95, which is also known as Saint Croix Trail. The town of Afton lies directly in the path of this road and is no more than three miles south of the Interstate 94 exit/entrance.\n\n==Get around==\n\nThe downtown area of Afton is compact enough to be easily traversable on foot. Still, as there is next to nothing in the public transit department access to a car is, like most of the United States, somewhat of a necessity. The only other option is to perhaps strap-on some Lance Armstrong spandex, brush the dust off your bicycle and take to the road.

The most significant threat to public safety comes from the high level of deer that are native to the surrounding forests. It is not uncommon to have a nighttime drive interrupted by a shocking jolt of adrenaline due to these impish mammals suddenly appearing on the side of darkened road. '''Constant''' '''vigilance''' is strongly suggested during the night in order to avoid a costly accident.\n\n==Go next==\n\n\n\n\n"

It is the largest city in the Jezreel Valley and the capital of that region.\n\n==Understand==\nDating back at least since the 11th century, but possible several thousand more years. Afula remained a small village but became somewhat of a logistics node when the Jezreel Valley railway was inaugurated in 1904. The whole town was bought in 1925 by American Zionist Commonwealth as part of the ''Sursock Purchase'', the largest Jewish land acquisition during Mandatory Palestine. About one hundred Arab families who had lived in the area either accepted compensation for their land and left voluntarily or were evicted. In the following decades Afula saw a large influx of Jewish immigrants and it has grown into a modern and well-developed town, however lacking in tourist sights.\n\n== Get in ==\n\n===By bus or taxi===\nYou can use buses from Tel Aviv (825, 840), Haifa (300, 301), Jerusalem (953) and Tiberias (541, 840). From other cities in the valley (Migdal Ha'emek, Bet Shean, Nazareth) you can get to Afula by [http://www.superbus.co.il '''Superbus'''] buses or by sherut (shared) taxis. Sherut taxis also available from Tel-Aviv, Haifa and Tiberias. Note that buses departing from Afula to bigger cities stops at 22:00.\n\n==== From the West Bank ====\nFrom Jenin (also applicable to Nablus and Ramallah): Take a shared taxi (sherut/serviis) or hitchhike to the border, and cross on foot. From the Israeli side of the border, taxis to Afula cost ₪40-50. Alternatively, you can take bus 52 from the roundabout after the border into Afula (₪7.40).\n\n* \n\n===By train===\nThere is a train every one hour from Haifa and from Beit She'an. Local buses are synced with train arrivals and departures. Notice that buses from Nazareth does not stop directly at the railway station.\n\n* \n\n==Get around==\n\n\n\n===By bus===\nSuperbus operates 10 internal bus lines (2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 13, 14, 19, 20) inside Afula. Lines 10 and 11 have a nearly identical route except the section at city center and both have very high frequency of every 10 minutes combined. Line 20 is a special line to the market and it operated on Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday only. The line's frequency is every 30 minutes. Line 19 has few stops in the city but it continues to the towns Marhavia and Sulam. The line's frequency is every 60 minutes.

The area is dotted with similar volcanic plugs, and underground heat makes this a geothermal area, with many hotel spas. These and the collection of mosques around the foot of the citadel are the main reason to visit.\n\n== Understand ==\n\n''Afyon - kara - hisar'' literally means \"opium black fortress\". This is a large growing area for opium poppies - the open fields have been burned out to curb the illegal trade but production continues under tight control for medicinal opiates such as morphine.\n\nAfyon produces fine marble, the Docimian Pavonazzetto variety being white with purple veins. The quarries are ugly places and the best place to admire the marble is in the many grand buildings it has gone to adorn, such as the Pantheon and St Peter's in Rome, and Hagia Sophia in Istanbul.\n\nIn 2004 the Turkish parliament decided it didn't like having a city called Opium (maybe too much confusion with YSL perfume?) and changed the name to Afyonkarahisar. \"Afyon\" is what it remains locally and on this page, but you might want to give it the full name when explaining your travel plans to border guards.\n\n== Get in ==\n\n=== By bus ===\nBuses from Istanbul run every hour or two, taking 7 hours via Gebze, Izmit, Adapazarı and Kütahya, for a fare in 2022 of 230 TL.

It is a picturesque and lively community that has kept all the characteristics of a rural seafront village and also offers excellent dining and entertainment options. Athytos is certainly one of the most beautiful villages in Kassandra peninsula. The village's beautiful stone houses with the distinctive architecture and the inscriptions and reliefs, are very interesting. Athytos is known for its rich cultural tradition. During the summer, you can attend numerous events such as music and dance performances, visual arts events, painting exhibitions and folkloric events.\n\n===History===\nSince about 3000 BCE people came and settled in the area where Afytos is now. The place was a natural fortress, which was a very important factor at the time. The crag would protect the city against any attacks from the sea. Also, the little lake that existed till 1963, and which was very close to the sea, would serve as a small bay, a natural harbor for the mooring of ships.\n\nDuring the archaic and classical times, Afytos was a very prosperous city which minted its own currency bearing the head of its patron god, Ammon Zeus. This prosperity was mainly due to agriculture and viniculture.\n\nShipping must have played a great role in the financial situation of Afytos, taking into consideration the size of its harbor, which is to be found today in the seaside park with the pine trees.\n\nIn 1307–1309, the village was destroyed by Catalan invaders and the inhabitants settled, for a period of time, in their scattered farm houses. Afytos had been destroyed numerous times by the invaders of the times. The last catastrophe recorded was the one in 1821 during the Greek revolution against the Turkish oppression.\n\nIn 1995, the inhabitants of Aphytos, resisting the wide use of concrete in modern villages, and supporting the initiatives of the then president of the village, Vasili Pavli, pushed forward the idea of a traditional village by re-erecting the old stone houses, paving the streets, creating pavements, etc. So the old local porous stone quarries reopened and today every contemporary edifice is built with the local stone.\n\n==Get in==\nIt is about a 1 hour drive without traffic from Thessaloniki on the A24. Afytos is also served by the KTEL bus from Thessaloniki on KTEL taking between 65-85 minutes with multiple daily departures. The fare is €8.70 as of October 2022.\n\n==Get around==\nThe village is high above the beach and the path steep - you need a vehicle if you are not good on foot\n\n==See==\nVisit the Rock - the \"Village Balcony\" - and Koutsomylos - the \"Village Acropolis\" - to admire the fascinating view of the bay of Toroni, Sithonia and Kassandra.\n\n==Do==\n==Buy==\n==Eat==\n==Drink==\n==Sleep==\n* double\n| checkin= | checkout=\n| lastedit=2018-12-04\n| content=\n}}\n* +\n| checkin= | checkout=\n| content=}}\n*\n\n==Connect==\n\n==Go next==\n\n\n\n\n"

Agadez was held by the Mali Empire during part of the 14th century, captured by the Songhai Empire in 1515, and controlled by Bornu in the 17th century. It remained a trade center until the late 19th century. During much of this time it was a center of Islamic learning and the seat of several sultanates before its capture by the French in 1900. \n\nIt is a center of Tuareg culture, and of unrest: there have been Tuareg rebellions in 1990-1995 and 2007-present. The Tuareg are renowned for their metal and leather workings. The region around Agadez is known for its spectacular desert and mountain scenery. It is also the center of one of the largest uranium mining regions on Earth.\n\nThe historic centre of Agadez was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2013.\n\n=== Climate ===\n\n\nAgadez has a desert climate with temperatures exceeding  during July and August.

Those of the Muslim faith believe that the arms of the cross will disperse all evil from the individual, thus keeping him out of harms way. Tuareg parents are known to give these exquisite silver crosses to their children when they are about to depart from home but they are worn by all as a form of good luck and protection. The silver crosses are uniquely shaped and are named after the town of Agadez from where they originate. The cross bears the jeweler's mark on its back. The beaded necklace contains four cylindrical decoratively embossed silver segments.\n\nThe Touareg crosses sold come in a number of designs.  The Agadez cross is the most common, but many others are available.  Each design is associated with a particular Touareg market town.  Other examples include the Timia cross, the Iferouane cross and the unusual Ingal cross.\n\nLeather and silver handicrafts are common.\n\n==Eat==\n* \n\n==Drink==\n\n==Sleep==\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Stay safe==\n\nSee the warning on the Niger article.\n\n==Go next==\nThere is not much around Agadez to visit. \n* '''Air and Ténéré Natural Reserve'''\n* '''Aïr mountains'''\n* '''Tuareg festival''' in Iferouane\n\n\n\n"

                    "text": "\n'''Agadir''' (Moroccan Arabic phrasebook|Moroccan Arabic: أݣادير) is a city in the southern part of Morocco. Agadir is a tourist resort that is popular with European travelers and Moroccans alike. It has a beach with all the appropriate facilities for ''beach-tourism''. The city is especially attractive, it is clean and orderly with very friendly locals.\n\n==Understand==\n\nAgadir is of interest primarily because of its location, as it is surrounded by the Anti Atlas, the Western Sahara|Sahara Desert, many natural parks, and secluded beaches which are all easily accessible from Agadir.\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By plane===\n*  | url=https://aeroport-agadir.com/ | email=\n| address= | lat=30.325 | long=-9.413056 | directions=20 km southeast of the city\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\n| hours= | price=\n| wikidata=Q1416280|wikipedia=Agadir–Al Massira Airport\n| lastedit=2018-01-01\n| content=Agadir has an international airport with direct flights coming from major cities in Europe as well as many charter flights arriving from all over Europe. If you are flying from the US, Canada, Asia or elsewhere, you'll have to change planes in Casablanca.\n}}\n\n'''Getting there:''' Official taxi costs 200 dirham plus 20 dirham per each bag. Cheaper taxis can be found just outside of the airport, with prices starting at 80-100 dirham (as of Jan 2018). \n\nThere are no direct buses from the airport, however a transit bus #37 can be caught at the main road junction just outside the airport, it goes to Inezgane for 7 dirham every 40&amp;nbsp;minutes or so. From there you'll need to catch another bus for 4 dirham or grand taxi to Agadir for another 7 dirham (as of Jan 2024). \n\nThe Alsa bus company launched the [https://www.alsa.ma/en/airport-shuttle airport shuttle] between the city center and the airport for 50 dirham one way, and or round-trip for 80 dirham per person, as of Jan 2024.\n\nMore international connections and ultra low-cost flights from Europe fly to the airport of Marrakesh. From there you can take an intercity bus to Agadir.\n\n===By train===\nThere is no train connection with Agadir.\n\n===By bus===\n* \n\n* \n\nBetween Essaouira and Agadir it is very easy to catch an intercity bus anywhere along the way. During the day there is one bus about every hour. While CTM and Supratours are not allowed to pick up additional passengers, local intercity buses do not have such a restriction. This is a great way to explore the coast including Taghazout between these two cities without issues. The regular price for the full distance is 50 dirham.\n\n==Get around==\n\n===On foot===\nThe touristy part of the city is small enough to be able to walk it.\n\n===By bus===\nThere is a public bus service which is quite reliable. Fares are usually 3.50-5 dirham, directly paid to the driver, who will hand you a proper ticket. Keep the ticket until the end, there might be controls. Maps can be obtained from the Tourist Office which is along the Boulevard Mohammad V near the Miramar Hotel. Alternatively, also OpenStreetMap has the Agadir bus network available, so get yourself one of the mobile apps using OpenStreetMap, like OsmAnd or Mapy.cz.\n\n===By taxi===\nMost of the Agadir's ''petit taxi'' are quite legal and use the taximeter (you can ask the driver to do it without any problems).\n\nIf you go around the center though, they will ask you normally from 30 to 50 dirham (as of 2019). This is not legal, and you can refuse to pay anything but the price listed on the taximeter if it has been reset at the beginning of the trip.\n\n===By motorbike rental===\nMopeds can be rented around Hotel Kenzi, but they are expensive, more than 100 dirham an hour.\n\n==See==\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Do==\nAgadir is primarily a resort and as such has a limited number of attractions\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* '''Football:''' \n\n==Buy==\nAgadir is maybe the city with the least charm to buy the typical Moroccan handcraft goods. All the ''souk'' is around a big square behind the Uniprix (Blvd. Hassan II with Ave. Sidi Mohammed). There is a concrete building called ''Marché centrale'' with many shops inside. Is possible to get in also from Ave. Prince Moulay Abdallah. All the goods are made outside the Agadir region, and it's difficult to find them at a good price. The good thing of buying in Agadir is that there are many fixed-price shops, which is good if you don't know how to haggle well. In fact, you may find that the cheap things you bought in Marrakech are not so cheap!\n\nIn the Uniprix shop it is possible to buy small typical pieces in maybe the least authentic shop in Morocco, but the prices are not so high and there is nobody pushing you to buy.\n\n* \n\n==Eat==\nThere are four main zones in which to eat in Agadir:\n* New Talbourjt: The cheapest restaurants are here. There are menus for 35 dirham. It's one of the cheapest zones in Morocco for tourists.\n* The beach: Next to the beach, there are many restaurants. You can find from international fast food to Indian food, good fish restaurants, etc. It's the most expensive and tourist zone.\n* Around the Uniprix: It's the mid-price zone. There are tourist restaurants and some restaurants for the local people.\n\nIf you're looking for a quick snack, keep an eye out for the pastry vendors who roam the beach carrying big plastic trays, selling sweet fried bread that are called \"sfinj.\"\n\nBeware, however, that these friendly hawkers will often approach you on the beach, strike up a conversation, and then thrust a pastry into your hand, whether you asked for one or not. Which, of course, you are then expected to pay for (1-2 dirham, ''not'' 5-10). If you don't want to buy, simply refuse the offer with a polite smile. They ''are'' delicious, though.\n\n===Budget===\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Mid-range===\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Splurge===\n\n* \n\n==Drink==\nAgadir is prepared for European tourists, so you can find night clubs in the tourist zones, where you can find more tourists beside the usual locals looking for tourists.\n\nAlcohol is found in all the tourist places and can also be purchased at the Uniprix and Atacadao supermarkets.\n\nIf you are looking just to talk and drink something during the evening, you can go to the nice and big cafes that are at ave. Hassan II, like ''La Fontaine'', ''La Veranda'', ''Le Dome'', etc. It's a real ritual for many Agadir citizens.\n\n==Sleep==\nThe main budget accommodation area is in the Nouveau Tablorjt. A simple double room will set you back around 150–180 dirham although you might find a really basic hotel with crappy toilets for 80 dirham. Arrive early as hotels tend to fill up quickly in high season.\n\nHostels you can find \nin Tamraght and Taghazout, 15km from Agadir.\n\n===Budget===\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Mid-range===\n* \n* \n* \n\n===Splurge===\n* \n* \n\n==Go next==\n* About 40&amp;nbsp;km south from Agadir, there is the '''Souss-Massa|Souss-Massa river national park'''. 1½ hr along the same road is '''Tiznit'''. Another half an hour later '''Mirleft''' and after yet another 30 minutes one is in '''Sidi Ifni'''.\n* At about 80&amp;nbsp;km east from Agadir, there is the city of '''Taroudannt''', which is worth the visit if you don't plan to visit Marrakech or other big historical cities.\n* The coast northern to Agadir has very nice and accessible beaches, like '''Taghazout''' which is 15&amp;nbsp;km away. You can get to these towns by bus #60 and bus #12 that leave from the center of Agadir. Bus #32 runs every 20&amp;nbsp;minutes or so north on Boulevard Mohammend V, 12 dirham.\n* '''Imouzzer''' with its famous cascades is located about 60&amp;nbsp;km northeast of Agadir, although the trip through the mountains will take longer than the distance suggests.\n\n\n\n"

It is speculated that ''Hagåtña'' roughly translates as \"related to Agat\" or \"more/better Agat,\" Agat being a southern Guamanian village where the founders of Hagåtña are thought to have migrated from.\n\nFrom the 18th through mid-20th century, it was Guam's population center; but following heavy bombardment during World War II, much of the village was destroyed and a majority of Hagåtna's population permanently relocated to neighboring villages.

                    "text": "\n'''Agartala''' is the capital city of Tripura, and is the second-largest city in North-Eastern India after Guwahati. It is on the banks of the Haora River, near the Bangladesh border, about 90 km (55 mi) east of Bangladesh's capital Dhaka. Agartala is being developed under the Smart Cities Mission, a flagship scheme of the Government of India, the third international internet gateway after Mumbai and Chennai.\n\n==Understand==\nAgartala is a city of 400,000 people (2011) on a plain along the Haora River, although the city also extends to the low-lying hills on its northern parts.\n\n===Climate===\nAgartala has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate just short of being hot enough to qualify as a borderline tropical savanna/tropical monsoon  climate. Large amounts of rain fall all year except during the dry \"winter\" or \"cool\" season. The city experiences long, hot and wet summers, lasting from April to October. Average temperatures are around 28 °C or 82.4 °F, fluctuating with rainfall. There is a short, mild winter from mid-November to early March, with mostly dry conditions and average temperatures around 18 °C (64 °F). The best time to visit is from September to February. Summers are long and extremely hot with much sunlight and warm days. Rain is very common in this season, and the city can be found flooded. The Haora River flows through the city and remains flooded with water during the time of monsoon.\n\n==Get in==\nYou can get in to Agartala by plane, train and bus.\n\nIf coming via road from Bangladesh, the nearby Akhaura Land Port accepts eVisas. The Cumilla Land Port, further south, does not (July 2023). Exit of Bangladesh incurs a \"Travel Tax\" of 1000 taka.\n\n===By plane===\n*  | url=http://www.aai.aero/allAirports/agartala_generalinfo.jsp | email=\n| address= | lat=23.89 | long=91.242222 | directions=\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\n| hours= | price=\n| wikipedia=Agartala Airport | image=Agartala Airport Departure Terminal.jpeg | wikidata=Q3498094\n| content=Agartala can be reached by air from Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Chennai and many other cities of India via Kolkata or Guwahati. There are also direct flights from Aizawl in Mizoram. Airfare varies from ₹1,800-7,000.\n}}\n\nTo get into the city from the airport, there are infrequent buses, or you can take an auto (tuktuk). There's a counter outside at the pickup and dropoff area where you can buy a ticket for your auto journey at a guaranteed zone-based price, ranging from about ₹200-400 depending on the destination.\n\n===By train===\n\n\nAgartala lies on the Sabroom-Lumding line, with daily trains south, to/from Sabroom, and north, as far as Silchar. Trains to/from further destinations occur less frequently, on alternate days, or even weekly.\n\nThe new ''Tripura Sundari Express'' links Delhi with Agartala once every week via Guwahati. \n\n is just over 5 km south of the city centre. Some regional trains also stop at , which is closer to the city.\n\n===By bus===\nAgartala can be reached directly by bus from Guwahati, Shillong and Silchar. The Akhaura check post also connects Agartala to Dhaka. This route extends to Kolkata in West Bengal.\n\n===By sumo===\nThere's intermittent sumo service (shared SUV) direct from Aizawl in Mizoram, but it only runs when enough passengers have booked seats in advance, which doesn't happen every day. As of May 2023, the cost is ₹1300 per person (or you can \"reserve\" the whole car for ₹13,000). If starting from Aizawl, inquire at the sumo counter inside a convenience store just uphill from Temple Square. The ride is notoriously long and bumpy.\n\n==Get around==\n\nPublic transport like buses along with cabs and taxis can be used to commute around the city.\n\nPedal Rickshaws are the principal mode of travel within the city limits. The fare may range from ₹5-25.\n\nThe battery-operated rickshaws which are locally called ''tomtom'' are very popular because they have the cheapest fares. Some cycle rickshaws have been converted to a battery-operated rickshaw. The drivers are genuine rickshaw drivers from backward classes.\n\nAuto rickshaws plying on fixed routes are also available. Designated stops are at Motorstand, Nagarjala, Abhaynagar, Old RMS, etc. All you need to do to catch an \"auto\" (locally known as \"Tempu\" or \"auto\") is to stand on the route and be watchful. Auto rickshaws have an authorized sitting capacity of 3 persons, and passengers are comfortable squeezing in by little adjustment. Auto-rickshaws are available for travel to the airport also.\n\nGovernment city buses ply throughout the city and its sub-urban areas. The fare ranges from ₹5 to ₹10, but the frequency is low. They ply on 7 routes covering the whole city.\n\nFor a day trip to Kamalasagar, Sipahijala, Udaipur, Neermahal etc. a cab can be hired from Battala syndicate.\n\n==See==\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n* \n* \n* \nimage:Ujjayanta Palace as seen from the Rajbari Lakes.jpg|thumb|Ujjayanta Palace\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Do==\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Buy==\nCane and bamboo artwork is available.\n\n==Eat==\nIndian, Chinese, Continental food is available in any good restaurant in Agartala.And the local food of tiprasa people like gudok, chakhwi, wak (pork) mosdeng are very tasty and appreciated by the non-tribals and tourists.

Excellent street food available and the main street is a hub of activity during the evening where you can get anything from chai to particularly good popcorn.\n* \n*'''Sherwoli Sweets:''' It is near ujjayanto palace. Mini Thali is awesome here. \n\n==Drink==\nAgartala is teeming with liquor shops where cheap brands are easily available. It is not permissible to drink openly on the roads or in public places.\n\n==Sleep==\n\nAs Agartala is still a growing city, you will not find grand old hotels as in other cities, but there are many good hotels.\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Go next==\n\n* '''Domboor Lake and Raima valley''' &amp;mdash; Domboor Lake has 48 islands surrounded by green forests and vegetation.

This place is awesome, but beware of the travel from Agartala to Unakoti. The roads are in very bad condition and taking a train from Agartala to Kumarghat and from there shared rickshaws for about ₹80-100 will take you to Unakoti. It is on the way from Kumarghat to Dharmanagar. This place is totally worth the fun\n\n\n\n"

                    "text": "\n''Wikivoyage articles have a stay safe section with location specific advice. This article contains general information relevant to many destinations.'' \n\n== Understand ==\n, Central Moscow]]\n\n'''Aggressive (stray) dogs''' are a common problem when travelling in places such as Asia, South America and some Eastern European countries like Romania, Albania, or Georgia (country) and, in Western Europe, Portugal. The dogs are often feral (and hence not used to taking commands from people) and may be running wild in packs, which can be extremely intimidating if you are confronted by one. The obvious precautions – travel in groups, avoid areas where the dogs are, don't go out at night when they are most active, and carry a walking stick if you must go – will reduce the risks but not eliminate them.\n\n== Guard dogs ==\nSome guard dogs are aggressive, even to travellers who are merely passing by. While they could be restrained once the owners are alerted and understood that their dogs are causing a nuisance, some advice on feral dogs does apply. However, any actions that hurt guard dogs may lead to legal consequences, unless you are really attacked by them. Remember that these dogs are protecting their territory and trying to assess whether you are going to trespass or otherwise make trouble. If passing the yard they are defending, don't stare at them, don't do anything odd, but try to pass the yard as you would do if they weren't there and you knew where you are going.\n\nIf you need to go into territory a dog sees as theirs, the strategy is similar. First, if you think the dog may be dangerous, consider calling the owner by phone, or asking for help from a local. If you need to proceed on your own, and the dog is just big and alert on you, it might be viable to just walk forward in as normal a manner as you can, not staring at the dog. If it comes close you should acknowledge it, stop and let it check you out, still not staring and without sudden movements. You should still back off if it shows it doesn't like your approach.\n\nSuch dogs are rarely '''rabies|rabid''', but it is possible. Consider being vaccinated against rabies before travelling to such areas. See individual articles here for region-specific information and consult a physician (preferably one with expertise in travel medicine) for advice on vaccinations before you travel.\n]]\n\n==Encounter==\n* '''DO NOT RUN!''' – Although it may seem counter-intuitive when you suddenly see an angry, barking and snarling dog running towards you, the most important thing to do is not to turn and run. The dog's natural hunting instincts will kick in, and you are unlikely to outrun it.\n* Stay calm, don't make any sudden movements, and don't look the dog directly in the eye: dogs see this as a challenge and may react by becoming more aggressive.\n* Try to turn sideways on: this isn't necessarily a submissive gesture but is seen by the dog as less provocative. Also, if a dog does attack, this protects your throat and other sensitive areas.\n* Walking backwards away from the dog does also help – it is defending its territory, getting out of it seems reasonable.\n* Picking up a stone with the dog seeing it may helps as well: where locals do so, the dog will remember the last painful incidence of this type. If it does not help, throwing stones, dirt or sand at dogs that begin to approach you is often the last resort. For instance, in certain areas such as Iran, the locals' response on seeing dogs nearby is often to pick up a few stones to throw at them. The dogs will fairly often retreat if they just see you bending over for ammo.\n* Holding a stick, on the other hand, will often increase the aggressive behaviour of the dog. Likewise, they remember this as a painful experience, but they understand that they are in no danger to get hit unless they are close enough. This will make them come closer (than with stones) and remain aggressive instead of seeking shelter or hide somewhere where a stone cannot hit them.\n* If you are confronted by a dog when bicycling a good thing to do is to grab your bicycle water bottle and throw water at the dog. This causes the dog to back off. When dismounting away from the dog, your bicycle can be a useful barrier.\n* If you are confronted by a dog when motorcycling, approach it slowly to upset its timing, then speed up to leave it behind.\n\n==Protect==\n\nIf you're unlucky enough to get attacked, there are a number of things you can do to minimize the damage.\n* If you have an object (bag, coat, umbrella, etc.), you can hold out in front of you, offer this to the dog as it attacks. Alternatively — if you have time — wrap some padding around your arm and use this. If the dog bites on this, keep hold of it: if you let go, the dog will realize that it's not part of you and go for something else.\n* If lawful in your destination, try using a pepper spray and spray it directly into the face. Repeat spraying until the dog goes away.\n* If you get bitten, don't yank yourself away from the dog; its teeth are designed to stop things being ripped out of its mouth, Also, the animal's instincts will be to bite harder.\n* If you have been bitten, clean the wound thoroughly with soap and water and '''see a doctor as soon as possible'''; in destinations where rabies is endemic, you need rabies vaccination as a matter of urgency. The incubation period varies from days to many months, so get that vaccination even if you couldn't get it immediately! When symptoms develop, there is '''no cure''' any more.\n\n==See also==\n* Stay healthy\n* w:Dog bite prevention|Dog bite prevention (Wikipedia)\n\n\n\n"

Frequent ferry lines operate to the port of Sitia as well.\n\n===By plane===\nThe distance from  () near Heraklion to Agios Nikolaos is about . The journey time is 45 – 60&amp;nbsp;minutes by car or taxi.\n\nAlternatively the distance from  () near Sitia is about .\n\n==Get around==\n\n\n\n===By bus===\n[http://www.bus-service-crete-ktel.com/ Local bus service] with modern air-conditioned buses.\n\nElounda, Kritsa, Sitia, Heraklion (and from there, Knossos), Malia and Hersonnisos are easily accessed with a regular bus service which is very good value.\n\n===By scooter===\nScooters are readily available. Wearing crash helmets is ''compulsory.'' Do not ruin your holiday by receiving a large fine.\n\n===By hired car===\nYou will not normally need a 4 x 4 to negotiate the roads, most of which are paved. Some places and rental properties are less accessible. Beware of damage to the underside of the hire car on rough tracks.\n\n===By taxi===\nExcellent value. Invariably will be a large, clean and air-conditioned Mercedes. Most drivers speak basic English and have none of the bad habits of many Med taxi drivers (loud local music, smoking en route, etc.)\n\n===By quad===\nNot designed for use on the road, these cause traffic congestion and impatience, leading to many accidents and occasional deaths. Think very carefully before hiring one and using it on the roads.\n\n==See==\nRecommended are the boat trips which are fascinating and have amazing value (do not spend more than €10); they also usually include an ocean swim.\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Do==\n\nVisit Almyros beach, a long sandy beach with a cold water stream entering the sea at the southern end. Perfect for a cooling paddle if the heat gets too much. About a 20-minute walk from the town centre but worth every step. Alternatively, a taxi from the town centre costs about €8.\n\nIf it is windy, consider a pebble beach rather than a sand beach, of which there is no shortage.\n\n==Buy==\nLocally produced fruit and vegetables at the market on Wednesday morning. The tomatoes are superb.\n\nThyme honey. The bees here take the pollen from thyme and the subtle flavour is transferred to the honey.\n\n==Eat==\nThere are a good selection of restaurants and tavernas in the town, ranging from the small and friendly \"Grigoris\" to the superb \"Mediterraneo\" on the harbour.\n\nMeze restaurants worth visiting are \"Barko\" which provides a modern slant on traditional dishes and \"Chyssofillis\" on Kitroplatia. Just around the corner is \"9 Muses\", a modern restaurant/cafe bar which is popular with local residents. The \"Piato\" near Ammoudi beach is an excellent contemporary meze restaurant. Near the taxi rank by tourist information is \"Embassy\".\n\nFor more northern European tastes, \"Obelix\" is a Dutch operated restaurant near Ammoudi beach which serves large portions with a daily special.\n* \nPatriko towards Elounda, at Amoudi Beach. Lovely fresh fish and meats. Great Greek ambiance.\n\n==Drink==\nModern cafe bars on the right of the harbour include \"Molto\" and \"En Plo\".\n\n* \n\n\"Puerto\" is popular with the young locals and 25 March Street (25 Martiou) is busy at weekends with many of the local student population. Don't be misled by old tales about this street being the hub of the night life for tourists. It is entirely \"Greek\" and if you don't want to hear modern Greek music you will be in the wrong place.\n\nThe bars that have survived the change in tourist tastes over the last few years include \"Aquarius\", \"Sorrento\" and \"Alexandros\". The first two are \"British\" style tourist bars and the latter is a rooftop garden bar which has a small dance floor.\n\nAlso '''Toedeledokie Bar-Cafe''' situated in between Coral and Hermes Hotel with candle light and good music.\n\nThe small but friendly \"Sky Bar\" near to the Marina shows televised sport.\n\n* \n\n==Sleep==\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Go next==\n\n\n\n\n\n"

                    "text": "\nImage:Agonda.JPG|thumbnail|350px|right|Agonda beach\n'''Agonda''' is a beach area in the southernmost Canacona taluka of the Indian state of Goa.\n\n==Understand==\n\nAgonda is a great spot for sunbathing, relaxing and swimming, with still relatively few tourists. This is a nice long pristine stretch of beach. Though the waters here might not be the most ideal place for swimming (you have better beaches with calm waters in Goa), Agonda is definitely a place for those who want to quit on a Monday morning. Most mobile connections do not work here (only Vodafone does), so that is an added bonus for those looking forward to a quiet and relaxed holiday. Or, if you do need to party sometimes, Palolem is just 15 minutes by motorbike (10&amp;nbsp;km) away - but Agonda is generally cheaper, quieter, hassle-free and has much less \"touristic\" feel.\n\nAgonda Beach has one long road parallel to the beach line, most rooms and bungalows for rent are either between them or on the opposite side of the road. In the centre of the beach, there is Agonda Church and a local school/college (funnily enough, called Agonda University) to the right of it. Another road goes up from the church, crosses the river shortly after and goes through the village to the junction with a main road from Chaudi and Palolem, which are both to the right. To the left, this bigger road crosses the village until the beach road joins it near the river mouth and northern end of the beach, then continues on in the direction of Cabo da Rama.\n\n==Get in==\nDabolim airport is about a 90-minute drive away. Agonda by road is 15 minutes from the more famous, busy Palolem beach.\n\n===By train===\nAgonda is only a few kilometres from Canacona station, although main train services stop at Margao station, about an hour’s drive away.\n\n===By bus===\nRegular buses depart from the Canacona bus station for Agonda (about 20 minutes). Buses from Chaudi and Margao are available a few times a day.\n\nFrom Canacona station, it's about 1&amp;nbsp;km to the Canacona bus stand, where you can bus the 9&amp;nbsp;km to Agonda. The bus stand is a large building with a white, curved roof. It is visible from the balcony of the Canacona railway station. To get there, walk up the road away from the train station until you reach the main road. Turn right (there will be a railway bridge to your left), and walk for 300 m, the building will be on your left. Buses start at 7:35AM and run about every hour until 6PM-ish. As with any Indian bus stand, you'll have to ask the people around, although the buses heading in that direction do usually stop near the sign at the bus station that says Agonda.\n\nAgonda buses leave to go back every 30 min from the other side of the road to where you get dropped off. The last bus to Canacona leaves Agonda at 6:30PM. If you miss it, the locals can be persuaded to give you a motorbike ride back to the station for about ₹100.\n\nThe bus will drop you off at the northern end of the beach, on a junction near the church.\n\nThere are a few more buses on the main road, but this means 10-15 minutes walk from the beach centre. The price to Chaudi is ₹7 or ₹8. To Canacona, about ₹25.\n\n===By taxi===\nTaxis and auto rickshaws are a more comfortable  and quicker alternative to the public bus.\n\nAsk any rickshaw driver or taxi driver and they will take you there from Palolem, Patnem or Chaudi.\n\n==Get around==\n\nOne or two autos usually stand near the church during the daytime. As always in India, bargain (the normal price to Chaudi or Palolem should be around ₹50, but many tourists end up paying ₹100 and more).\n\nMotorbikes and scooters are offered for rent, both by house owners and by the auto guys near the church. A nearly-new Honda Activa or similar should cost ₹150-200 a day. (₹200 is a usual starting price, but during the peak period bargaining could be difficult), less if rented for more than a week or two.\n\n==See==\n\nAgonda's beach is very simple and natural. There are some sunbeds but when the tourist police or Canacona local government officials appear, any beach shades, sunbeds, chairs, etc. which are outside the confines of the shacks disappear pronto and the beach looks even more gorgeous and makes you realise why you went there and not to some built up resort.\n\nAgonda beach is famous as a Ridley turtle nesting site. These animals are endangered. Please keep the noise level and the lights down at night at the beach to give them a chance to nest. The Panchayat ( village administration) is very invested in not allowing Agonda to become another overcrowded Palolem. Anything you can do to minimize waste, safe water or electricity will be much appreciated since the village is struggling to avoid environmental degradation and preserve its beauty for the next generation. It is very quiet place, not suitable for the party crowd.\n*\n\n==Do==\n\nA typical sun and sand holiday.\n\n* Local fishermen take you on dolphin rides. Bargain hard and a boat can take up to  people, costing ₹800.\n* Hike on the hillocks.\n* Ride through the countryside on the way to Cabo de Rama, Cola Beach with its beautiful river which is always warm.\n* A meeting place for spiritually interested people. Here is Samdarshi's mediation Ashram in wintertime (Eden-Garden close to the north end) with Satsangs, and free Osho mediation techniques, dancing evenings.\n* '''Cola Beach''' (or Khola Beach) is a remote, unspoilt beach for those seeking complete peace and relaxation, 10 km north from Agonda. Go north past Agonda, up and down hills, through villages, past the big temple on your left to the place where the bus stops. About 25 m after your exit is the only road sign for Cola Beach. Your exit is a sand and stone road going through the dried out landscape, just follow the main track for a few km’s and you’ll find yourself looking down on Cola Beach. It’s not all that easy to find this place, but it will be worth your effort. You park your bike or scooter where the road ends, and then there’s a 3-minute walk, down to the beach. Cola beach looks beautiful through the trees from the top of the path. The beach is actually three small bays, separated by large rocks. The middle beach covers a lagoon that stretches back into the jungle. When you walk down the stairs you’ll walk straight into the ‘Blue Lagoon’, the only option for eating and drinking on Cola Beach.\n\n===Yoga===\n* There are a few yoga schools and yoga teacher training centers in Agonda.\n\n==Buy==\nThere are stores stocking basic supplies in Agonda, as well as internet, phone and currency conversion services. HDFC Bank ATM is near the church. More shops, a Saturday market and several ATMs are a 20-minute drive away in the local town, Chaudi.\n\n*\n\n==Eat==\n\nThere are no renowned eateries like the big beaches but you can order for most international cuisines. Not all places where you stay will have a restaurant. Nevertheless there are enough to survive upon. Dersey's on the southern end of Agonda beach is one of the restaurants open even during the low season, serving both Indian and local food. There's another (probably year-round) restaurant on the beach road closer to the northern end, but it seems to be overpriced with rates compared or even more than those on Palolem beach. During the high season, more places are opened, but still not too many.\n\nIf you do not afraid local food (and there's nothing dangerous in it, actually) and/or want to save money, Niki bar on the road to Chaudi (just where the road to Agonda Beach branches from it to the right) serves good fish thalis for a reasonable ₹30 in what seems to be a local eatery and an afternoon (as he closes his place around 5PM) drinking point for a few locals. Foreigners are seen there surprisingly often for such a \"local\" place.\n\nSome local shops also do have a few tables and prepare basic food (omelettes, fish &amp; veg thalis, tea, juice, etc.) during the high season, but their price tag is usually more \"touristic\" (less than in restaurants, however, that is ₹50-60 for a thali). One of them can be found 50 m from the church, at the end of the first building with small shops on the left side.\n\n*\n*\n\n==Drink==\nAgonda is a relatively quiet village, and there are much fewer opportunities for a fun evening out there than in Palolem. But, as it is Goa, buying drinks is not a problem, at least before 9-10PM. Restaurants offer beer at least; also, there is a wine shop around 100-150 m to the right from Agonda church and another one in Dersey's. Just opposite the church on the street leading away from the sea, there is a tiny and cheap local bar (small beer ₹30, big ₹60, they have Old Monk also) which is open till the evening. Don't expect many people there, however; you can easily be the only customer even in the evening.\n\n==Sleep==\n\nOnly basic accommodation options are available for stay in Agonda. Outside the main season which is from November to February, you have to arrange for a stay in a Goan family house. Off-season prices there, however, can be really low - for example, in October (when, while it's still humid a bit, most days are sunny) you can rent a room in a nice Portuguese-style villa from around ₹250 (peak high-season prices for the same could be around ₹600, or less in the wooden bungalows mostly built between the main street and the beach). While locals are mostly genuinely friendly and there's much less hassle from them than, say, in Palolem, some of them won't think twice before asking three or more times the normal price, especially if they see the person isn't used to the local prices. So, if you're asked much more than expected, bargain or better try another place.\n\nAdvance booking, however, is neither really needed (maybe except for a few peak days around New Year) nor saves any money (in fact, often you pay more).\n\n*\n* \n* '''[https://www.madhuhutsagonda.com/ Madhu Huts Agonda]''' Madhu Huts Agonda is more than just a stay—it's a journey into the heart of Agonda, Goa. India Best '''[https://www.madhuhutsagonda.com/about.php Ocean View Huts in Agonda]'''\n* \n*\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Stay safe==\nAgonda is a fairly safe place. While you should retain your common sense, lock the door and windows when going out, and not to leave your valuables unattended, chances to have any problems in Agonda are very slim. Even sellers offering useless \"souvenirs\" on the beach are much less annoying and less frequent here than in Palolem or northern beaches.\n\n==Go next==\n\nLocal bus station is in Chaudi. It is useful mainly for going to the south (Karwar, Ankola, Gokarna, Mangalore), east (Hampi via Ankola), or some more remote locations like Bangalore. If you plan to visit North Goa or going somewhere further north - you should go straight to Margao, as from Chaudi it will be your first major stop anyway.\n\nTrain station in Chaudi (Canacona) has only a few trains a day stopping on it. Much more trains are leaving or stopping on Margao (Madgaon) station. Check [http://www.irctc.co.in IRCTC] web site for details and online ticket bookings.\n\nThe nearest (international) airport is at Dabolim, 65 km away. To get there by bus, you'll need to first to Margao, then to Vasco Da Gama or to the airport directly. There is possibly direct bus from Karwar to Vasco/airport also, which stops at Canacona - check in advance whether it's available.\n\nTaxis are advertised in Agonda by some establishments (shops, etc.) on the beach road - mostly for longer trips such as to airport or Margao.\n\n\n\n"

After the Reconquista, the town belonged to the crown of Castile for a few years, before being incorporated into the Kingdom of Valencia in the late 13th century. Agost gained municipal autonomy at the end of the 17th century.\n\nDue to the rich clay deposits located just outside the city, the town developed into a centre of pottery. Although many of the old workshops have now closed, eleven potteries still remain in town, six of them still producing traditional wares.\n\nBecause of its distance from the coast, the town has not been inundated by mass tourism and has retained its local identity. Today its primary economic activity is ceramics production and agriculture.\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By bus===\nFrom Alicante, [http://agostense.es/horarios/?from=Alicante&amp;to=Agost&amp;period=-1 '''Autocares Agostense'''] () runs three buses daily, departing at 09:00, 13:58 and 20:30, with the journey taking just half an hour.\n\n==See==\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Do==\n\n==Buy==\n* \n\n==Eat==\n\n==Drink==\n\n==Sleep==\n* \n\n==Connect==\n\n==Go next==\n\n\n\n\n"

                    "text": "\n'''Agra''' (Hindi: आगरा ''Āgrā'') is the city of the Taj Mahal, in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, some 200&amp;nbsp;km from Delhi.\n\nAgra has three UNESCO World Heritage List|UNESCO World Heritage sites, the '''Taj Mahal''' and the '''Agra Fort''' in the city and '''Fatehpur Sikri''' 40 km away. There are also many other buildings and tombs from Agra's days of glory as the capital of the Mughal Empire.\n\nBesides these three sites, the city has little else to recommend it. Pollution, especially smog and litter, is rampant and visitors are pestered by swarms of touts and hawkers at every monument, besides the inner Taj Mahal which, once you are in, is free of scams and touts. The sites are some of the wonders of the world and no trip to India is complete without at least one visit to the Taj. For the vast majority of visitors, a single day in Agra is more than enough.\n\n==Understand==\n\nWhile the heyday of Agra (ahg-rah) was as the capital of the Mughal Empire between 1526 and 1658, the city was founded much earlier. The earliest reference to Agra is in the ancient epic, the Mahabharata, while Ptolemy was the first person to call it by its modern name. The recorded history of Agra begins around the 11th century, and over the next 500 years, the city changed hands between various kings, both Hindu and Muslim.\n\nIn 1506, Sultan Sikandar Lodi, the ruler of the Delhi Sultanate, moved his capital from Delhi to Agra. His son Ibrahim Lodi was the last ruler of the Lodi dynasty, as he was defeated in 1526 by Babur, the first Mughal ruler, in the battle of Panipat. Agra fell too, and became the capital of the Mughals, whose rule over Agra was uninterrupted except for a brief period between 1540 and 1556. In 1540, Sher Shah Shuri overthrew Humayun became the ruler of much of North India, including Agra. After Sher Shah Suri's death his descendants proved unequal to the task of ruling the kingdom, and Hemu, a Hindu general of Suri became the effective ruler who would later crown himself King Hemachandra Vikramaditya just as the kingdom was facing an assault from the reinvigorated Mughals. In 1556, Hemu would be defeated and killed in the second battle of Panipat, and the Mughals regained Agra.\n\nMughals were great builders. Babur built the '''Aram Bagh''' (garden of relaxation) modelled after the garden of paradise, where he was eventually buried after his death. His grandson Akbar refurbished the '''Agra fort''' and built the '''Fatehpur Sikri''', an entire city just on the outskirts of Agra. He also renamed Agra after himself, and the city was known as '''Akbarabad''' while it was in Mughal hands. Akbar's grandson Shah Jahan would give Agra its most famous monument, the '''Taj Mahal''', which is the mausoleum of his beloved wife, '''Mumtaz Mahal'''. The Taj is constructed in white marble. It took 20 years to construct, and is now universally known as a monument to love. Legend has it that Shah Jahan wanted a replica of the Taj constructed in black marble that would be his final resting place. There is no support for this theory, but even if it were true, it would have been unlikely to be undertaken. His son Aurangzeb was austere and pious, and had no time or inclination for the ostentation of his forefathers, preferring to spend his money on wars in South India. In any case, even during Shah Jahan's reign, which was the period when the Mughal empire was at its height, the construction of the Taj put a strain on the resources of the empire and caused a mini-famine around Agra. Shah Jahan was eventually buried in the white Taj, next to his beloved Begum.\n\nShah Jahan, in addition to giving Agra its greatest claim to fame, was also responsible for beginning its decline, as he decided to shift his capital to Shahjahanabad, which is now known as Old Delhi, in 1658. Though Aurangzeb ordered a move back, this too was short lived, as he moved his headquarters down south to Aurangabad (present-day Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar) to be focus on his wars. Agra declined, and so did the Mughal Empire. The city was eventually captured by the Marathas, who renamed Agra. In 1803, it came under the British, who situated the Agra Presidency there, and when India gained independence, the city was incorporated into the state of Uttar Pradesh, and did not gain even the limited honour of being the state's capital, that distinction going to Lucknow, further east. It is now a tourist town, known for the Taj and a couple of other monuments.\n\nA novel based on the remarkable story behind the Taj Mahal's is ''Beneath a Marble Sky'' by John Shors. It is an international bestseller, and is being made into a film by Hollywood. Another historical novel is ''The Taj'' by Colin De Silva.\n\n===Local information ===\n* [http://agra.nic.in Agra District government] website\n\n==Get in==\nAgra is 200&amp;nbsp;km southeast from Delhi and is one of the points of the tourist's Golden Triangle of Agra-Delhi-Jaipur. Agra is also very well connected via rail and road with other nearby cities and tourist destinations and thus suitable for a day trip from Delhi or as a part of a larger itinerary.\n\n===By plane===\n*  | url= | email=\n| address= | lat=27.1575 | long=77.960833 | directions=\n| phone= | tollfree=\n| hours= | price=\n| wikipedia=Agra Airport | wikidata=Q1849321\n| content=Indigo flies direct flights to this airport from Mumbai, Bengaluru, Lucknow and Bhopal.\n}}\n\n===By train===\nAgra is on the main railway line between the Delhi–Mumbai and Delhi–Chennai routes, and many trains connect Agra with these cities every day. Some east-bound trains from Delhi also travel via Agra, so direct connections to points in Eastern India (including Kolkata) are also available. There are close to 20 trains to Delhi every day, and at least three or four to Mumbai and to Chennai. Agra and Delhi are notorious for their thick winter fog which reduces visibility to almost zero. In late December and early January (the fog season), because of the reduced visibility, all trains slow down and travel time goes up. The Bhopal Shatabdi, for example, may arrive in Agra well after 10AM, and might return to Delhi well after midnight. From a safety point of view, it is always preferable to travel by train during the winter.\n\nAt Agra station, you can hire \"UP Tourism\" conducted tours on air-conditioned luxury coaches. Also, organized tours are available from Delhi. ''If you travel during the high season, you must book your tickets a few days to a few weeks in advance if you wish to make it a day trip'', i.e. travelling early in the morning and coming back at a reasonable time at night.\n\nTrain tickets can be booked online through the Indian Railways website paying by debit or credit cards, although those issued by foreign banks are often declined. For more information how to book tickets online, visit the article Rail travel in India.\n\n====Stations====\nThere are several railway stations stations in Agra. However, tourists only need to concern about Agra Cantonment and Agra Fort as almost all mainline trains calls here.\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n====Lines====\n* '''Delhi to Agra''' — Close to 20 trains connect Delhi and Agra each day with journey times varying from 2-5 hr. The best options include the ''Rani Kamalapati Vande Bharat Express'' (fastest), ''Rani Kamalapati Shatabdi Express'' (departs New Delhi at 6:15AM arriving Agra Cantt at 8:12AM; departs Agra Cantt at 8:30PM arriving New Delhi at 10:30PM, daily except Friday; meal and water included in air-con carriage) and the ''Taj Express'' (departs Hazrat Nizamuddin at 7:15AM arriving Agra Cantt at 10:07AM; departs Agra Cantt at 6:55PM arriving Hazrat Nizamuddin at 10PM, daily).\n* '''Agra to Jaipur''' - The journey to Jaipur (station code: JP) takes around 4 hr by train no. 2988 which leaves Agra Fort at 6:25PM and reaches Jaipur at around 10:20PM.\nAlso train number 2965 from Agra Cantonment to Jaipur at 5:40PM. The train arrives at 10:15PM. ₹300 air-con carriage.\n\n* The '''Luxury train''' — ''Palace on Wheels'' stops at Agra on its 8-day round trip of tourist destinations in Rajasthan and Agra.\n\n===By bus===\nThere are several buses to Agra originating from Jaipur, Delhi, Ajmer, Lucknow etc.\n\n====From Delhi====\nThe highway between Delhi and Agra has a toll, so most buses do not take it. Rather, they take the local roads, which makes the trip significantly longer than the express trains (4-5 hr). It is possible to make it by bus and minibus to Agra by the smaller roads, however you must ask around where the buses to Agra depart from, preferably from a trusted local or the staff at your hotel or hostel. Indian bus stations are, most of the time either large pavement areas situated under flyovers, very crowded and without no further indications of which bus goes where or stands of private bus companies, which will offer a more comfortable trip at a higher price. This option is for the ones who feel adventurous, as your journey can be halted by a sudden breakdown of the bus or a road closure due to a local protest or other form of gathering. Note that this is by far the cheapest way to get to Agra, as it should not cost more than ₹60 the normal \"bus\" and ₹200 for a more coach-type bus.\n\n====From Agra====\nThere are three interstate bus stands:\n* '''Idgah Bus Stand''' is the primary bus stand for travelling towards Rajasthan/Madhya Pradesh, in the heart of the city, 8&amp;nbsp;km from the Taj.\n* '''ISBT''' at Transport Nagar, 12&amp;nbsp;km from the Taj, is an inter state bus terminal. Most of the buses pass through here, except for buses originating from Idgah Bus Stand and going towards Rajasthan.\n\nIf you wish to travel with these buses which are government-run, '''you must insist to your rickshaw driver that he gets you there'''. If you only ask for the buses to Delhi, he will probably take you to a private bus company, from which he gets a cut. It will be slightly more expensive for you and these buses tend to stop at random places and drop you at random places as well, as these buses are not direct.\n\n===By taxi===\nYou can either book a taxi from hotel or directly book one outside the railway station. There is usually a government authorised taxi stand, however it may be hard to find and the locals present at the station (looking for gullible tourists) will not help you find it. ₹1500/day for 8&amp;nbsp;hours. It maybe more costly to book through hotel as hotels do have their in the fares. It is better to negotiate with the driver directly or book trough some online car rental portal.\n\nCars are not allowed near the Taj Complex, but the rest of Agra is easily discovered by car.\n\n===By car===\n* '''From Delhi''': Yamuna Expressway, connects the 210 km distance from Delhi to Agra. The drive is typically 3.5 hours. The expressway runs from the city of Greater Noida to Agra. The highway has a toll.\nNH2 Highway: The primary access to the highway is along Mathura Road in Delhi but, if coming from South Delhi or Delhi Airport, it is easier to take Aurobindo Marg (Mehrauli Road) and then work up to NH2 via Tughlakabad. While the highway is divided, it is important to keep an eye out for trucks, cars, and bullock carts heading the wrong way. It is possible to hire a car with a driver (a big car for five persons from/to the Delhi airport costs ₹3500). Moreover, both online and offline options are available for tourists.  But beware, if you need to get from Agra to the airport in order to catch a flight, ensure you have plenty of time for the trip, as traffic conditions may increase the drive time significantly. Also, it is wise to know your driver. There are situations when he may take over five hours to cover the distance, and you cannot force him to drive any faster than an autorickshaw (tuk-tuk).\n\n* '''From Jaipur''': National Highway 11, a four-lane divided highway, connects Agra with Jaipur via the bird sanctuary town of Bharatpur &amp; Fatehpur Sikri. The distance of around 255&amp;nbsp;km can be covered in around 4 hours.\n* '''From Gwalior''': A distance of around 120&amp;nbsp;km, takes around 1.5&amp;nbsp;hours on the National highway 3 (Agra- Mumbai Highway).\n* '''From Lucknow / Kanpur''': NH2, the divided modern highway, continues on to Kanpur (285&amp;nbsp;km, 5&amp;nbsp;hours) and from there to points East ending in Kolkata. From Kanpur, NH25 heads for the city of Lucknow (90&amp;nbsp;km, 2&amp;nbsp;hours).\n* '''From Lucknow'''] Agra-Lucknow Expressway, the longest expressway in India, connects the 302 km distance from the state capital, Lucknow to Agra. The drive is very smooth and takes 3 hours. It is a tolled highway.\n* '''From Greater Noida ''': Perhaps the best route as it connects to Agra directly by the Yamuna Expressway, 165&amp;nbsp;km, which can be completed in 1.5–2&amp;nbsp;hours because it has less traffic. The road is very smooth.\n\n==Get around==\n\n\n\n\n===By metro===\nThe first section of the Agra Metro is now open, conveniently connecting the eastern gate of the Taj Mahal with Agra Fort.  Tickets are ₹30 and trains run from 6 am till 10 pm.\n\n===By bus or auto===\nTongas, electric buses and electric tempos are readily available, and the best way to get to the Taj, where no cars are allowed. Auto-rickshaws and cycle rickshaws are available every where, remember to agree on fares clearly in advance. Foreigners should bargain everywhere and bargain hard. Generally things are available at 40% of the initially quoted fares. Normally Charges for e-rickshaws are ₹150-200 per e-rickshaws which can accommodate up to 4 people. Tempos have been replaced by auto-rickshaws, which mainly run on CNG (Compressed Natural Gas).\n\nUP State Road Transport Corporation operates some non-air conditioned and air-conditioned buses but those run only on specific routes. The best way to experience the city is to take a walk on the Mall Road (Sadar). The street is full of handicraft and leather goods shops. You will also find plenty of food items quite unique to the city.\n\nAs polluting vehicles are banned around Taj Mahal, one needs to use Tonga or electric auto while travelling in the range of Taj Mahal. Camels are also available. As a guide, an auto rickshaw from Agra Cantonment station to the Taj is about ₹200 (at least in off season); and a cycle rickshaw from the Taj to Agra Fort is ₹40. You can also walk between the Taj and Agra Fort, in about 30 minutes.\n\n==See==\n\nAgra's top two sights by far are the incomparable Taj Mahal and Agra Fort.\n\n===Taj Mahal===\n\n\n\n*\n\nThe Taj Mahal has a life of its own that leaps out of marble once you understand that it is a monument of love. The Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore called it ''a teardrop on the cheek of eternity'', while the English poet, Sir Edwin Arnold, said it was ''Not a piece of architecture, as other buildings are, but the proud passions of an emperor's love wrought in living stones.''\n\nAlthough it is one of the most photographed edifices in the world and instantly recognisable, actually seeing it in person is awe-inspiring. Not everything is in the photos. The grounds of the complex include several other beautiful buildings, reflecting pools, and extensive ornamental gardens with flowering trees and bushes, and a small gift shop. The Taj framed by trees and reflected in a pool is amazing. Close up, large parts of the building are covered with inlaid stonework.\n\nThere is an apocryphal tale that Shah Jahan planned to build an exact copy out of black marble on the opposite side of the Yamuna river. His plans were foiled by his son, Aurangzeb, who murdered three of his elder brothers and then overthrew and imprisoned his father to acquire the throne. Shah Jahan is now buried alongside his wife in the Taj Mahal.\n\nBecause the Taj is white, your camera may underexpose your photos. Overexposure by 1 or 2 stops is recommended.\n\nThe Taj is located in the middle of the city. Expect a queue to get into the grounds. There are three gates: The western gate is the main gate where most tourists enter. A large number of people visit on weekends and public holidays and entry through the western gate may take hours. The southern and eastern gates are much less busy and should be tried on such days.\n\nOnce inside, expect long queues to enter the Mausoleum. There are two lines depending on the type of ticket that you've purchased. At the base of the monument, turn to your right for general (Indian) entry and turn to your left for high-value (foreigner) tickets. The general line can wrap around the building several times by the afternoon, whereas the foreigner line is typically empty. Helpful guards can direct you if you get lost.\n\nMosquito repellent is advisable in the warmer months.\n\n====Opening times====\nOpen daily (except Fridays) from sunrise to sunset (6-7AM until 6-7:30PM, depending on time of year).\n\nGet there as early as possible to beat the crowds, and plan to visit the Taj at least two different times during the day (dusk and dawn are best) in order to experience the full effect of changing sunlight on the amazing building. Note that entry to the monument closes 30 minutes before sunset. \n\n====Night view====\nThere are night viewing of Taj Mahal sessions on the nights of a full moon and the two days before and after (so five days in total). Exceptions are Fridays, the Muslim sabbath, and the month of Ramadan. Tickets cost ₹510 for Indians and ₹750 for non-Indians; tickets can only be purchased online at Archeological Survey of India website and are usually sold out very quickly. Opening times: 9PM-midnight; attendance is split into 30-minutes slots, 50 visitors group for each slot. A visitor must arrive 30 min prior to viewing hours for a security check at the Taj Mahal ticket kiosk at the East Gate. However, the night view is likely not worth spending the money as the visitors are kept far from the Taj Mahal (nearly 200 m away) and there is not sufficient light for viewing or photography.\n\n====Tickets====\nEntry to the Taj Mahal costs ₹50 for Indians and ₹1100 for foreigners/NRI(Non-resident Indians). To enter inside the mausoleum (the main structure of the Taj Mahal), you must pay an additional ₹200 (March 2024).\n\nThe Taj Mahal ticket fee for foreigners includes a small bottle of water, and disposable shoe covers for entering the mausoleum. You may also enter the mausoleum barefoot, so consider refusing the disposable shoes covers and going in barefoot. There are shoe racks to keep your shoes just outside the mausoleum.\n\nYou can buy tickets from 3 entrances: the South, East and West gates. The West gate (opens 6am) is typically the busiest (you could be queueing for hours) but closest to the city. The south gate is less busy but opens later at 8am. The East gate (opens 6am) is the furthest from the city but also generally the least busy.\n\n=====Online ticketing=====\n\nThe Indian government also provides online ticketing for the Taj Mahal.\n\n====Tour guides and audio guides====\n\nOfficial guides are available for Agra for ₹1200 for a half day (including Taj Mahal &amp; Agra Fort). Ask at your agent for details. Any guide that charges less than that is probably an unlicensed tour. Most unlicensed touts have fake IDs and focus more on taking you shopping rather than on presenting accurate information. You can book a local Govt. approved guide by logging www.tajtourguide.com or online search.\n\nYou can purchase a self-guided audio tour (allows two to a device) from near the ticketing booths. Cost is ₹100 in English and foreign languages and ₹60 for Indian languages.\n\nYou can also consider downloading a free audio guide such as the CaptivaTour Travel Audio Guide, which has a reasonable free 45-minute audio guide for the Taj Mahal.\n\n====Notes====\n*Government-issued photo ID, such as your passport, is sometimes requested to be shown to the security guards at the entrance.\n*Bringing a keyboard from a tablet is forbidden. Moreover, the cloakroom at Taj Mahal may refuse to take the keyboard without a bag or a backpack, and also refuse to take the backpack with a tablet. \n*Walking inside the Taj Mahal mausoleum in the shoe covers provided might be quite dangerous, as the marble floors are very slippery. \n*Tobacco, alcohol, food, chewing gum, headphones, knives and tripods are prohibited inside the Taj Mahal complex.\n*Eating and smoking is prohibited inside the Taj Mahal complex.\n*Lockers are available at the gates to keep your belongings (of course, at your own risk). Memorise the number on your luggage ticket before you return it to the guard, who, incredibly, may proceed to tear it into tiny pieces, throw it away and then stare blankly at you as the other guard asks for your ticket.\n*Avoid carrying big bags and books as this will mean the guards will take longer to search through them. The guard may require you to check even medium-sized backpacks.\n*Photography is prohibited inside the main mausoleum.\n*Mobile phones are allowed but must to be kept switched off. Mobile phones are banned for the night viewing of the Taj Mahal.\n*Video cameras are allowed up to the red sandstone platform at the main entrance gate of the Taj Mahal complex.\n*Only hand-held cameras and binoculars are allowed for night viewing of the Taj Mahal.\n*Avoid touching and scratching the walls and surfaces of the monument as these are old heritage sites that need special care.\n*Wheelchairs for disabled persons and first aid boxes are available at ASI office inside the Taj Mahal complex for a ₹1,000 refundable deposit.\n*The Taj Mahal is a religious site. It is best to dress conservatively when visiting the Taj Mahal complex, not only because the Taj Mahal itself is a mausoleum, but also because there are mosques inside the Taj Mahal complex.\n\n===Agra Fort===\n\n\n\n* \n\nEmperor Akbar, king at 14, began consolidating his empire and, as an assertion of his power built the fort in Agra between 1565 and 1571, at the same time as Humayun's Tomb in Delhi. Emperor Shah Jahan added to the fort and ended up a prisoner in it. The fort has a beautiful view of his masterpiece, the Taj Mahal, on a clear day.\n\nYou can get to the fort by Rickshaw from Taj Mahal for around ₹45-50. Entry to the fort is ₹600 plus a levy of ₹50 if you have not already paid for the Taj Mahal.\n\nThere are ''left luggage services'' at Agra Fort where you can store your bags at no cost. A fine of ₹5,000 applies if you lose your luggage ticket. Eating is not allowed.\n\nThere are also audio guides available at Agra Fort which you can rent for a cost of ₹100 in English and other foreign languages (German, French, Spanish) or ₹60 in Indian languages such as Hindi or Bengali.\n\n===Gardens===\n* \n* \n* \n\n===Temples===\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* '''Sheesh Mahal''', within the Agra Fort, is a stunning palace adorned with intricate mirror work and glass mosaics. Built by Emperor Shah Jahan, it served as a royal dressing room and exemplifies the exquisite craftsmanship of the Mughal era.\n\n===Churches and cemeteries===\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Other sights===\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Do==\n*'''City Walks''': Other than the monuments visits, one can also stroll in the local markets in old city area. Its a nice experience to have a walk in one of the oldest parts of the city.\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Buy==\n\nAgra has many shops selling stone products, from jewellery to small boxes and plaques with inlay work resembling that on the Taj. The best of these are wonderful, and even the run-of-the-mill ones are rather pretty. Agra is also famous for its leather goods. Consider spending time in Sadar Bazaar for some shopping and cheap food. These markets have gemstones, both precious and semi-precious, cut and polished but unset, and finished jewellery. You can also find chic boutiques, classy leather goods, culturally-designed clothing, and marble markets.\n\nBeware of being overcharged. Do not let ''anyone'' lead you to a shop, lest the price go up to cover their commission, typically 50%. Be very wary of the promises these people make. Bargain hard. Be prepared to walk away, you can nearly always get the same items in another shop or order items you liked during your visit over the Internet after you return. Expect to encounter petty and greedy shopowners who will resort to every lie in the book to make a sale (with initial markups of 1,000-10,000%).\n\nThere are many local markets: Sadar Bazar. a sophisticated market, Raja ki Mandi market, Sanjay Place for all the offices, Shah Market for electronics. All of these markets are situated along the M G Road. Hospital Road Market and Subhash Bazar for clothes situated near Agra Fort railway station. Rawatpara market is for spices. Besides these there are many branded shops along the M G Road.\n\nMany wholesale marble products are available at Gokul Pura Market near Raja Mandi on M. G. Road which can be easily reached by auto rickshaw, the price of most items are nearly 25% in the retail market.\n\nBe careful when buying jewels: lots of stones are fake and the price is comparatively high.\n\n==Eat==\nAgra specialities are ''petha'', a type of very sweet candy, and ''Dal Moth'', a spicy lentil mix. Both are also popular souvenirs.\n\n* '''Chaat''' - Agra is a heaven for any Chaat lover. Chaat can be of various types but there is one thing common among them all is that they are spicy and you will find crowd outside virtually every chaat stall, especially popular places like Double Phatak (near Sikandra) for Mangores. You'll find quality Bhallas and Panipuri at Sadar and Belangunj. Samosa and Kachori are found at every sweet shop that flood the city. Some typical chaat items are Aloo Tikki (made by roasting mess made out of boiled potatoes), paneer tikka (cubes of cottage cheese baked in a tandoor with spices), pani puri or golguppa (small round hollow shells filled with a potato-based filling and a spicy sweet blend of sauces), mangores, Samosaes, Chachori, etc. If you want to savour the typical Agra breakfast have a bite of one of those spicy ''Berahi'' and round it off with sweet ''Jalebies''.\n* '''Sweets''' - There are quite a few good sweets shops. The best for the famous petha of Agra are at Hari Parwat, a short distance from Agra Fort. Amongst the well-known shops are Panchi's, Bhimsain BaidyaNath and The Pracheen Petha store. There are many types of petha available but, for the authentic experience, try either the plain one (ivory white) or Angoori flavoured (rectangular and yellow pieces soaked in sugar syrup). Other shops in Agra include: Bikanervala, Deviram, Munnalal Petha, Gopaldas, and Ajanta Sweets, Kamla Nagar. You can round off your meal with a Joda (pair) of Pan unique to the city.\n* There is also an abundance of Korean food.\n* There are several restaurants in the Taj Ganj area, catering for the many tourists staying around the Taj Mahal.\n\n===Budget===\n\n====Around the Taj Mahal====\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n====Around the Agra Fort train station====\n\n* \n\n===Mid-range===\n\n* \n* \n\n===Splurge===\n\n==Drink==\n\nA bottle of Indian beer costs around ₹70-100 in a hotel, but there is virtually no nightlife in Agra outside of cultural shows at some of the larger hotels and restaurants.

Cross check all hotel, restaurant and lounge bills for errors.\n* Never pay anyone for anything upfront, including taxi drivers.\n* Beware of pickpockets.\n* If you decide to purchase anything, beware that most items are cheap replicas of original items and not likely to last long. The toys are really poorly put together so do not buy them!\n* During the winter season, the weather of Agra is unpredictable and temperature may go as low as freezing; be well prepared.\n* Some unscrupulous dealers of carpets use the classic 'bait and switch'. If you buy something, insist on carrying it yourself else what arrives in the post might not be what you bargained for. A carpet shop named 'Kanu carpets' is particularly infamous for this. It is prudent to steer clear of shady looking establishments.\n\n==Connect==\n\n[http://www.bsnl.in BSNL], [http://airtel.in AirTel], [http://www.vodafone.in Vodafone] and [http://www.ideacellular.com/ Idea] provide GSM (triband) and [http://www.rcom.co.in Reliance] and [http://www.tataindicom.com/ Tata] provide CDMA services.\n\n===Internet===\nThere are several Internet cafés for sending email or uploading digital photos.\n* '''[http://www.iway.com/ Sify Iway]''' also offers broadband connectivity at different locations spread all over the city.\n\nMany cheap cafés, such as the Taj Café, offer free Wi-Fi.\n\n==Go next==\n\n\n\n* '''Bharatpur''' is about 56&amp;nbsp;km from Agra and houses the famous bird sanctuary in which you can see thousands of rare birds including '''Siberian Crane'''. The Lohagarh Fort remained invincible despite several attacks by the British. Just 32&amp;nbsp;km from Bharatpur is the Deeg Palace. This strong and massive fort was the summer resort of the rulers of Bharatpur and has many palaces and gardens.\n* '''Fatehpur Sikri''' ghost city is a UNESCO world heritage site about 40 km from Agra. Built in the 16th century by the Emperor Akbar, the \"City of Victory\" was the capital of the Mughal Empire for a brief decade and was abandoned in 1586 due to inadequate local water supplies and proximity to the Rajputana areas in the North-West, which were increasingly in turmoil. It includes one of the largest mosques in India, the Jama Masjid. Full of well preserved palaces and courtyards, it is a must see for anyone visiting Agra. In order to get a full idea of this site it is better to take a guide (₹450 for 2h for its free entry part) or have a good printed guide. Entry to the site of the mosque (even to the yard) is only without wearing footwear. The vehicle parking is about a kilometre away and Agra Development Authority (ADA) runs some rickety non air conditioned buses to the site entrance, fare is ₹10 per person one way. Entry to the fort area where the palaces are located is ₹610 for foreigners.\n* '''Mathura''' is said to be the birthplace of Lord Krishna. There are many beautiful temples in Mathura, including the one built at Shri Krishna's birthplace.\n* '''Nandgaon''' was the home of Shri Krishna's foster father, Nand. On the top of the hill is the spacious temple of Nand Rai, built by the Hat ruler Roop Singh. The other temples here are dedicated to Narsingha, Gopinath, Nritya Gopal, Girdhari, Nand Nandan, and Yasodha Nandan, which is half-way up the hill. Nandgaon springs into action every year around March for the festival of Holi, when many tourists flock to the city for the famous \"lath mar holi\".\n* '''National Chambal Sanctuary''', (70&amp;nbsp;km away) is a natural sanctuary and the home of the endangered Indian ''gharial'' (a relative of the crocodile) and of the Ganges River Dolphin (also endangered).\n* '''Vrindavan''' is also a religious place around 50&amp;nbsp;km from Agra, and quite close to Mathura. There are many temples here devoted to Lord Krishna, a few of the more famous of which are Banke Bihari and the Iskcon Temple.\n\n\n\n"

Since 1997 the Valley of Temples and the other ancient sites in the area have been included in the UNESCO_World_Heritage_List#Italy|UNESCO's World Heritage List.\n\nDuring the golden age of Ancient Greece, it was known as ''Akragas'' (Ἀκράγας). One of the leading cities of Magna Graecia, it was the hometown of philosopher Empedocles. Later on, it became ''Agrigentum'' in Latin, and ''Kirkent'' or ''Jirjent'' in Arabic.\n\nAgrigento is the birthplace of the novelist, poet and playwright Luigi Pirandello who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1934.\n\n===Tourist information===\n* \n\n===Climate===\n\nSimilarly to nearby Gela, Agrigento has a semi-arid climate, with just enough precipitation to avoid being classified as a desert climate. It features hot summers and mild winters. The winter months usually present mild to warm daytime temperatures and the weather is mostly sunny. Summer presents a pronounced aridity in which sunny conditions are virtually assured every day.\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By train===\nFrequent trains run from the station near the centre of town to Palermo and Caltanissetta, less frequently to Enna (but not that useful - the station in Enna is about 5 km ''below'' the town). The journey to/from Palermo takes 2 hours and costs  (as of March 2023). Connecting with the east of Sicily by train is not easy, and takes a long time.\nThe train station is at Piazza Marconi, on the southeast corner of the old town.\n\n* \n* \n\n===By bus===\nFrequent buses run to Palermo (Down the street from Stazione Centrale), Caltanissetta, Catania, Sciacca and close(ish) to Eraclea Minoa.

See [http://www.siremar.it/ SIREMAR] and [http://www.usticalines.it Ustica Lines].

The temples are usually divided into two zones: the Eastern Zone and Western Zone each side of the main entrance and the road from the city centre.\nIt can get punishingly hot in summer and there is little shade other than some olive trees along the ridge. There is a shuttle bus that runs through the site (€3 for one stop, Nov 2019).

(Some ID is required as security for these, which means walking back the entire length of the site just to give the guide back).\n\nTo put all these sights in context, it is well worth visiting the Archeological Museum (half way back into the city centre) and the adjacent Roman Quarter (with a few nice mosaics).\n\n* \n| wikipedia=it:Museo archeologico regionale di Agrigento | image=Agrigent Museum Innenhof.jpg | wikidata=Q1954221\n| lastedit=2017-04-03\n| content=The museum is about half way from the station to the Valley of the Temples and contains artifacts taken from the site.

                    "text": "\n\n'''[http://www.provincia.agrigento.it Agrigento]''' is a province on the southwestern coast of Sicily, Italy, that stretches from the south coast into the mountainous hinterland. The province faces the Channel of Sicily in the south and is known for its beaches. Torre Salsa's beaches have been designated natural reserves and are protected due to their environmental importance.\n\n==Cities==\n\n&lt;!----&gt;\n* — to the south and particularly noted for the Valle dei Templi (Valley of Temples) ()\n* — hilltop village outside Sciacca\n* (''Eraclea Minoa'') — Greek ruins above an attractive beach\n* (''Marina'') — port town close to Agrigento\n* — quiet south coast port town\n* — Working class city between Caltanissetta and Agrigento\n* —\n\n==Other destinations==\n* (''Isole Pelagie'') — most southern, in the Mediterranean Sea\n\n==Understand==\nGela inhabitants founded the province in the 6th century BCE as Akragas. The Carthage destroyed the province in 406 BCE but was later ruled by the Romans, Goths, Byzantines, and Arabs. The Arabs rebuilt several parts of the province. Several ancient Doric temples were constructed during the 6th and 5th century BCE to worship Hercules, Olympian Jupiter, Juno, Castor, Pollux, and Demeter. They are located in the Valley of Temples (''Valle dei Templi''). The ancient temples and other architectural structures were built using the stones of the hills near Capo San Marco.\n\n===Climate ===\nIn summer it can be unbearably hot in Sicily with its arid Mediterranean climate, in winter the temperatures are often pleasant and snow hardly ever falls. In spring and autumn, the temperatures are very pleasant, apart from the sometimes heavy thunderstorms.\n\n==Get in==\n===By car===\nFrom the A19 Palermo - Catania motorway to Caltanissetta, then on the SS640, through the mountains to the south coast. Alternatively on the southern coastal road SS115, which runs along the entire southern coast of Sicily from Trapani to Siracusa.\n\n===By train===\nFerrovia Palermo - Agrigento - Porto Empedocle line or Agrigento - Caltanissetta line and then connection to the Palermo - Catania line.\n\n==Get around==\nThe region can be easily travelled by car. With larger vehicles or mobile homes, caution is advised in narrow towns, scooters can get through everywhere without any problems.\n\nAs in all of Italy, people drive in Sicily quite \"impulsively\" and quickly. As a rule, it is important to be very attentive at all times, but this also applies to local road users: in rural Sicily, the right-of-way is often not stubbornly insisted on — a vehicle is sometimes allowed to enter from a turner or stopped for a left turn, the traffic partners mist clearly see what you are planning to do.\n\nTravelling in the region by public transport is challenging, railway connections are rare, all towns and cities are connected by a dense bus network, the website of the Sicilian bus company AST seems a bit confusing and is written in fluent Italian.\n\n==See==\nNear Agrigento, the Valley of the Temples (''Valle dei Templi'') has many temples from Greek antiquity. Eraclea Minoa is an archaeological site with a Greek theatre. Capo Bianco, near the bathing beach of Cattolica Eraclea and Scala dei Turchi, a rocky coast with stepped white marl formations, are both recommended. \n\n==Do==\n* \n\n==Eat==\nThe Sicilian cuisine in the southern provinces is similar to that of Italy: fish and fresh seafood are mainly offered in the port cities, in the mountain areas ham and mountain cheese are instead on the appetizer plate.\n\n==Drink==\nThe province is well known for its vineyards and wines. Around three-quarters of the Sicilian land devoted to growing Fiano grapes is in the province. Some of the important municipalities known for their vineyards include Sambuca di Sicilia, Menfi, and Santa Margherita di Belice.\n\n==Stay safe==\nSecurity in southern Sicily is not much different from other rural areas of Italy. Pickpocketing  and car break-ins are to be expected if valuables are left in the vehicle. However, the risk is no greater than in large cities in northern Europe.\n\n==Go next==\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

                    "text": "\n'''Agritourism''' means travel organized around farming, small-scale food production or animal husbandry. Visiting a working farm or ranch for the purpose of enjoyment and education are key parts of this often rural experience. Farmer's markets, wine tourism, cider houses and corn mazes all constitute examples of agritourism. Travelers who participate in this type of vacation frequently desire to see how food is grown and prepared or to learn how animals are raised.\nImage:Pumpkins Farmer's Market Montreal Canada.JPG|thumb|270px|Pumpkins in a Farmer's Market, [[Montreal, Canada]]\n==Understand==\n\n\nSometimes spelled \"agrotourism,\" '''agritourism''' is the idea of bringing urban residents to rural areas for leisure travel and spending.\n\nIn an increasingly mechanized world, many people have lost touch with how their food is produced, or the region where it originated. Agritourism offers tourists a chance to reconnect with the land, providing a \"hands on experience\" with local foods. Agritourism activities include picking fruits, tasting wine, tending bees, milking cows and other educational pursuits.\n\nAgritourism immerses visitors in the heritage of a particular culture. Take the time to stop by a working farm or ranch,  you will most likely discover people with an intimate knowledge of the history and traditions of their region. A traveler to Agros in Cyprus who helps the villagers gather roses in May, will learn something about the area's history producing rose water. Horseback riding on a dude ranch in Montana offers a glimpse into the lives of cowboys from the \"Old West\" of the United States of America|U.S.. A visit to a food museum such as the [http://www.luberon-en-provence.com/infosa.html Musee de la Boulangerie Rurale] in Luberon can teach about the history of rural breadmaking in the Provence region of France.\n\nFor the most iconic agritourism areas, safeguarding the integrity of their products is nothing less than a source of national pride.  In the European Union, Protected Designation of Origins (PDOs) look after the integrity of a wide variety of foods, such as Champagne wine in France, Asiago cheese in Italy and Melton Mowbray meat pies in England. All these regions are eponymous with the foods they produce, while a tourism industry has sprung up around that particular food's production.\n\nLike sustainable travel, agritourism focuses on travel that is low-impact and empowering to local communities, both socially and economically. Recognizing the need to diversify their farm products and supplement their agricultural incomes, many farmers consider agritourism as a viable option for the long-term sustainability of their farms. Agritourism can prop up an agricultural economy when local producers can no longer compete economically. The tourism takes place in a farm setting and is secondary to the primary agricultural operation.\n\n==Overnight stays==\nThis can be as sophisticated as a bed and breakfast stay at a winery or as rustic as camping. One common variation is a farm stay, where guests help feed the animals and harvest the crops.\n\nImage:Bacharach vineyard Rhine Valley Germany.jpg|thumb|270px|Vineyards in [[Bacharach along the Rhine Valley, Germany ]]\n\n===Farms===\nIn Europe, it's referred to as \"schlaf im Stroh\" in German, \"aventure sur la paille\" in French, or \"sleeping in the hay\" in English. Spend the night on a farm and help out with domestic chores and demonstrations of native crafts.  This could be an overnight stay in a rustic hayloft in Switzerland, a remote cabin or outbuilding in Austria, or even a full-blown apartment and rooms for daily or weekly rent on a farm in France.

The largest comprise a '''livestock show''' (a judged event or display in which breeding stock is exhibited), a trade fair, competitions, and entertainment. The work and practices of farmers, animal fanciers, cowboys and zoologists may be displayed. The terms ''agricultural show'' and ''livestock show'' are synonymous with the North American term '''county fair''' or '''state fair'''.\n\nAgricultural shows are an important part of cultural life in small country towns, and popular events in larger towns and cities. Shows range from small events in small country towns usually lasting two days, through medium-sized events of three days, to large Royal Shows, which may run for up to two weeks and combine elements of an amusement park with those of an agricultural show. Although increasingly under pressure due to finances and insurance concerns, all main towns in the United Kingdom have a Show Society and in some areas, several towns and villages in the area all have an annual show. Larger shows often include live entertainment and fireworks in the main arena.\n\n===Farm stands===\n===Farmer's markets===\n\n*'''[http://www.farma.org.uk/ National Farmers' Retail &amp; Markets Association (FARMA)]''' — A co-operative of farmers, producers selling on a local scale, and farmers markets in the United Kingdom.

Aguascalientes was founded in 1575. The city is very Spanish in nature and is known for its pottery, embroideries and woven goods. Aguascalientes, Mexico is the capital city of Aguascalientes state. Historically, the Spanish chose this city as an outpost to guard against the Chichimec Indians who once resided in the area. It was an outpost against the Indian tribes until 1857 when a state of republic was created under the same name as the state, Aguascalientes. From 1910 to 1920 the city was a major rail junction between Mexico City and the silver mines of Zacatecas.\n\nNatives call Aguascalientes \"the perforated city\" or La Ciudad Perforada due to its intertwining passages, or catacombs beneath it that the pre-colonial Indians carved from rock.

                    "text": "\n\n'''Aguas Calientes''' (now officially ''Machu Picchu Pueblo'') is a small town at the bottom of the valley next to Machu Picchu, and the principal access point to the site. All visitors to Machu Picchu pass through Aguas Calientes and most spend at least one night here.\n\n==Understand==\nThe town is perched on the bank of the Urubamba river. Across the river are sheer cliffs, and a creek flows down from the jungle into the river, bisecting the town. Several small bridges cross the creek. Virtually all of the town is pedestrian-only, making it very easy to get around.\n\n==Get in==\nImage:Machupicchu85.JPG|thumb|350px|Aguas Calientes\nThere are no roads into Aguas Calientes. You must arrive by train or by foot.\n\n===By train===\n\nTwo train companies serve Aguas Calientes. Try to book several days in advance if possible, especially in the high season. Tickets can be purchased online, or at travel agency and ticket offices in Cusco. Upon leaving the train station you will enter a warren of market stalls. Stay straight to head to the stream running through town where you can get your bearings.\n\n==== Peru Rail ====\n'''[http://www.perurail.com Peru Rail]''' has two stations: Ollanta and Poroy. There are several departures daily, varying greatly in price. Pay attention to the station when buying tickets online, as the website presents both stations in the same timetable. Tickets should be bought in advance either online or at the Peru Rail office on the Plaze de Armas in Cusco. It is not possible to select your seats online, so if you have a preference, buy them at the station. Printed tickets are required, although they can be printed at the Poroy station at the ticketing office (and likely at Ollanta, although this has not been confirmed). The fares start at US$35 one way in the 'Backpackers' cars, which have decently comfortable seats and small snacks available for purchase. The 'Vistadome' cars are the mid-range cars, with nicer seats and included snacks. There is also a luxury option called 'Hiram Bingham', complete with gourmet meals and an observation carriage.\n\nPoroy is a 20-min taxi ride from the Cusco Plaza de Armas and is the most convienent option for passengers departing from Cusco. However, in the rainy season Peru Rail only runs trains from Ollanta and ferries passengers via shuttle buses.\n\nOllanta is in Ollantaytambo, which is a small town 1hr 45min from Cusco. To get to Ollantaytambo, take a collectivo from Calle Pavitos in Cusco, S/15 (Peru#Money|soles) per person. They start early in the morning, around 03:00, and run every half hour. Look for a newish van with seatbelts. Ollantaytambo is a small town with ruins of its own, and one popular route is to take the bus, spend a night in Ollantaytambo, then take the train to Aguas Calientes the next morning. The scenic train journey through the Sacred Valley of the Incas|Sacred Valley takes about 3hr 45min from Poroy and 1hr 45min from Ollanta.\n\n==== Inca Rail ====\n'''[http://incarail.com/ Inca Rail]''' also serves Aguas Calientes. Prices and service are similar to Peru Rail. The \"bimodal\" service is a combination of a minibus from Av de Sol in Cusco to Ollantaytambo, where you transfer to the Inca Rail train to Machu Picchu (in Aguas Calientes). Both the bus and rail sections are very scenic. \n&lt;!-- The Inca rail website makes no mention of going to Pachar, so I'm commenting this out. Can anyone confirm?:   Since 2015, due to flood damage to the tracks, trains cannot reach Poroy. A new temporary station has been created at Pachar, even nearer to Aguas Calientes. A free bus service is provided from Wanchac station in Cusco, taking about 1¾ hours to reach Pachar, from where it is 90 minutes to reach Aguas Calientes. If you have booked tickets from Poroy, you need to be at Cusco Wanchaq about 45 minutes earlier than the stated time. Don't worry: there are loads of English-speaking staff around to help (and dishing out free bottles of water).--&gt;\n\n===By car and foot/train===\n\nSeveral tour agencies offer a \"Machu Picchu by car\" tour for S/60-100 - an inexpensive way to get to Machu Picchu from Cusco. These start around 07:00 in the morning to go to Hidroelectrica on a 6-7 hour car ride up and down a very curvy mountain road with very spectacular views along the road. From there you walk to Aguas Calientes for 2½-3 hours. It is an easy, flat walk, you just have to follow the train tracks. It's also possible to catch a train at 14:50 for US$32 (Jul 2019). You'll spend the night in Agua Calientes and get up to Machu Picchu very early the next day, usually around 04:00. Minivans back to Cusco leave Hidroelectrica at around 14:30. This means leaving Machu Picchu at around 11:00. It's just enough time to visit the site for 3-4 hours, but not enough to climb Wayna Picchu or Montana.\n\nIf you want to have more time at Machu Picchu (recommended if you have the time), you can also organize the trip yourself: book the transport at a tour agency (S/70-80 for the round trip), book two nights in Aguas Calientes (there are plenty hotels and hostels to choose from), and buy your ticket for Machu Picchu in the Ministerio de Cultura in Cusco.\n\n===By foot===\n\nIt is also possible to hike downstream along the railway tracks from Ollantaytambo or from the town at km 82, where the Inca trail starts. This is about a seven-hour hike (hiking ''on'' the train tracks is prohibited).\n\nIt's also possible to hike upstream along the train tracks from Santa Teresa (Peru)|Santa Teresa (4 hours) or Hidroeléctrica (2 hours). You can take a minibus directly to Hidroeléctrica from Cusco for S/50 or make the journey by public transport. To reach Santa Teresa, take a bus towards Quillabamba from Cusco and get off at Santa Maria. The bus leaves Cusco at 08:00 (from the Santiago bus depot - S/20) and passes through Ollantaytambo, Urubumba and Santa Maria. It's a 7-hour journey from Cusco to Santa Maria. You can also take a minivan (''colectivo'') which leaves next to the buses (S/25-30 - 4 hours). At Santa Maria, take a connecting bus to Santa Teresa (S/6, 1½ hours) or a taxi (S/10, 1 hour). Walk 2 hours or catch a bus (S/5) to the hydro electric plant (''planta hidroeléctrica''). From there it's 2½-3 hours of walking to Aguas Calientes, and it's an easy walk, you just to follow the train tracks. It's also possible to catch a train for US$28 (May 2015) to Aguas Calientes, possibly much cheaper if you are Peruvian (leaves ''hidroeléctrica'' at 16:00 and for Peruvians it's S/10). As the tracks are still in use, be careful, especially when crossing bridges and in the tunnels.\n\nThere are also hiking paths coming from Mollepata, Cachora and Huanicapa for the extremely adventurous. You will want to get your hands on some topographical maps beforehand. ''Hiking and Trekking around Cusco'' is available for S/25-30 and has details on the routes you can take.\n\n==Get around==\n\nThe town is compact and walkable, and there are no vehicles apart from the buses to Machu Picchu and a few work vehicles.\n\n==See==\n* \n\n==Do==\n\nAguas Calientes is in the cloud forest, and there are several hikes in the jungle and along the river. The town also offers the usual activities for a tourist location, as well as the thermal baths that give the town its name.\n\nBirdwatchers can find Torrent Ducks and White-Capped Dippers in the river, and Andean Cock-of-the-Rocks--the national bird of Peru--can be found in the jungle outside of town. Several books are available discussing the bird life near and around Machu Picchu and Aguas Calientes that also discuss birds that can be found in the cloud forest.\n\nIn town:\n\n*\n*\n* \n\nGoing downstream towards Santa Teresa, you can follow the train tracks or follow the road along the river. This road runs until it reaches a bridge that crosses the river where the road winds up to Machu Picchu. At this point you can turn right and cut up to the train tracks and continue to follow the river along the tracks. Walk on the tracks is prohibited and dangerous. In the downstream direction you can find:\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\nGoing upstream towards Ollantaytambo:\n\nFollowing the train tracks upstream from Machu Picchu Pueblo towards Ollantaytambo you will see some other ruins and a waterfall.\n\n==Buy==\n\nPrices on most things are relatively high, so if you're on a very tight budget, bring some snacks and water from Cusco. If you're planning to use a credit card for hotel or purchases, note that most places only accept Visa. However, prices on basics such as snacks and water are not much higher than Cusco and the Sacred Valley.\n\nThere is a big '''market''' along the road to Machu Picchu, and a big '''handicraft market''' in front of the railway station.\n\nSome shops sell hand-painted t-shirts, which are far more expensive than other t-shirts in Peru but are a little more creative.\n\n==Eat==\n\nThere are many restaurants catering to travelers. Prices can be expected to be somewhat higher due to the isolation of Aguas Calientes and the difficulty of importing supplies. Some travelers have reported incorrectly calculated bills and hidden charges on bills. One ploy to be aware of is for the bill to be 10-15% more than advertised due to \"tax\" and \"servicio\". This is fairly easy to avoid if you are aware of it - when the tout is inviting you into the restaurant, he or she will name a price. Agree to the price and say, \"No tax, no servicio, no nada mas.\" When they bring the bill, you may have to remind them of this agreement, but there is usually no problem if it is agreed up front. The waiter may tell you he earns no wages, and the service charge is his only pay, but this is not true. Only ever pay what is advertised.\n\nThe town is full of pizza restaurants, which are a safe option.\n\nThere are also Chifa restaurants (Chinese food) and Peruvian restaurants serving set menus. These will usually run S/10-15, and depending on where you go will be something along the lines of ''palta rellena'' (stuffed avocado), soup, main course (generally trout, beef or chicken), tea, coffee, fruit juice, wine or pisco sour.\n\nThe smaller restaurants up the hill will often offer more food for half the price of the larger establishments, and the quality is usually the same.\n\nThere are two cafes outside the entrance to Machu Picchu that have decent cafe-style food and are surprisingly reasonable.\n\n* \n\n==Drink==\nMany bars try to lure in customers with 4-for-1 happy hours lasting the whole evening. Beware that the price is fourfold of the normal prices in Cusco. These \"four\" cocktails are also each about the size of one normal-priced cocktail. It is often not a terrible deal, but it is not truly four-for-one.\n\nSigns warn that it is not allowed to sell and/or consume alcoholic beverages after 23:00. However, it's not too hard to find a place to drink some beers after this time.\n\n==Sleep==\n\nThere are many sleeping options in Aguas Calientes. There is one very expensive hotel right next to the Machu Picchu entrance.\n\n===Budget===\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Mid-range===\n\n* \n* \n*\n*\n*\n* \n* \n\n===Splurge===\n* \n\n==Connect==\n\nInternet cafes are spread around the town with slow connections. They offer local and long-distance calls as well. They charge S/3-4 per hour and there are also CD and DVD burning facilities to store your photos. DVDs cost S/15 each to burn.\n\n==Stay healthy==\n\nThere is a 24-hour '''pharmacy''' \"Multiservicios Botica Carita Feliz\" in Calle Collasuyo, north-west of the main square Plaza Manco Ccapac.\n\n==Go next==\n\n* Cusco take the train.\n* Ollantaytambo take the train.\n* Santa Teresa (Peru)|Santa Teresa head down stream, its about a four hour hike.\n* Choquequirao you'll need camping equipment, food, a map and GPS would be good too.\n\n\n\n"

                    "text": "\n\n\n\n'''Ahmedabad''' (Gujarati phrasebook|Gujarati: અમદાવાદ ''Amdāvād'') is the fifth largest city in India with a population of 6.5 million. Although it is the commercial hub of one of the most prosperous states of India, Gujarat, it's not the state capital, which is its twin city of Gandhinagar,  to the north.\n\nAhmedabad is a good example of contrast between the materialistic attitude and the spirituality of self-renunciation. One of the fastest growing cities in India, Ahmedabad is a centre for information technology, education and industries. Bhadra Fort, Shaking Minarets and Tran Darwaja are the foremost historical sites of the city. Kankaria Lake and Vastrapur Lake are places which let you feel the pleasure of nature. If you want to enjoy the colourful side of this area, then pay a visit during the major festivals of Ahmedabad: Uttarayan and Navratri are two festivals that are celebrated with great zeal and gusto. Winter is considered the best time to visit the city.\n\n==Districts==\nThe classification below is according to Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). The West Zone and New West Zone are on the west side of the Sabarmati River while all other zones are on the east side. Locals rarely refer to these zones, but rather to one of dozens of neighbourhoods of which the city is made up.\n\n\n\n== Understand ==\n\n\n===History===\nThe City was built by Sultan Ahmed Shah, who conquered Gujarat and created a new city nearby, naming it Ahmedabad, after himself.\n\nThe city was built in an open and spacious plain to the east of the Sabarmati River. It included a smaller known fort as Bhadra Fort. The city wall had twelve gates. The city gradually expanded in every direction, with well laid out beautiful buildings, lakes and mosques on both sides of the river.\n\nIn 1753 the combined armies of Raghunath Rao and Damaji Gaekwad took the fort, ending Mughal rule in Ahmedabad. During the 64 years of rule by Gaekwad and Peshwa, the city became cleaner. In 1818 the British annexed Ahmedabad. During this period the municipality committee was founded and a railway link was established.\n\n\nThe British restricted themselves to the cantonment area and didn't take much interest in the city. Nor did they get around to colonising Ahmedabad culturally; they didn't set up schools, churches and clubs all over the city as they did in other cities they integrated to their way of life.\n\nAhmedabad was a cradle of the non-violent movement for India's independence, being host to the Sabarmati ''ashram'' of Mahatma Gandhi. Ahmedabad poses a mixture of rich tradition and modern feel.\n\n\n\n===Today===\nThe Gujarati community is known for its hospitality and for being shrewd businessmen.

Hindi is understood by almost everyone and English understood by well-educated people and most people in the tourism industry.\n\n== Get in ==\n===By plane===\n*|directions=It is in the area of Hansol, just  north-east from the city-centre | content= The airport is expanding with permissions for many international air lines being given and development of new terminals. |url=http://www.ahmedabadairport.com/}}\n\nInternational flight connections include Muscat, London Heathrow (Air India), Kuwait (Kuwait Airways), Dubai (Emirates), Doha (Qatar Airways), Sharjah (Air Arabia) and Singapore (Singapore Airlines).\n\nDomestic destinations with daily flights include Mumbai, Delhi, Indore, Chennai, Bangalore, Goa, Kolkata, Jaipur, Pune, Coimbatore, Hyderabad, Nagpur, Kandla and Surat. Most domestic airlines have a flight in and out of Ahmedabad.\n\nPassengers arriving in the morning are advised that the international terminal is not open 24 hours, and may not open until the late afternoon. As at other Indian airports, you will likely be denied entry until approximately three hours before your scheduled flight even if the terminal is open. Therefore, connecting between a domestic and an international flight will often involve waiting outside for hours with the throngs of touts and hustlers.\n\nThere are several options for getting from the airport to the city:\n\n* By '''car''': The Hansol area where the airport is lies near the river banks, between the areas of Shahibaug and Naroda that give access to Ahmedabad. For travelling to most of the main areas of Ahmedabad, head in the direction of '''Shahibaug'''. To the opposite of the river banks is the area of '''Motera - Chandkheda''' which are the northern ends of Ahmedabad and are better accessible through '''Koteshwar - Bhat Road''' (enters Motera through Koteshwar) or '''Ring Road''' (leading to '''Visat''', turning left at Tapovan Circle); both these roads branch at different points on the road from Airport Circle (in direction of Naroda from the airport) to Koba Circle (take left from Airport Circle onto Indira Bridge). Also the SG Highway can be accessed by heading straight on the Ring Road, instead of turning left for Visat.\n* An '''auto rickshaw''' or a '''taxi''' should cost roughly ₹ 200 or 300 respectively. Save yourself considerable hassle by using the prepaid booth, or preferably arrange a pickup in advance with your hotel.\n* '''AMTS buses''' serve the airport directly. These buses have an extensive network all over the city.\n* '''BRTS bus''' no 1000 runs between the airport and Karnavati club with 29 stops. The maximum fare is ₹50. The buses have AC and arrive every 30 minutes.\n\n===By train===\nIndian Railways has a very wide network all over India. There are multiple stations in Ahmedabad. The website of '''[http://www.indianrail.gov.in Indian Railways]''' will show you trains from a particular station to your destination along with days, timings, fares and availability. This will help you find trains from individual stations of Ahmedabad (separate searches) as ''not'' all trains stop at all stations except of course, Ahmedabad Junction (ADI) where each train halts (and for longer durations than any other station). Booking can be done through the website of '''[https://www.irctc.co.in IRCTC]''', a subsidiary of Indian Railways ''or'' through any of the railway reservation centres throughout India.\n\n====Ahmedabad Junction====\n\n|wikidata=Q4696124}} (station code: '''ADI''') is connected with Mumbai (500&amp;nbsp;km), Vadodara Jaipur, Jodhpur and Delhi with trains several times a day.

AMTS buses also have a stop nearby.\n\n===By car===\n\n====From South Gujarat, and Maharashtra====\nDriving to Ahmedabad from Mumbai on the new highway ('''NH-8''') takes around 8 hours (without traffic) to travel 550 km. You'll pass Vapi, Valsad, '''Surat''', Bharuch, '''Vadodara''', Anand, and Nadiad on your way. Driving on the NH-8 is an energy sapper and no fun as there is a huge amount of truck traffic. Broken down trucks on the highway regularly cause traffic jams for hours on end. The journey from Vadodara to Ahmedabad can also be done via the dedicated express way ('''NE-1''') which does not pass through any towns, rather than NH-8.\n\nThe expressway from Vadodara (South Gujarat) to Ahmedabad ends at C.T.M. (Ahmedabad/South Zone|South Zone).\n\n=====Via east=====\nTurning right at C.T.M. is the Narol - Naroda Road leading you to Naroda in North East Ahmedabad, while passing through the areas of Vastral, Odhav, Nikol, etc. on the right side of the road and the areas of Maninagar, Shastri Nagar, Hansol (Airport Area) on the left side of the road. For the northern areas of Sabarmati, Motera, Chandkheda, etc.rcle, where the Narol - Naroda Road ends, head straight on NH-8 and turn left at Ranasan Circle onto Ring Road. Turn left at Tapovan Circle, after a few km, Motera will be on the left side of the highway, Chandkheda on the right. The highway ends at Visat, from where turning left will lead you to Sabarmati.\n\n=====Via west=====\nTurning left at C.T.M. is the Narol - Sarkhej Road which passes through Nehrunagar, Narol, Vatwa, Ghodasar, etc. ending at a T-junction on Vasna Road (or Jawaharlal Nehru Road). From here turn left, pass through the areas of Juhapura, Makarba, etc. till a Y-junction arrives. The right arm will lead you to Sarkhej Cross Roads, from where you turn right onto the S G Highway. The left arm at the Y-junction will lead you via Sarkhej, at Santhal Circle, turn right onto the Ring Road.\n\nRing Road is preferable if your destination is far (near Northern Ahmedabad) otherwise use Sarkhej–Gandhinagar Highway (S G Highway). Also for Bopal, use only Ring Road.\n\nThe major entry points from S G Highway are the areas of Prahladnagar, Shilaj, Vastrapur, Satellite, Bodakdev, Thaltej, Sola, Ognaj, Gota, etc.\n\n====From Gandhinagar, North Gujarat, and Rajasthan====\n\n\n=====Via north and east=====\nYou can enter Ahmedabad by passing through Gandhinagar. The intercity highway starts at Indroda Circle (CH 0) (South Gandhinagar), passing through Koba Circle and Tapovan Circle and ends at Visat (Northern Ahmedabad/West Zone|West Zone), the junction to the suburbs of Sabarmati, Motera and Chandkheda. Rather than going to Visat, you can also choose to join Ring Road: From Koba Circle head on the road to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel (SVP) International Airport, but turn left at Rajasthan Hospital Circle and you're on Ring Road. From here you can connect to the areas of East Ahmedabad such as Nikol, Odhav, Vastral, etc. Also the southern areas of Ahmedabad, such as Ramol, CTM, Ahmedabad - Vadodara Expressway, Narol, Vatwa, etc. are accessible through Ring Road.\n\n=====Via west=====\nAnother option is to bypass Gandhinagar using Mahatma Mandir Road, then turning right at Sargasan Circle onto S G Highway. You may stay on the S G Highway or turn right at SGVP Circle (also known as Vaishnodevi Circle) onto Ring Road. There are several entry points along the border of extreme Western Ahmedabad, such as Gota, Ognaj, Sola, Thaltej, Bodakdev, Satellite, Vastrapur, Shilaj, Bopal, Prahladnagar, Sarkhej (where S G Highway ends) and Juhapura. For getting to Bopal, use Ring Road rather than S G Highway. Also if you've to go to Southern Ahmedabad, choose Ring Road as it'll be a much faster option than S G Highway.\n\n== Get around ==\nImage:Ahmedabad City Tourist Map.png|thumb|right|Tourist Map of Ahmedabad\nThe services of AMTS and BRTS run from 6AM to 11PM.\n\n===By AMTS city bus===\nThe local city buses are run by  since 1947, forming a wide network covering almost all the points of Ahmedabad. Any destination in the city can be reached from anywhere in the city by AMTS.UTTAR PRADESH\n\n\nTo identify them and distinguish them from the state transport GSRTC buses or the private luxury buses here is the key: The older buses in this service are painted in ''red and white'' or in ''red and yellow'', whereas new bright red ones put up under '''JnNURM''' are having electronic display boards. You may easily ask around the people esp. those waiting at one of the AMTS stops about the route, time, etc. as the information displayed is in Gujarati. Also, Public Transit option on Google Maps will show you the nearest AMTS stop while searching directions from your location to the destination and it also gives information about the bus numbers, transfer points, etc. though timings might not be reliable. Also you may install an unofficial app named 'Ahmedabad AMTS Info', available on Google Play Store for Android devices, which guides you regarding travel routes, transfers, etc.\n\n\n\nThere are other terminals at Kalupur, Sarangpur, Old Vadaj (Juna Vadaj), Maninagar, Akhbarnagar (Nava Vadaj), Vasna and Naroda and the depots at Jamalpur, Memco (Naroda Patiya) and Memnagar. In total, AMTS has around 1200 stops with 210 routes.\n\nIt is mandatory to board the bus from the rear end door and alight from the front end one. The conductor on the bus will issue you a ticket according to your destination stop. Keep handy some notes of ₹ 10/20/50 denominations rather than the higher ones as the fares are very low (''these buses are the cheapest means to travel in the city''). A ''pay - per - ride'' fare will cost you a minimum fare of ₹ 3, while the maximum fare is only '''₹ 25'''). You may also opt to buy a ''Man Pasand'' ticket worth ₹ 45 (available from the bus conductor) which entitles you to unlimited rides for a single day, though it is not preferable to purchase the ₹ 45 ticket as you can complete the journey of going around 4-5 places in just ₹ 30–35. As buses are the most common transport facility for many in the city they are often overcrowded.\n\nDuring the journey you may request your co-passengers or the conductor to inform you when the destination arrives/is about to arrive so that you don't miss getting off at your stop and then have to take a reverse trip. Also keep moving towards the front end door as the bus will be crowded with people standing in the corridor between seats and it might be difficult to quickly rush to the door and get off, when your destination arrives (the bus won't halt at a stop more than 10-12 sec, unless it's the AMTS Central Terminus at Lal Darwaja or the last stop of the journey).\n\nRoutes can be found at [https://sites.google.com/site/indiabus/amtsbus '''AMTS bus routes''' (''English'')]\n\n====Heritage/Pilgrim Tours (Dekho Amdavad)====\nAMTS has a special programme Dekho Amdavad, i.e. See Ahmedabad for sight-seeing in Ahmedabad.

BRTS does not cover the entire city, but wherever available it is the best way to commute as it is ''remarkably faster'' than other modes (as no other vehicle can ply on BRTS corridor) and all the stations are marked well, in both English and Hindi. One can also travel using a combination of BRTS, AMTS and/or auto rickshaw. The ticket systems of BRTS and AMTS are not integrated. The fares are only slightly higher than AMTS (min. fare ₹ 4, max. fare ₹ 36)\n\nThe BRTS stations are elevated shelters in the dedicated central corridor of the city roads, from where you can purchase your ticket. Keep the ticket with you until you get off at your destination, where you show the ticket to the checker and then leave the station on to the road. Buses are equipped with central automatic doors that open up automatically when the bus halts at a station. While the bus is about to arrive at a station, there are announcements with name of the station along with display on the electronic board inside the bus. Inside the stations, there are boards displaying real-time information about arrivals or upcoming buses, along with the routes and estimated time remaining for the arrivals. The name of the station will be printed in white letters on blue strips on the sides (horizontal) and on the roof of the station (vertical).\n\nAll BRTS buses and stations are wheelchair accessible ''except'' those of RTO Circle and Kalupur Railway Station, which are roadside shelters unlike the standard BRTS stations.\n\nFor information on all the BRTS stations, visit the above-linked website, which shows them according to the line, or install an unofficial [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.hammerapps.brts&amp;hl=en Android app], which provides information such as travel options, routes, fare, time, station names, etc. (The Public Transit option on Google Maps ''doesn't'' show BRTS services, only the AMTS ones)\n\nThere are 12 BRTS lines and 126 stations, with more under construction. The current lines are:\n\n*'''Line 1''' RTO Circle - Maninagar\n*'''Line 2''' Anjali (Vasna) - Naroda\n*'''Line 3''' RTO Circle - Naroda\n*'''Line 4''' RTO Circle - Sarkari Litho Press (Delhi Darwaja)\n*'''Line 5''' Bopal - Iskcon - Maninagar\n*'''Line 6''' Soni Ni Chali - Odhav - S P Ring Road\n*'''Line 7''' Sarkari Litho Press (Delhi Darwaja) - Science City Approach\n*'''Line 8''' Chandkheda - Visat Junction - Maninagar\n*'''Line 9''' RTO Circle - Town Hall (Ellisbridge)\n*'''Line 10''' Anjali (Vasna) - Kalupur Railway Station (Ahmedabad Central)\n*'''Line 12''' RTO Circle - Nehrunagar - Kalupur - RTO Circle\n*'''Line 13''' [http://www.jquell.com Anjali (Vasna) - Kalupur - Akhbarnagar - Anjali (Vasna)]\n\n===By metro===\n\n\n\n===By auto rickshaw===\n\nThese yellow and green three-wheeled noise machines, known as auto-rickshaws or simply rickshaws, are always cheaper than taxis, and much costlier than AMTS or BRTS when distance is longer than 3&amp;nbsp;km. They are not very comfortable and spacious. The drivers might ride very roughly, in which case you might request him to drive smoothly and slowly.\n\nShouting 'auto' or 'rickshaw' at a passing rickshaw should be enough to catch the drivers attention. In most cases, the drivers will be able to understand Hindi and maybe even a few words of English. They are normally quite helpful, but some will try to cheat tourists. As always, agree on a fare before getting in. Day and night fares are different. If you look an out-of-the-town person, you may end up getting overcharged. For example, he might insist on a fare based on meter and take you to your destination through a longer route. Having some understanding about the distances can be helpful.\n\n===By taxi===\nSince auto rickshaws are the dominant travel mode apart from BRTS and AMTS, there are few taxis in Ahmedabad. So you will hardly find a taxi on the roads to hail whenever needed, though you may either book a taxi from a hotel or directly book one outside the railway station. There is a government authorized taxi stand. ₹ 950 per day for 12 hours. It may be more costly to book through hotels, and it is better to negotiate with the driver directly. Online bookings are also possible at various websites.\n\n== See ==\nAhmedabad has several floridly carved historic monuments including the Stepwell at Adalaj and the Rani Mosques (dedicated to Rani Sipri and Rani Rupmati).

Ahmedabad is famous for its ice-creams because of abundance of dairy products in the state and Gujaratis' penchant for sweets. Local specialities include Dhokla, Khandvi, Srikhand, Haandvo, Bhajiya amongst others.\n\nA famous food from Ahmedabad and/or Gujarat is the 'Cheese and Pineapple Jam sandwich which is sold by most sandwich vendors in Gujarat, especially in Ahmedabad, despite this dish being famous in Gujarat, the other parts of India find this dish to be disgusting, wait till you actually try the sandwich!\n\nThere are lots of Gujarati dining halls where you can get unlimited \"thali\" meals for around ₹250. A thali consists of variety of concoctions including salads, appetizers, snacks, breads, pulses, vegetable curries and sweets.\n\nIf you have not stayed in India for long, select a food place which is famous and well organised (hotels, big restaurants). Otherwise, its fun to eat at one of the road side stalls, especially at the Khau Galli in Law Garden area and Khan Pan Bazaar in Manekchawk. Various stalls open in the evening until late at night. You may enjoy Paani - Puri (Gol Gappa), Indian Chat, Indian Sandwiches, North Indian, Indian-Chinese and some continental cuisines, amazingly at road-side stalls and for less than a ₹60 item. Sarkhej–Gandhinagar Highway (SG Road) in New West Zone has transformed into a restaurant strip. It has over 100 restaurants in a five-mile stretch offering most varieties in all price ranges.\n\n*'''Sankalp''' (Area: Chimanlal Girdharlal Road, SG Road) A chain with outlets across them city that specialises in South Indian food. It set an Guinness World Record for the \"longest dosa (thin-crepe) in the World\" (25 feet)\n*'''Honest''' (Area: Panchwati, SG Road, etc.) A well-known fast-food chain that started as road-side stall serving Pav-Bhaji and Pulav in Law Garden area and now a fledging restaurant chain\n\n*'''Mirch Masala''' (Area: Chimanlal Girdharlal Road, SG Road) Serves North-Indian food in a typical highway \"dhaba\" setting. Excellent food but more interesting for its decor.\n\nOther than these that are several other restaurants that serve excellent food for example (Swati Snacks, House of MG both famous for Gujarati food in chic setting, Bawarchi for Punjabi food, etc.) For western palates, a good way to find new restaurants is to ask a local, especially someone young who would certainly know about such places. International chains like Pizza Hut, McDonalds, Subway are present throughout the city.\n\n== Drink ==\nGujarat is one of the few Indian states where alcohol is prohibited. But this applies only to Indians. If you have a non-Indian passport / green card holder/ PR status, you can get an alcohol permit valid for one month by going to an alcohol shop in a large hotel and purchasing one. Hotels that have alcohol shops include: Cama Hotel in Khanpur, Hotel Inder Residency, Opp. to Gujarat College, Comfort Inn  President Hotel at CG Road among others open Monday to Saturday noon-8PM, ph no. +91 79 26467575. Many local people will be able to direct you because they can purchase alcohol on a 'health' licence. If you are non-resident of Gujarat, then one can get alcohol permits issued at alcohol shops on showing proof of travel to Ahmedabad like (1) Air/Train/Bus ticket,(2) any Identity proof by Govt. with Photo, Address &amp; birthdate preferably driving licence and (3a) your Ahmedabad address proof such as Residence Address of Local friend/relatives electric/telephone bill/ driving licence or (3b) Proof of stay at hotel.\n\nHowever, if you are staying longer you will need a non-resident permit. For that, you will need: a photocopy of passport including your entry stamps, a photocopy of visa, a photocopy of a local resident's ID card (drivers licence will probably be easiest). As of January 2009, ₹1000 (although the person may ask for ₹50 extra as a bribe but should not be given). If you can get a local person to go with you, the entire experience will be a lot easier.\n\nDirections\n1 Get your copies notarized as ‘true’ copies. If you don't have easy access to someone who can do this, the Prohibition and Excise Department will direct you to a nearby office. This will cost about ₹10 per copy.\n2. Go to Prohibition and Excise Department which is just off the Ellis bridge on the Victoria garden side of old city .\n3. Pick up the bank payment form, and get copies notarized if you haven't already done this.\n4. Fill in the name and local address for the permit holder\n5. Get a rickshaw and go to the State Bank of India which is very near by. If a rickshaw is not available, the bank is in walking distance.\n6. Pay ₹1050 (or the asked fee) at the State Bank of India\n7. Get an ink stamp on form from bank\n8. Take your copies, your payment slip and your forms back to the Prohibition and Excise Department.\n9. The Department office will provide you with form F.L. /A-1. Fill out form and ask for more than the maximum allowed (ask for about 6 units) to ensure you get the maximum.\n10. Pay ₹2 at the Department office. Receive two stamps which are to be stuck onto get form F.L. / A-1 form to show you have paid.\n\nYou will either be able to pick up the license immediately, or in a few days. Once you have your licence, you take it to a large hotel where they have an alcohol shop, and make your purchases.\n\nBootlegging is rampant, but it carries a risk as well. Decent brands of Indian whisky start around ₹200 as do rum, vodka and gin. Premium brands range from ₹600 to ₹1,800 for 12-year-old Scotch. It is difficult to find beer, wine, champagne and imported spirits.\n\nBooze is strictly a private affair and don't expect to order a drink at a restaurant, and there are no pubs or bars, and you will have to drink in your hotel room or at someone's home. If someone invites you to a party, there is a good chance you will be offered a drink there. Under a new amendment to the law prohibiting alcohol, you cannot be arrested or detained for consuming alcohol illegally unless you misbehave under influence or are bootlegging. However, it is best to consume alcohol at your hotel room or at a very close friends place. Consumption of alcohol in hotel rooms has implied consent from the hotel who will serve you ice, glasses and mixers.\n\nMany small shops sell lassi, a yogurt drink. Lassi choices include: sweet, salty, with almonds. Farki, Girish Cold Drinks and Krishna Dairy are some of the famous ones. Apart from this, Janta Ice Cream and Cold Drinks offers a delicious drink cold Chocolate Coco, a chocolate flavoured thick shake. Janta has its shops across Ahmedabad. There is also a very wide variety of fruit juices available. Most large places like Havmor are reputable and use good water, but you should exercise care when drinking at smaller places.\n\n== Sleep ==\n\nCheaper hotels are available on the eastern side of the Sabarmati in the old town area.\n\nMore expensive and newer hotels are available in the more affluent Navrangpura area.\n\nIn case you don't have an idea where to go when you arrive to the city, you could ask a rickshaw driver to take you to Relief Road which has plenty of budget accommodation available and is pretty close to the main train station.\n\n==Connect==\nInternational code for India is +91\nThe local area code is 79. Thus in total, +91 79 must be prefixed to a phone number.\n\n===Buy pre-paid SIM===\nTo buy a SIM card foreign nationals need to provide a photocopy of their passport, Indian visa page, a passport-sized photo and a proof of residence in India. As with much in India, the associated bureaucracy can be slow and frustrated. Activation of a SIM card can take a number of days.\n\nThe top mobile phone networks in India are:\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Emergency information===\n* Emergency Help (at any time) - '''108'''\n* Police - 100\n* Fire - 101\n* Ambulance - 102 / 108\n* Airport Inquiry - 141\n* Railways I.V.R.S. - 139\n* Railways General Enquiry - 131\n* Telephone Directory Inquiry - 197\n* Telephone Local Assistance - 199\n\n==Cope==\nThe railway reservation office, and tourist booking window, are in an air conditioned building just outside and to the right (when looking from the street) of the Kalupur Railway station. Other railways stations are able to book tourist quota, but often refuse to serve you and refer you to Kalupur Railway station after a lengthy wait.\n\n*'''Canada and United States Visa Facilitation Centre''' Gujarat Chambers Building, Shri Ambika Mills, Ashram Road (Ellis Bridge)\n\n===Hospitals===\nFor medical emergencies, dial '''108'''.\n\n* \n\nThe main Apollo Hospital is in the twin city of Gandhinagar, but very close to the airport.

Gyan Vani (104.5&amp;nbsp;MHz) is an educational FM radio station run under media co-operation model.\n\n==Stay safe==\nPeople are friendly and the police will help you when you have an emergency. Ahmedabad is relatively safe because alcohol is not permitted: no late-night rowdyism as seen in other cities.\n\n===Police stations===\n'''[http://www.ahmedabadcitypolice.org/ Ahmedabad City Police]''' has around 35 major police stations besides the minor police chowkis.\n\nFor emergency, dial '''100'''.\n\n'''[http://ahmedabadcitypolice.org/police-stations/ Find your police station]''' depending on the area.

The lake attracts a large variety of birds like plovers, sandpipers, stints, cormorants, grebes and openbill storks among others. The best season to visit the sanctuary is November to February.\n* '''Thol Bird Sanctuary''' This sanctuary is about 30&amp;nbsp;km west of the city centre. Just as Nal Sarovar, this lake attracts a large variety of bird species. It has become more preferable for the amdavadis to take an early morning trip. Although it does not have any facilities like boating, it has turned out more favourable as this is a lesser known place. It will be best to rent a taxi for a morning as there is no public transport available here. November to March is the best time to visit.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The Shinano provides connections from Nagano and Matsumoto, the Hida limited express runs from Toyama and Takayama, the Nanki runs from Shingu and Mie|Mie Prefecture, and the Shirasagi allows those in Kanazawa and Fukui to get to Aichi faster. All of the above lines are covered by the JR Rail Pass.\n\nThe only private railway that provides access to Aichi is Kintetsu Railway. Kintetsu serves much of the Kansai area. It is only likely to be the fastest option if you want to reach Aichi from Mie or certain parts of Nara (prefecture)|Nara, but also connects to Osaka.\n\n===By bus===\nAs one of Japan's largest cities, the many highway buses coming in and out of Nagoya make Aichi very accessible by bus from many faraway places, some of which take a lot of time and money to reach by train. There are direct buses to/from Nagoya from Sendai, Fukushima, Koriyama, Utsunomiya, Tokyo, Kofu, Fujiyoshida, Nagano, Matsumoto, Ina, Iida, Niigata, Toyama, Takaoka, Kanazawa, Fukui, Shirakawa-go, Takayama, Kyoto, Osaka, Nara, Kobe,  Okayama, Kurashiki, Takamatsu, Tokushima, Matsuyama, and Fukuoka.\n\n==Get around==\n\nUsing train for transportation is common in Aichi. The major railways are Meitetsu (aka Nagoya Railroad, 名古屋鉄道), JR Central (aka JR Tōkai, JR東海), and the Aichi Loop Railway (aka Aikan, 愛知環状鉄道). JR Central's subsidiary Tōkai Transport Service also runs the only non-electrified line in the prefecture, the Jōhoku Line (東海交通事業城北線).\n\nJR Central's Chuo and Tokaido Lines connect the major cities. For smaller towns, the Meitetsu and Aikan lines may prove convenient. The city of Nagoya also has a municipal subway, with some lines providing through service with Meitetsu lines.\n\n==See==\n]]\n\n* See one of the oldest remaining castles in Japan (Inuyama)\n* Discover two of Japan's \"Six Kilns\" (Seto and Tokoname)\n* Learn about the past, present, and future of railway travel and technology at the SCMaglev Railway Museum (Nagoya)\n* Marvel at the hundreds of fox statues at Toyokawa Inari (Toyokawa)\n* Explore the grounds of Nagoya Castle, one of the original great castles of Japan (Nagoya)\n* Learn about the history of Toyota and see a variety of old and new car models (Toyota)\n* Pray at Atsuta Shrine, mentioned in the ''Kojiki'' and home of one of the National Regalia (Nagoya)\n* See Tokugawa Ieyasu's old stomping grounds (Okazaki)\n* Reminisce in the old 2005 Expo Park (Nagakute)\n\n==Do==\n\n==Eat==\n\nAichi is famous for wikipedia:Nagoya_cuisine|Nagoya cuisine, and particularly its \"miso (味噌) culture\".

Aihole was the first capital of the Chalukya Kings. It had a school of temple architecture where artisans used to learn the craft of temple building and sculpture. Consequently, Aihole has hundreds of temples in villages and fields nearby. The architecture of these temples will enthrall you. \n\n==Get in==\n===By car===\nThe nearest town to Aihole is Badami, 40 minute away by road . Bagalkote is 47 km from Aihole.

Many trains going to Bagalkote ( Station code: BGK ) from Hubbali and Bengaluru do have a stop at Badami. Mumbai CSMT to Gadag super fast express ( 11139/11140) via Pune has a stop at Bagalkot railway station.\n\n===By plane===\nHubli-Dharwad|Hubli (Hubbali) airport is the nearest airport. \n\n\n==Get around==\nAihole is a small place; all destinations can be explored by foot. The temples are scattered all over the Aihole village. Autorickshaw ( three wheel  passenger vehicle )  can be used  to commute if you cannot walk for long time or distance. The roads to temples are very narrow so big vehicles may find it difficult to manoeuvre. \n\n==See==\nImage:LadKhanTempleAihole.JPG|thumb|350px|Ladkhan temple, Aihole\n\nBear in mind that this was a school of temple architecture, so you will see temples built in different styles. An artisan was taught to move progressively from simple to more complex forms of sculpture (as seen on pillars in the Durga Temple). Yellow sandstone is a relatively soft material and easy to carve on. Hence this was used as the material here.\n\nUnlike most Indian temples, the names of the temples in Aihole do not reflect the deities placed inside. When the British stumbled upon these temples, they were inhabited by local villagers who were using these as shelter. So some of the names reflect the residents at the time, others describe their location, and so on.\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Do==\nImage:AiholePattadakalRoad.JPG|thumb|350px|Aihole Landscape\n==Buy==\n\n==Eat==\n\nPlease pack food for your trip as there are no restaurants in Aihole.

                    "text": "\n'''Ailsa Craig''' (Gaelic: ''Creag Ealasaid'') is an uninhabited island in the Firth of Clyde, 9 miles off the coast of Ayrshire. It measures about 3⁄4 of a mile north-south by ½ a mile east-west, and rises abruptly to 1120 ft (340 m). Its distinctive pyramid can be seen from afar in good weather. It's nowadays a birdlife reserve, though its granite is still quarried to make curling stones. \n\n== Understand ==\n\nAilsa Craig is a pluton, a volcanic upwelling from about 60 million years ago, along with similar hills on the nearby island of Arran. Typically a pluton has no erupting volcano, but magma wells up and shoulders aside pre-existing rock. It then cools very slowly into coarse-grained granite that is hard-wearing, so it persists long after surrounding features have eroded away. Plutons have formed throughout Earth's existence and this one arose in the Palaeogene, formerly called the Early Tertiary. In that period the continents came close to their present positions, the global climate cooled, and dinosaurs suffered mass extinction to be replaced by mammals. Then followed the ice ages, which scraped and polished the surface of Ailsa Craig, and transported boulders from it as far away as Pembroke and Donegal. Any Stone Age person stranded amid the frozen wastes would be sure to think: \"Hey, what a colossal ice rink and helluva curling stone\".\n\nThe island has fresh water but almost no topsoil, and it's a long way to bring sheep for grazing, so only intermittently was it inhabited. Around 1400 it was owned by the Cluniac monks of Crossraguel, and has been a bolthole for fugitives and landing-beach for fishermen and pirates. It's always been a nesting place for seabirds and stop-off for migratory flocks: the solan geese were hunted into modern times. Yet this remote spot once had a gasworks and two railways. \n\nFrom the mid-19th century Ailsa Craig was quarried for its distinctive granite \"Ailsite\", a form of riebeckite (formula Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)Si&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, since you were wondering). The floor of the Chapel of the Thistle in St Giles Cathedral Edinburgh is an example of Ailsite granite. The railways - really just wagon haulways - were built then, and the visiting freighters brought rats, which set about the island bird population. A lighthouse was built by the Stevensons in 1886, and automated in 1990, when its keepers the last island residents left. Ailsa Craig has no safe all-weather harbour and the quarry was unprofitable for mass extraction of building stone, but found a niche use as a source of curling stones. \n\nCurling is the sport of sliding stone bowls over ice towards a target area, and the curl is induced by the spin of the bowl as it travels, offset by brushing the ice to speed and straighten its path. Curling emerged in the 16th century in Scotland and the Netherlands;  it's not agreed which was first, but both had freezing cold winters and strong trading links. At first, any hefty flat-based stone would serve, then the sport was regularised and a handle became standard. Ailsa Craig is the traditional source, fashioned into stones by Kays in Mauchline near Ayr. Trefor quarry on the Llŷn Peninsula in Wales exports stone to the Canada Curling Company. The stone has a concave base, so all the contact with the ice is on its rim. The ice is not flat but \"pebbled\" by frozen droplets of water for a faster running surface. This means that the contact is highly concentrated, so a completely impervious stone is necessary, otherwise water would be forced in at microscopic level, would then freeze and crack the structure, and the stone would soon become pitted and unusable. Kays only quarry once every few years, taking 2000-ton batches of three Ailsite varieties (green, blue, and a little bit of red) back to the mainland for storage until required for manufacture. These amounts aren't going to diminish the island any time soon. \n\nThe island is now a bird sanctuary managed by the [http://www.rspb.org.uk/ Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB)]. In 1991 the rats were eradicated by poison: they had been especially damaging to puffins, which nest in easily accessible burrows, where eggs and chicks are unguarded while the adults fish. The rabbits are also an introduced species but are much less damaging and their presence is tolerated. Puffins soon re-colonised the island, and all species showed a rebound in numbers.\n\n== Get in ==\n\nThere are no scheduled ferries, and most visitors get here on a boat trip. Most trips are non-landing, circumnavigating to view the wildlife.  Ailsa Craig is also within sea-kayaking range, but you're nine miles out, think about the changing conditions and the getting back. \n\nGirvan is the usual point of departure for trips, see that page for details. McCrindle the main boat operator advertises year-round sailings. In reality, the weather and lack of customers make trips unlikely in winter.\n\nCruises of the west coast and Hebrides sometimes approach Ailsa Craig. One example is the [http://www.waverleyexcursions.co.uk/ ''Waverley''], the world's last sea-going paddle steamer, which ranges around the Firth of Clyde in summer. This elderly vessel has had long spells hospitalised for repair, and it's a wonder she keeps going.\n\nThe landing jetty on Ailsa Craig is on the sheltered east side, just north of the lighthouse.\n\n== Get around ==\n \nWalk everywhere. You need stout boots.\n\n== See ==\n* '''The railway''' ascends from the landing area to a winding station, then forks to the lighthouse or to the gasworks. It's 3-foot gauge, with the initial gradient cable-hauled and the upper sections worked by horse or hand. The gasworks stand in what had been a kailyard, with a stone wall to keep goats off the crops. Until 1911 coal-gas was made to power the lighthouse and the compressors which piped air to the island's north and south foghorns - some stretches of pipeline remain. Foghorns were discontinued in 1987. \n*  was completed in 1886. It's near the landing jetty on the only stretch of flat land, so it can be seen from the Ayrshire coast and inshore channel, but not from out in the Irish Sea. It used oil- then gas-burning lamps, which in 1911 were replaced by incandescent lighting. It was connected by telegraph in 1935: until then the keepers relied on carrier pigeons. On stormy nights when pigeons couldn't fly, urgent messages (for instance to send a doctor) were indicated by signal fires. The lighthouse remains active: it was automated in 1990 and converted to solar power in 2001. Attempts to sell off the keepers' cottage for exclusive accommodation have so far come to nothing, as has a far-fetched plan to develop an outpost of Trump Turnberry Resort here.\n* '''The quarry railway''' is now only marked by a trackbed round the south end of the island. It was a fairly basic horse-drawn haulway for tubs of stone. \n*  is a typical Borders turret of circa 1500 that finds itself somehow marooned here. It was refurbished in the 1580s when war with Spain was expected. In the event, a string of calamities drove the 1588 Spanish Armada right around the tip of Scotland to the Atlantic coast, but none of the stricken ships tried to land here. There were attempts to use the island as a bolthole for Catholic fugitives of persecution (which didn't end well for the Catholics) and as a forward base for another Spanish incursion (likewise a fiasco played out elsewhere). The castle ruins stand 39 ft (12 m) tall, approached by the steep path towards the summit.\n*  marks the island summit, with breezy views west towards Mull of Kintyre (with Sanda Island just off it) and the Antrim coast (with Rathlin island just north).\n\n== Do ==\n\n'''Wildlife spotting:''' the skies are especially full of sea birds during the nesting season of spring and early summer.\n\n== Eat and drink ==\n\nBring everything you need with you, as there is no food or drink on the island.\n\n== Sleep ==\n\nThere is no accommodation on the island, and camping is not permitted.\n\n== Stay safe ==\nBoat trips are generally open or only partly covered, so you need warm, windproof and waterproof clothing, at any time of year. \n\nThe cliffs are dangerous and the ground nearby is often slippery from drizzle and bird-poo.\n\n== Connect ==\n\nAs of Oct 2022, the island has no mobile signal. Consider leaving your phone somewhere safe ashore, rather than risk a soaking or breakage in a stumble.\n\n== Go next ==\n* Girvan is probably where your boat trip will return you. It retains its character as a fishing village rather than a \"Costa Clyde\" beach resort.\n* Ayr (Scotland) | Ayr is particularly associated with the poet Robert Burns, who grew up in Alloway 3 miles south. A further six miles south near Maybole is the ruin of Crossraguel Abbey, which once owned Ailsa Craig.\n* Mauchline 12 miles east of Ayr is the home of Kay's, whose curling stones are sold world wide - reckon £300 for a new one, but you need a set, and think about the cost of postage. Robert Burns farmed awhiles unprofitably at Mauchline, as he did at Maybole and Tarbolton, but the only mementoes of those times are plaques and graves of his boozing companions and lovers.\n\n\n\n\n"

                    "text": "\nTravelling as an '''air courier''' was a way to get cheap air-fare by giving up most or all of your luggage allowance.  You generally had to organize ahead of time, but sometimes, last-minute deals were available. As a means of delivering urgent parcels and freight, splitting the checked baggage allowance from a passenger ticket in this manner is in decline. A handful of air courier assignments still exist, such as [https://www.aircharterservice.com/cargo-charter/on-board-courier/become-an-onboard-courier Air Charter Service], but there are few bargains to be had.\n\nIncreasingly, parcel carriers are deploying their own cargo-only air fleets. As airlines improve their own cargo operations to shorten delivery time, the need for urgent packages to travel as checked passenger baggage is disappearing. Heightened security post-September 11, 2001 is also a factor in the decline of air courier travel.\n\n==How it worked==\nCourier companies are well paid for delivering things quickly. Frequently, time is very important with business documents, merchandise or spare parts for an urgent repair. On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller firms there was a problem. If they sent things by air freight, on some routes it may have taken days to get through unloading and customs. The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked luggage. Airline regulations will not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.\n\nCourier companies routinely booked one seat each way, every day on flights between two major business hubs, for example from New York to Hong Kong. These are always economy class, generally on major airlines, and usually a flight that departs in the evening. Of course, the airlines give them a very good price.\n\nYou can occupy that seat at a discount, provided you accompany their stuff. A courier representative will meet you at the airport with your ticket, the shipment (which is checked in for you) and the shipping documents (which you carry). Another rep will meet you at the other end to take delivery. You just deliver the documents, and they do the rest.  In no case, do you have to help with carrying their luggage load. \n\nSometimes, someone will also meet you in the middle, e.g. on a Sydney-London courier flight, you stop in Tokyo, where you drop off the Sydney-Tokyo stuff and pick up Tokyo-London.\n\nDiscounts were often substantial, 20% and up, although this gap has narrowed with the increasing prevalence of discounted tickets from other sources. Once the company knew you as a regular and reliable courier, deals sometimes got even better. If someone cancelled and they were stuck, they occasionally offered a last-minute free flight.  In other words, someone else paid dearly for your free trip!\n\nA few years back, courier travel was possible within North America or Europe. That has been eliminated by air express companies such as FedEx and DHL which have their own planes or long-term contracts with the airlines.  \n\nNowadays, the few remaining courier flights are almost all intercontinental, and are diminishing in number for various reasons — tighter airside security, more business documents transmitted on-line instead of hand-carried, better efforts by airlines to co-operate efficiently with cargo firms. In rare instances, FedEx may still have a passenger hand-carry a courier package on a commercial flight as a premium service with [http://customcritical.fedex.com/us/services/air-expedite/courier.shtml end-to-end tracking], but this is becoming an uncommon, last-resort option as cargo-only flights are increasingly operated by parcel companies using their own aircraft.\n\n== Restrictions ==\n\nCourier travel was not for everyone, as there are serious restrictions:\n\n* Destinations were limited to major business routes. If you didn't live near a major international airport, that was your problem.  A few courier companies might have sold connecting tickets, but you'd have paid the difference and expected ''long'' layovers to avoid any chance of missing the main flight.\n* Your luggage is severely limited. Some companies allowed one checked bag. With most, you flew with carry-on luggage only. Occasionally, one may have had a full luggage allowance on the return trip only. That meant buying new luggage or a large, sturdy box at the destination.  Of course, this baggage was subject to customs duty when you arrive back home, so it wasn't a good idea to overdo it.\n* You needed to book well in advance for popular routes or seasons.\n* You paid the fare, or at least a deposit, at time of booking.\n* Most courier tickets were for a round trip, usually with a stay between 7 and 30 days.\n* If you cancelled close to your flight time, there would be no refund.\n* Visas, if required,  were your responsibility.  However, countries which required a visa ''solely'' because you're a courier were few in number (if any).\n* You needed to report to immigration and customs at your destination that you flew as a courier.  There was nothing at all unusual about this, as they encountered it every day.\n* The courier companies booked a daily flight with one airline, months in advance. You could not change anything &amp;mdash; airline, route or even flight.\n* You may or may not be able to get reward miles for the trip.\n* If you wanted to travel with a friend (both having courier fares), each needed to travel on a different day or for a different company.\n\nIf you cannot live with these restrictions, see the Air travel on a budget article for other options, such as charter flights or airline consolidators.  Fares will likely be a little higher, but there is more flexibility.\n\nBooking through an agency was generally worth the small fee of joining the agency, as they are given most access to the flights. They may be able to offer flights that you could not find as a freelance courier.\n\n==Demise==\nNot very long ago, taking a position as a commercial airline courier was an attractive way to travel on a small allowance. You essentially were contacted to transport a parcel from one city to another and your carry-on baggage allocation was “rented.” You were then rewarded with a low fare for the trip. This type of agreement isn’t as prevalent anymore, due to the fact that companies don’t rely on couriers as much as they used to, because air shipping is faster than it ever was before.\n\nThese days, few companies can offer someone the chance to serve as a courier. Although in the 1970s one would pay a token passage as a courier, by the 2010s, courier passengers barely saved 15 to 50% off the full ticket price. These types of ticket prices are regularly sold to the general public by other means, such as seat sales.\n\nAs individual routes disappear (either through airlines improving their cargo operations or courier companies flying their own cargo-only flights), many of the agencies which provided lists of available flights have gone off-line and many popular beaten-path destinations are no longer available. The few seats which remain available may be going to some rather out-of-the-way points as there are plenty of other means to get an urgent package from (for example) London to New York.\n\n==Stay safe==\nIf you prepay any money for participation as a commercial airline envoy, you are being given the run around. \n\nYou need to be very careful about the legitimacy of the jobs you take.  The last thing you want is to be caught transporting contraband (or worse) on a plane. A good way to avoid this is to use an agent (usually a representative of the service you are working for), who will take you through customs and clear the contents.  Always check the reputation of the courier company before booking. None which are reliable and legitimate would ever try to ship anything hazardous or illegal.\n\nIf you do decide to become a courier, you won’t receive many options in where you can travel. You go to whatever location they need you to visit, whether it is the Middle East, North America or another location. You obtain a last minute permit for the trip and are oftentimes restricted as to the number of bags you are approved to have with you. Chances are, you will get better discounts by finding reasonably priced flights using other means.\n\n\n\n\n"

                "revision": {
                    "text": "\n\n'''Airlie Beach''' (or Airlie) is a town in Queensland, Australia and is the closest port from which to access the Whitsunday islands on the Great Barrier Reef. With around 25,000 residents, it is developed to cater for almost every kind of tourist and backpacker, and is the major hub for trips out to the Whitsunday islands and Outer Great Barrier Reef.\n\n[http://www.abelpointmarina.com.au/ Abel point marina] is the location for taking boats out to islands, and is a brisk 15-minute walk from Shute Harbour Road, Airlie's High Street, around a renovated seaside boardwalk.\n\n==Understand==\n\nAirlie beach used to be a backpacker haven but has now been discovered by Australians and has consequently become more commercialised. Still plenty of good cheap accommodation and an excellent stop off on the East Coast of Australia.\n\n===Orientation===\n\nThe main strip of Airlie where most of the backpacker resorts and pubs are is usually known as Airlie Beach proper.  Cannonvale is the section west of the strip to where the developments peter out. Beyond that is Cannonvalley and Strathdickie - more rural areas where the housing is more acreage style or farming land. Other suburbs in the area are Jubilee Pocket and Shute Harbour, where the ferries to the Whitsunday Islands depart from.\n\n==Get in==\n\n\n===By plane===\nFlying to Proserpine Airport, also known as Whitsunday Coast Airport, in Proserpine is the easiest way to reach Airlie. The two main airlines flying to here are [http://www.virginaustralia.com Virgin Australia] and [http://www.jetstar.com.au Jetstar]. It has upgraded facilities with full baggage collection, hire car and service desks and a small bistro area.\n\nThere is also Hamilton Island airport which is just off Airlie Beach. Do your research though as you have to get off Hamilton Island and this could be expensive.\n\n===By train===\nThere is a train station in Proserpine for those travelling up the East Coast.\n\n===By bus===\n[http://www.greyhound.com.au/ Greyhound] and [https://www.premierms.com.au/ Premier] coaches stop at Airlie on their trip between Brisbane and Cairns.\n\nThere are also tours that travel up the East Coast and visit Airlie Beach.\n\nHitchHiking is rare but it can be efficient.\n\n==Get around==\n\nA number of buses serve the airport terminal, and drive to Airlie beach or other locations but all but one must be prebooked. The tickets cost a flat $15 per person one way and can be purchased in a queue at a clearly marked booth just inside the arrival gate. The bus driver mans the booth, and when everyone has got a ticket (about 30–40&amp;nbsp;minutes wait from arrival) the bus gets going. Another option is to take a taxi, for which there is also a booth inside the arrivals gate. However taxi rides seem to match the bus price, and cost $15 per person. Also, there may not be any taxis waiting. The ride to Airlie beach is smooth and takes about 40&amp;nbsp;minutes. The driver will ask where you are staying and take you to the door of the hostel or hotel in Airlie Beach.\n\n==See==\n\n==Do==\n\nOn Saturday morning there is a charming market along the waterfront, with a range of locally produced foods and souvenirs.\n\n===Swimming===\n\nDespite its name, Airlie Beach is not the best place for the beach. The few near Shute Harbour Rd are small and pretty, but the presence of jellyfish (there are signs up detailing different species near the beaches) means people do not swim in the water from around October to around May. There is a new man made beach Port of Airlie which has a larger beach than Airlie beach proper and it also has a shopping area and boat marina. A swim in the water requires a stinger suit - made from rash top type material. However more than making up for this, Airlie has a fantastic man made lagoon. This is around 200 m long and 50 m wide, landscaped with a bridge and grass to lie on surrounding. It is watched by lifeguards during the day and security at night, and because it is open to swim in at all times the lagoon makes relaxing in Airlie pure delight.\n\n===Day trips===\n\nTransfers to cruises and daytrips to the Whitsunday Islands and Outer Great Barrier Reef are popular in Airlie.  See the Whitsunday Islands for information.\n\n===Hiking===\n\nAirlie Beach features several hiking trails of different length. One starts at the end of  and leads in about 90 minutes up through the national park to a beautiful lookout over the harbour and the Whitsunday Islands.\n\n==Eat==\nAirlie has many varied restaurants, both budget and more expensive, and a range of takeaway places with specials catering to the backpacker market.\n\nFor those foodies out there, Deja Vu at Water's Edge Resort is beautiful and Capers at the Airlie Beach Hotel is always reliable.\n\nFor those on a budget, Morocco's, Beaches or Magnums offer good pub-style meals, with some of the sailing trips offering meals there included as part of the trip cost.\n\n==Drink==\nAirlie has a great nightlife with bars concentrated on the main road.\n\n* \n\n==Sleep==\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Connect==\nHostels and hotels provide internet access, some for free but most at a cost of a few dollars per hour or day. You can also check 'The Whitsunday Central Reservation Centre' at the end of main Street Airlie Beach ($1 for 30 min; 30 min free if you're using AI's Laundry opposite the road). Peterpans travel agency on the main street provide Wi-Fi, computers and a printer. McDonald's offers free Wi-Fi.\n\n* \n\n==Go next==\n\nFor those with access to a car and don't mind a bit of a hike, a trip to '''Cedar Creek Falls''' is well worth it. '''Dingo Beach''' and '''Hideaway Bay''' are also within 30&amp;nbsp;minutes drive, and the quaint restaurants are a quiet break away from the younger crowd.  Quad biking and horse riding are also other options for something to do in Airlie.\n\nAirlie Beach and Shute Harbour are access points to the Whitsunday Islands and cruises around them.\n\n\n\n"

                    "text": "\n\n'''Airline alliances''' are formed when different airlines agree to substantially cooperate with each other. Advantages for customers include more destinations and more convenient connections, while the airlines benefit by feeding passengers to each other instead of to competitors.\n\n== Understand ==\nFor travelers, the most obvious effect of airline alliances is codesharing whereby one airline will sell a seat on a flight with its own flight number, but the flight is performed by a different airline. (Note that not all airlines are part of an airline alliance, and not even all airlines within the same alliance do codeshares with each other.)\n\nAlthough many airlines in an alliance have subsidiaries, the subsidiaries are often not members of the alliance which the parents are part of.\n\n===How does this apply to me?===\n*Airline alliances tend to coordinate their flights to ease connections, flying intercontinental flights to each other's hubs, adjusting schedules and grouping one alliance's flights at a single terminal at large airports. They code-share and interline (transfer bags) with each other, so that you can travel to many more destinations on a single ticket sold by your local airline.\n\n*You can collect frequent flyer programme|frequent flyer miles when flying on an alliance partner airline. This means for example that a passenger with Qantas can claim mileage when flying with another OneWorld airline such as British Airways.\n\n*Additionally, status levels that you have on one airline are generally recognized by other airlines in the same alliance. For example, a 'Morning Calm' status with Korean Air will automatically give you 'Elite' status when flying with another airline in the SkyTeam alliance. Thus, you can check in at the Business Class counter, get priority luggage tags, getting emergency exit row seats assigned to you and priority boarding of the aircraft.\n\n*Travelers can take advantage of a round-the-world ticket, a ticket with the ability to stop at a few countries around the world for a relatively lower price.\n*If your trip is interrupted by a flight delay or cancellation and has a connecting flight that you will now miss due to the interruption, airline staff may rebook you on another airline's flight from the same alliance to minimize the delay in reaching your final destination. \n\n==Oneworld==\n\n\n'''[http://www.oneworld.com Oneworld]''' is the smallest alliance counting by the number of airlines. The member airlines are spread evenly around the world, so it is a workable option when planning a long multi-point trip such as for a round the world flight. It was the first alliance to introduce interlining e-tickets. \n\n===Members===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"100%\"\n!width=\"130\" | Airline || Country || Hubs || Frequent flyer&lt;br&gt;program || Lounges || IATA\n|-\n|Alaska Airlines\n|\n|Anchorage, Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles, Portland (Oregon)|Portland (OR), San Diego International Airport|San Diego, San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco, San Jose (California)|San Jose (CA), Seattle-Tacoma International Airport|Seattle-Tacoma.\n|Mileage Plan\n|Alaska Lounge\n|AS\n|-\n| American Airlines ||  || Charlotte, Chicago O'Hare International Airport|Chicago - O'Hare, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles, Miami International Airport|Miami, John F.

Although you may think it is intuitive to join the airline you fly most, you should be aware that privileges offered are often different and frequent flyer points may be more generous under a different airline in the same alliance. \n\nBy way of example, to reach Star Alliance ''Gold'' status (affording you priority wait listing and boarding, extra checked baggage allowance and use of lounges even when flying on any Star Alliance economy flight) requires only 20,000 miles in one year with Aegean Airlines' ''Miles&amp;Bonus'' program, but some other member programs require 50,000 or even 100,000 miles in a year to be flown before awarding ''Gold'' status.\n\n\n"

                    "text": "\n'''[http://www.aitutakitourism.com Aitutaki]''' (Aye-too-tah-ki) is an island in the Southern Cook Islands. Aitutaki lagoon and its islands are breathtakingly beautiful.  The classic picture postcard of small palm tree fringed tropical island, with shallow, warm turquoise waters, corals, tropical fish and blue skies is taken here. The lagoon is large, taking about an hour to cross in a boat. \n\n==Understand==\n\nIt is a 45-minute flight from the capital island of Rarotonga. Tourism facilities are well developed, but are still low key enough not to intrude on the nature of the island.\n\nIn 2016, it was home to about 1,700 people.\n\n=== Geography ===\n\nThe larger island is split into different villages, '''Vaipae''' &amp; '''Tau'tu''' are the largest and are located on the south east side of the island, '''Arutanga''' is often referred to as town and is on the south west side of the island. Arutanga has a center area for shopping, and the Telecom Office (also the Post Office), the Westpac Bank and the Bank of the Cook Islands are located here. Here you will also find the Blue Nun and Wharf. '''Amuri''' is a general term for the north end of the island which contains most of the tourist accommodations and less population. The other villages on the island are '''Uriea''', '''Rearea''', '''Rama''', '''Vaipeka''' and '''Nikaupara'''.\n\nThere are several smaller island in the lagoon '''Akaiami''' is a small, elongated islet at the opposite end of the lagoon from Aitutaki's main island around 20 minutes across the lagoon from Aitutaki.   Akaiami is remote, quiet, charming, unspoiled and surrounded by pristine turquoise lagoon and coral reef, and there is a small lodge there.  '''One Foot Island''' is a popular stopping spot for lagoon cruises.\n\n=== History ===\n\nDuring World War II, the island was host to American forces who outnumbered the local population of the island at the time.  The Americans built the airstrips which are still in use today.  The island was built to be the last point of defence in the Pacific, but Japanese advance was reversed and the island never saw action.  Some descendants of the American troops stationed there remain on the island.\n\nThe lagoon was a stopover point for the TEAL (later to become Air New Zealand) flying boats, which operated to between Tahiti, Fiji and New Zealand until 1960.  The remains of the wharf where visitors would disembark for a two hour stopover, often including a swim in lagoon is still in place today on the island of ''Akaiami'' in the lagoon.  The rocks are slightly submerged.\n\n==Get in==\n\n=== By plane ===\nImage:Aitutaki-Motu Tapuaetai.jpg|thumb|right|350px|One Foot Island beach\n*  | url=http://www.cookislandsairports.com/ | email=\n| address= | lat=-18.830833 | long=-159.764167 | directions=\n| phone= | tollfree=\n| hours= | price=\n| wikipedia=Aitutaki Airport | wikidata=Q4699354\n| content=It is served by [http://www.airraro.co.ck Air Rarotonga] with daily flights from Rarotonga. There are flights three to five times daily (except Sundays where two flights are operated) that take approximately 45 minutes. There is a small cafe at the airport, selling Atiu coffee and some other local produce. There is no ATM at the airport. Flights are $200–250 each way, and the morning flights there and the afternoon flights back are be reserved for people doing day or overnight trips. It is possible to do a day trip from Rarotonga, which includes flights, a bus tour of the island, a lagoon cruise, and lunch. Regular price is $499, but lookout for last-minute specials down to $400.\n}}\n\n==Get around==\nAkaiami is a small, elongated islet at the opposite end of the lagoon from Aitutaki's main island. A boat ride of approximately 20 minutes communicates both island. In 2006, there was only one inhabitant to the island (Pare), whose family owned the island and ran a small lodge. Akaiami offers little in terms of entertainment, other than hiking, fishing, swimming and kayaking. Its remote location, far from tourists and technology, is the real asset of this small charming island. Akaiami is essentially a fairly remote, quiet, charming, unspoiled islet surrounded by a pristine turquoise lagoon and a coral reef.\n\n===By car/scooter===\n\nCar and Scooter (or Moped) hire are the main forms of transport on Aitutaki. This can easily be arranged through any of the rental companies (or better accommodations) on the island. Prices tend to be higher and quality a bit lower than on Rarotonga.\n\nA driver's licence costs $2.50 and can be purchased at the police station in Arutanga (also known as town). You will need to present your foreign driver's licence to obtain this. You are not required to have a motorcycle licence on your licence from your home country to obtain a licence for scooters &amp; motorcycles in the Cook Islands; driving down to the police station is typically your practicum, although very rarely they do short tests. The licence is paper with no photo identification and lasts for a year. An Aitutaki driver's licence is cheaper, easier to get, and faster than getting a licence in Rarotonga and your Aitutaki licence will cover you for the whole Cook Islands. Licences in Rarotonga cost $20 with an additional amount for a practical test. There are sometimes lines in Rarotonga at the licence office so if you can avoid it, and you don't want a laminated photo id, the Aitutaki licence is the way to go.\n\nPrices for cars can vary on which model chosen and which company used but typically $65 to $85 a day is usual with a refundable $40 petrol deposit. Cars typically tend to be automatics and are pretty reliable under the hood but will usually have some superficial damage.\n\nScooters are much more economical at $25 a day with a $10 petrol deposit. There is some competition with scooters so if you are not happy with yours you have other options. As with the cars, the scooters are typically in good condition and safe to drive, but will not be vespas or straight out of the box. Typically rentals are automatic, but ask and manuals should be available. Manual scooters can be in better condition because they are not rented as often.\n\n===By taxi===\n\nTaxis are expensive on Aitutaki. Rates are based on how far you are going, anywhere from NZ$10 per person for short trips to $20 per person, booking ahead is highly recommended and you can confirm your price then. There two taxi companies on the island (some restaurants &amp; bars will have their own vehicles for pickups) :\n\n* '''Pacifica Taxi''' - excellent service and reliable.\n* '''Tropicool Tours''' - as the name suggests, does day tours around the island, transfers for Lagoon Cruises, and transfers for Cafe Tupuna. It is operated by Nane Herman who is a wonderful resource on island life and usually arrives with flowers for her guests, the only problem is that she can have limited availability for taxi services.\n\n==See==\n\nImage:Aitutaki Lagune.JPG|thumb|right|The Lagune of Aitutaki, seen from Samade Beach\n\n* '''One-Foot Island''' is a must see with blue lagoons and white sandy beach. There is a post office (box), one of the most remote in the world.  There are beaches for swimming, you can walk around the island.  Best snorkelling seems to be around the island past the rock ledge, towards the reef.\n\nAitutaki Lagoon Resort &amp; Spa located on its own private island Akitua which is directly on the fabled Aitutaki Lagoon offering the best views from the Flying Boat Beach Bar &amp; Grill.  Day passes available for visitors not staying at the resort that allow access to water sports equipment, activities, beaches, bars, restaurant and Spa Polynesia.  Romantic Candlelit dining with degustation menu in the evening on the beach.\n\n* Take an island, safari, &amp; walk about '''tours'''\n* \n\n===Lagoon tours===\n\nIf the weather is nice, or even if it's not too bad, a lagoon cruise is near idyllic.  Aitutaki's lagoon is supposed to rival Bora Bora in French Polynesia for beauty, and all of the lagoon operators are reputable and offer excellent trips. There is not a best operator on Aitutaki for Lagoon Cruises so look around and decide what kind of a cruise you are looking for - smaller more intimate cruises which stay away from One Foot Island during peak periods, or larger slower boats with entertainment and toilets on board. Unless it's a terrible day you can't go wrong.\n\nFor those that prefer to \"do their own thing\" another way to enjoy the Aitutaki Lagoon is to hire a kayak or outrigger canoe from the Aitutaki Lagoon Resort &amp; Spa and paddle out to the nearest islet \"motu\" a few hundred metres away and go as far as is comfortable exploring the uninhabited islands.  Book a picnic lunch and find your own beach without another soul on it.\n\nFor cruises on a '''smaller boat''' try:\n\n* \n* \n\n==Do==\n\n\n\n* \n* '''Scuba diving''' is available\n:* \n:* \n* '''Fishing''' (either game fishing or fly fishing inside the lagoon). There is a game fishing area by the Wharf in Arutanga where the public can compete in Fishing Contests.\n* '''Explore''' the island - rent a bicycle, scooter, or car and drive around the island. Don't be in a rush though as it won't take you long to get around the island. Take your time are enjoy the beaches, and taro on banana plantations. Of course the beach is also beckoning and the water is beautiful. The highest peak, Maunga Pu, offers good birds eye views of the whole island.\n* Experience an '''Island night'''\n\nThe Aitutaki Lagoon Resort &amp; Spa offers traditional drum dance show on Monday and Thursday nights featuring Aitutaki's best dancers. Dinner from 6:30PM and show begins at 8PM. All welcome. Bookings essential.\n\n* \n*\n\n==Buy==\n\nThere is a small store for supplies in town, and two ATMs.  The selection is very much what is available at the time, and is quite limited.  Sea cargo can arrive in Aitutaki every 3 months, and supplies can be limited before resupply.\n\nOn Sundays there is only one store open, the Neibaa Store in Vaipae, and there is only one petrol station next to the airport.\n\n==Eat==\n\n* Try the island's '''Ike mata''' (raw tuna) with coconut milk. It is delicious! And Poke a Cook Island Banana pudding which usually comes baked in the Earth oven or \"Umu\" Try not to eat snapper as they may give you ciguatera.\n\nReservations for dinner are a good idea on Aiutaki, as periodically the more popular restaurants will book up during tourist peak periods.\n\nThe Flying Boat Beach Bar &amp; Grill at Aitutaki Lagoon Resort &amp; Spa has views of Aitutaki Lagoon and offers Pacific cuisine between 11AM and 9PM. The Bounty Brasserie offers casual dining and regular live entertainment. Candlelit dining with a degustation menu and private waiter under the stars is available for a limited number of couples each evening.\n\n* \n* \n* \n\nThe following all serve decent quality food but it definitely leans more to a take away style menu, with hamburgers being a big staple.\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Drink==\n\nThe Flying Boat Beach Bar &amp; Grill at The Aitutaki Lagoon Resort &amp; Spa offers the best views of the fabled Aitutaki Lagoon as it is located directly on the lagoon on the private island of \"Akituta\". Enjoy a tropical cocktail as the sun goes down.\n\nPacific or Islands Nights are also a good option to experience while you are in the Cook Islands. Islands nights usually involve either a buffet or a la carte menu and an island dancing show for a set price. Most island nights will also include a string band before the show as well. While Cook Island dancing is distinct in its own ways and definitely worth watching, it will be of a same vein as Tahitian shows for those more familiar with French Polynesia.\n\nThere is also nightlife, particularly on Fridays &amp; Saturdays. The popular venues change every once in a while but are not typically hard to find and will usually be wherever the Island night takes place.\n\n* '''Samade's Bar''' tends to attract more tourists than locals. You will find locals genuinely friendly and open and it is an excellent experience. The only words of caution are that periodically fights can occur after closing among those who've had too much to drink. It can be village rivalry or personal but almost never involves tourists. Closing time is always midnight.\n*'''Coconut Crusher Bar'''.  A great feed, a great drink and wonderful people\n\n==Sleep==\n\n\n==== Budget ====\n\n* \n\n==== Mid-range ====\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==== Splurge ====\n\n*The Aitutaki Lagoon Resort &amp; Spa has its own private island, \"Akitua\", on Aitutaki Lagoon. Offers overwater bungalows, a Royal Honeymoon Pool Villa and beachfront bungalows. Dining options are covered in \"Eat\" above. Spa Polynesia offers therapists and a wide selection of spa treatments.\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Stay safe==\n\nIt will be a challenge, if not virtually impossible, to get into trouble in Aitutaki.\n\nWater is filtered but not UV treated, so you may want to drink bottled water whilst on the island. There is a communal water tank in town next to the market with safe water, and it has a tap from which you can fill up water bottles for free.\n\nThere are mosquitoes on the island, but there is no malaria. There are stone fish in the lagoon, so wear reef shoes when exploring the reef.\n\n==Connect==\nThere are hotspots from Bluesky and Zenbu scattered throughout the island. Bluesky also has a small store that is combined with the post office in Arutanga where you can buy vouchers, or just buy them online when connecting.\n* '''Spider Co. Internet Lounge''' - internet cafe\n* Internet access at the Boat Shed.\n* Wireless access (with your laptop) at Koru Cafe.\n\n==Go next==\n\nThe flying boats used on the coral route via Aitutaki are on display in Auckland#See|Auckland.\n\n\n\n\n"

Today, however, it is a small and mostly insignificant Romanian town, with not much to see, and only the central plaza reminding of its old atmosphere.\n\nHaving been founded by Germans in the 12th century, Aiud has later turned into a wealthy Hungarian town with its economy based on vine cultivation. With the foundation of a prestigious high school, it became a centre of education, and was dubbed \"the Leiden of Transylvania\". In 1849, Romanian troops and marauders massacred most of the inhabitants (who were predominantly Hungarian) and destroyed the entire town, including the school and churches.

                    "text": "\n\n'''[http://www.aixenprovencetourism.com/en/ Aix-en-Provence]''' (usually simply called Aix) is a small, classically Provence|Provençal town. It is famous for being the home of the artist Paul Cézanne. The arrival of the TGV (high-speed train) station has brought lots of vacationers from the north, and Aix has turned into a shopping town with high variety and representation considering its small size. Three universities and several French-language schools for international students produce a very strong student presence.\n\n==Understand==\n\n\nAix has always been a rich city. There is a high contrast between Marseille (only 30&amp;nbsp;km and half an hour away). Whereas Marseille is one the poorest French cities (but still a unique and not to be missed town), Aix is perhaps one of the richest. People seeking for budget or popular places should continue to Marseille. \n\nStill, Aix has a lot to offer. It is a quiet, clean and comfortable city. The city centre is mostly pedestrian and, though it is quite small (you can cross the centre in 15 minutes by foot), offers long hours of nice walks. As in all Provençal towns, the city centre consists of narrow streets, lined with interesting buildings from 17th-century hotels to paved plazas.\n\n* \n\n==Get in==\n\n===By train===\nAix has both a TGV and a regular station and is well-connected to the Paris—Marseille line and (via Marseille) to the Genoa—Nice—Barcelona line. \n* \n* \n\n===By bus===\n\n* \n\n* Nice &amp;ndash; [http://zou.maregionsud.fr Buses] from Care Routière Vauban in Nice (via Nice airport) go daily at 06:10 (not Sundays and holidays), 07:35, 09:25 (not Sundays and holidays), 12:00, and 17:15. They take about 3 hr 30 min and cost .\n\n===By plane===\nFly into Marseille or Nice. Marseille is nearer (just south), but budget airlines such as EasyJet prefer Nice. There is a navette (shuttle bus) that can take you from the airport to the bus station near the center of town.\n\n===By car===\nIf you come from anywhere up north you will most likely use the A7 motorway (''Route du Soleil'') that runs from Lyon to Marseille (whether you come from Switzerland or from the UK via Paris). At exit 27, take A8 (''La Provencale'') to Aix. From Spain, you'll take A9 (''La Languedocienne''), then turn onto A54 through the city of Arles (you might consider stopping there), then turn onto A7 and A8 respectively, as described above. From Italy, just take A8 passing Nice and all the posh Côte d'Azur resorts.\n\nAvoiding toll roads can be slow but highly pleasurable, many of the ''routes nationales'' offer wonderful scenery that motorways can't deliver (save maybe some parts of the A8 east of Nice).\n\nParking in Aix can be quite difficult. There is at least one free car park but allow plenty of time to find a space (and the spaces can be quite tight to get into!).\n\n==Get around==\nAix is a fairly small city and can be easily navigated by foot. Within the city centre, electric microbuses called [https://www.la-diabline.com/ La Diabline] provide service on 3 routes every 10 minutes (€0.60, Oct 2023). \n\nThe city bus system is also very efficient and has numerous stops within the city, and connects Aix with nearby villages, towns, and Marseille.  The city bus also runs to Carrefour Les Milles, a large shopping centre.  Discounted tickets for frequent bus users can be purchased at the main bus station.  The ticket office also sells discounted multi-pack tickets for the bus from Aix to Marseille and the TGV station (located between the two cities).\n\n==See==\n\n\n\n\nAix is famous for its fountains. The largest and the most popular one is on the Cours Mirabeau, the main avenue through town, as well as a moss-covered fountain which draws its water from a hot spring.\n\nAlong with searching out the dozens of fountains sprawled around the city, Aix is known for its architecture. The varied and often intricate doors are a key feature, as well as the bell towers. The bell towers throughout Aix-en-Provence, and Provence more generally, are made of wrought iron. This allows the strong winds of the Mistral to flow straight through them, since solid stone would be destroyed by the force of the winds.\n\nThe city market in Cours Mirabeau runs Tu Th Sa mornings (as of Oct 2023), but the largest and most colourful is the Saturday market which includes a flower market at the Place de l'Hotel de Ville and the main food market is at Place Richelme.\n\nIt has also become known as the home of Cézanne's later works. You can see his atelier with some of the original objects he painted into his still lives. The Bibémus Quarries allow you to see Mt. St. Victoire, the mountains he captured in many of his paintings. You can also visit the Manor of Jas de Bouffan which houses many of his masterpieces. To see all three, you need at least two days in Aix.\n\nAmong the main landmarks in the town are:\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \nfile:Aix-en-Provence Cathedrale Saint-Sauveur 1 20061227.jpg|thumb|Cathédrale Saint-Sauveur\n* \n* \n* \n* \n*\n*\n* \n*, free for under 26\n|lastedit=2023-03-23\n|content=Small museum dedicated to the history &amp; heritage of Aix.

At the #Understand|''tourist office'' you can learn about the more modern activities include bowling, billiards, pubs, etc.\n\nAnother option is to hire a bicycle (for about  for five hours) and ride around Aix. This is a very good way to see the town that is outside the center. You can find many interesting places and buildings that you wouldn't have seen other wise. Be careful though when riding in the centre of the town, since it is very crowded most of the time.\n\nThere is also a bus that leaves off the ''Fontaine de la Rotonde'' for  and you get there in ten minutes. Pack a lunch and put comfortable shoes on to do a nature walk or to climb the mountain. At the top there is a monastery where you can stay over night, make sure to bring fire wood.\n\nIf you have done too much walking, these [https://www.lescinemasaixois.com/ three cinemas] show some films in the original language (VO), just make sure you speak the language!\n\n==Learn==\nOne of the  is located in the town.\n\n==Buy==\n\nAix has many major fashion boutiques, as well as a plethora of small clothing stores, perfumeries, and touristy souvenir shops.  They are complemented by a few open-air markets in large squares, offering home made and grown goods and cafes.\n\nFor everyday items, look for various convenience stores, e.g., Monoprix (even on the Cours Mirabeau) with clothing and sundries at street level and a decent selection of groceries, and bottled beverages on the level below.\n\n==Eat==\n\nAix has an incredible number of restaurants compared to its small size. Most of them are gathered in a small area in the old city, between Place des Cardeurs and the Rotonde (Cours Mirabeau). Restaurants and bars on the Cours Mirabeau tend to be more expensive though, while some might be considered tourist traps, others are among the best places to eat in the city.\n\nYou can try ''Calissons'', a specialty of the region consisting of a smooth, pale yellow, homogeneous paste of candied fruit (especially melons and oranges) and ground almonds topped with a thin layer of royal icing. Calissons have a texture not unlike that of marzipan, but with a fruitier, distinctly melon-like flavour. Calissons are often almond-shaped and are typically about  in length.\n\n===Budget===\n\nAix en Provence is home to the Erasmus students' food of choice. If you really want to eat like a local and save a couple of euros, a great place to eat is the many corner restaurants that offer doner kebabs. For four euros you get a \"sandwich,\" wrapped in a galette or pita, that includes lettuce, tomatoes, onion, meat, French fries and be sure to ask for sauce blanche. This is very delicious and cheap. There are many restaurants that do their kebabs differently so be sure to try a few!\n\nIn combination with patisseries and bakeries, convenience stores (noted under \"Buy\" above) also offer good opportunities for economical self-catering, even for day visitors.\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* '''[http://pizza-capri.fr Porzione Capri]''' chain. The fact that many people in Aix say that Porzione Capri is the best pizza may let someone think that the Corsican Mafia, which owns the chain, has paid off the city to promote this place. It is simply well located and cheap. It's not bad but it's nothing to visit the city for so don't buy the hype and you'll enjoy it more.\n** \n** \n** \n\n===Mid-range===\n\n* \n*  (June 2015). It also has a courtyard in back.\n}}\n* \n* \n\n===Splurge===\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n==Drink==\n\nLike restaurants there are plenty of bars, pubs, night-clubs in Aix.\nA nice and relatively cheap place to have a drink is the  on Place de la Mairie.\n\nFor those who would like to meet with the local student population, the bar  might be a good choice. The prices are reasonable, and the ambiance is convivial: most of the regular customers are either tourists, or students. But be sure not to arrive too late, for the place may quickly be overcrowded, and you may have to drink your pint outside, without any chair or table!\n\n==Sleep==\n\n===Independent apartments===\n* \n\n===Budget===\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\nCampers should find a campground establishment, rather than camping alone in a forest for example, as the area surrounding this city is known to have wolves.\n\n===Mid-range===\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Splurge===\n\n==Connect==\nAs of July 2023, Aix and its surrounds have 5G from all French carriers.\n\n==Stay safe==\n\nAix is a safe city to visit, but crime does occur there. As with all French cities, tourists in Aix should be especially conscious of the risk of pickpockets and theft. Be aware of your surroundings. Do not leave valuables within view in parked cars. Exercise increased caution at night, and use the taxis that leave from the Rotonde fountain if you are returning to the outlying neighborhoods late in the evening. Avoid public parks after dark.\n\n==Cope==\n\n==Go next==\n* Arles\n* Avignon\n* Marseille\n* Nîmes\n\n\n\n"

They depart from various parts of the city, depending on the destination; the Guwahati-Silchar route starts at the Zarkawt area.\n\nAir India flies between Lengpui Airport and Kolkata and Guwahati.\n\n==Get around==\n\nAizawl is centred around a mountain ridge which means the roads run more or less parallel to the mountain side. This means if you need to go vertically up or down it will be faster to take a foot path than to go by road. The mountainous landscape also means that the cost of driving a relatively short horizontal distance can be quite expensive and this is reflected in bus and taxi rates.\n\nThere are numerous buses routes that connect the various localities and most run through the town centre (Dawrpui - North to South and Civil Hospital South to North). Bus fares vary and best is to ask the conductor, though a relatively short trip of 1 km cost around ₹5 (Jan 2012). One thing to note is that there are no buses operate between the airport and the city.\n\nThere are nearly 5,000 taxis licensed in Aizawl and are readily available. Rates are extremely high compared to the rest of India. Though there are official published rates, no taxi runs by these rates. The main contention from taxi drivers is that 1 km uphill costs more to run than downhill and with inclines being frequently 30% or more. A relatively short distance of 1 km costs around ₹50. A taxi to or from the airport costs around ₹800 (July 2012) to/from the central areas of Aizawl. However, the price is liable to go up if petrol prices rise or if a landslide blocks the main road (requiring a longer alternate route).\n\nSure Taxis offers a service to find, negotiate rates on your behalf and dispatch taxis to your location: and they don't charge anything to you. They also offer rental cars (with a driver) such as Altos, Boleros and Scorpios. Their numbers are: 0389 232 2833 &amp; 0389 232 1494\n\n==See==\n\n\n* \n* \n\n==Do==\n*  from Aizawl\n| phone= | tollfree=\n| hours= | price=\n| wikidata=Q60756194\n| lastedit=2024-02-28\n| content=The park is at an elevation of 1129 metres, making it one of the highest parks in the state.

Some of the terrain in the park is hilly so be sure to wear appropriate footwear.\n}}\n\n==Buy==\n\n*Visit Hnam Chhantu Pawl. It has local handicraft items for sale at very reasonable rates. This shop is run by an NGO and is located in Electric Veng, Near Grace Hospital And Nursing, Aizawl. Ask for Champai Sumo counters, the shop is close by, on the second floor of a building. It is famous, so you can ask local people and they will guide you. Alternately, you can reach the store at hnamchhantu@rediffmail.com.\n*The main shopping centres in Aizawl are Bara Bazar, Millennium Centre and Solomon's cave. In these centres, you'll find all kinds of wares available: from garments, cosmetics and shoes to vegetables and poultry. These are the main city shopping centres. For handicraft, Zohanco in Zarkawt has shawls, puan, bags and furnishing materials. For bamboo works such as baskets and khumbeu the finely mizo woven bamboo cap, these are available at MKVI, Sales Emporium, Zarkawt. However, the prices may not be very different from Mumbai or Delhi.\n\n==Eat==\n\nOn Sundays and holidays, almost all stores and restaurants are closed. Several street venders sell fried vegetables and pakoras during the day. David's kitchen and Hotel Millennium in Zarkawt Main Street may be open for limited hours with limited menu.\n\n*Curry Pot, Upper Khatla. Indian and Chinese food at reasonable prices. Also has a branch at Lengpui Airport.\n* David's Kitchen, G-16 Chanmari. One of the most popular restaurants in Aizawl. The food is decent and the service is good.\n* Pemarin Corner, 1st Floor, Shop No.40, Millennium Centre. Pemarin Corner is one of the higher end restaurants in Aizawl and is located in the Millennium Center building at the heart of the city. Millennium Centre has other small shops which serve momos and Chinese dishes.\n* \n\n==Drink==\nThe alcohol ban in Mizoram has been lifted, but there are no bars of any description. Licensed wine called Zawlaidi is available in various departmental stores.\n\nThere are very few places to have a casual non-alcoholic drink. There are two cafes, both part of a Zote Bakery outlet. One is in Dawrpui near the church and another in Electric Veng. Don't expect a wide range of drinks: It's either milky tea or milky coffee out of a Nescafe machine.\n\n==Sleep==\n\n* \n* \n* \n\nThe [https://tourism.mizoram.gov.in/page/list-of-tourist-lodges government of Mizoram] operates tourist lodges throughout the state, including 2 in the Aizawl suburbs. They are good value starting from ₹600.\n\n==Connect==\n\n==Go next==\n\n*Pick a picnic basket and head out for '''Tamdil (Tam Lake)'''. This natural lake is reputed for its fish and prawns and is an 85 km drive from Aizawl. The drive gives you an excellent opportunity to see some of the prettiest areas of Mizoram. Go for boat rides (if they are not closed because the boats are in bad shape) relax by the tranquil waters, and, if you can, take a drive into the nearby jungles, which are home to an assortment of fascinating flora and fauna. You can also stay here overnight. The resort village of Saituai is 10 km away. \n*Surrounded by a vast stretch of thick bamboo forests close to Thenzawl hill station is Mizoram's highest '''waterfall Vantawng''' (750 ft high). This popular water body, 152 km from Aizawl, is worth a visit. You can even stay overnight as it has a cafeteria and a cottage for hire. \n*Drive along the fertile plains of Champhai, about 200 km from Aizawl, to enjoy the stunning vista of emerald rice fields bordered by the smoky hills of Myanmar. Champai has the biggest stretch of plains in Mizoram, which are used for rice cultivation. The road from Aizwal to Champai is not very good in some places and it takes about 8 hours one way by a shared SUMO. A privately hired car may take about 6-7 hr; a top speed of only 40 km per hour is possible. But the raw and yet scenic beauty one enjoys along the winding, turning road which goes through thick forests, makes this a memorable experience.\n*One of the finest encounters with Mizoram's splendid vistas is '''Phawngpui''', its highest peak, extremely popular with trekkers and adventure enthusiasts. The Blue Mountain, as it is often referred to, is 300 km from Aizawl and close to the Myanmar border. Fragrant herbs and rare species of orchids and rhododendrons are found here.\n*'''Saiha''' is an angler's paradise on the Chhimtuipui, Mizoram's biggest river, 378 km from Aizawl.\n*'''Dampa''' is a tiger reserve located in West Phaileng district and is 127 km from Aizawl. It is better to book the government lodge well in advance. You need a permit from the forest officer staying in West Phaileng to enter the Dampa forest. This can also be obtained from forest department in Aizawl. You should be careful while visiting the forest on a rainy day as it is infested with leeches. This Sanctuary has different types of birds and animals, like tigers and elephants. \n*'''Reiek''' is a nice place near Aizawl and is a must-see. A taxi (Maruti 800/ Alto), costs about ₹1300-1400. A hired non AC small car (you never need an AC car in Mizoram!) like Wagon R, Indica, Santro etc., costs approximately ₹1800.\nReiek has a model Mizo village. Entry ticket is ₹20 for adults and ₹10 for children. Ask the ticket clerk for someone to show you around, otherwise you won't understand the exhibits; there is no extra charge for such a guide. In December, especially at Christmas time, this place is full of festivities with live music shows at the mountain summit, and there is a small stage built especially for the festivities.\n\n\n\n\n"

With a population of 120,000, Aizuwakamatsu has a rich warrior history, stretching back 1,000 years. Although the city is most known for the Byakkotai, a force of about 300 young samurai (13-17 year olds) in the Boshin Civil War. Nineteen of them committed suicide, declining surrender. Today, sake and lacquerware are the two main industries in Aizuwakamatsu. The Aizu region has spectacular natural scenery. Most visitors also make a journey to Mt. Bandai and Inawashiro for skiing, fishing and onsen.\n\n==Understand==\n\n===Tourist Information===\n* \n\n* \n\n* [http://samurai-city.jp/en/ SAMURAI CITY Aizuwakamatsu] is the city's official multilingual guide site.\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By plane===\n'''Fukushima Airport''' only has flights to Osaka Itami Airport and  Sapporo Chitose Airport. If you're using this airport, there are buses from the airport to Koriyama Station where you can catch a train bound for Aizu-Wakamatsu Station. For most travelers, '''Sendai Airport''' or one of Tokyo's airports will be more convenient. Sendai Airport has buses that travel directly to Aizu-Wakamatsu Station. If you fly into Tokyo, you can transfer to the Shinkansen or take a bus (see below).\n\n===By train===\nThe fastest and most convenient way to access Aizuwakamatsu is to take the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Koriyama, and transfer to the Ban-etsu Saisen Line. It takes about 3 hours and ¥9480.\n\n'''Tobu Railway''' and '''Aizu Railway''' also serve the area. Although Tobu Railway runs from Asakusa in Tokyo, it takes a lot more time to reach Aizu Wakamatsu than using JR, so these will be most useful for people in the Nikko/Kinugawa Onsen area or those who purchased travel passes from these railways.\n\n===By bus===\nJR East offers a direct highway bus service to Aizuwakamatsu from Tokyo's Shinjuku Highway Bus Terminal (located near the New South Exit of Shinjuku Station) to Aizuwakamatsu Bus Terminal (located opposite Aizuwakamatsu Station). There are also limited connections from Tokyo Station. It takes about 4 hours with 2 rest stops along the way. A one-way ticket costs around ¥2,500 and can be purchased at any JR ticket office.\n\nThere are also buses from Niigata and 4-6 departures arrive per day from Sendai. From Nagoya, there is a night bus to Koriyama from which you can catch a train to Aizu-Wakamatsu Station.\n\nFrom within the prefecture, there are also buses from Iwaki.\n\n===By car===\n\n==Get around==\nTo visit the major sightseeing spots, take the Sightseeing Bus from Aizuwakamatsu Station. You can buy a one-day pass for ¥500. There are two loop buses that go in opposite directions around the same route, so make sure your bus is going in the direction that will get you to your destination the fastest. If you're more adventurous (or if the bus times work against you), it takes about 40 minutes to walk to the castle or Iimoriyama and the Sazaedo from Aizu Wakamatsu Station.\n\n==See==\n\n* \n* \n\n* \n\n* \n* \n* \n===Nanokamachi Street ===\nA historic street with a variety of nostalgic buildings and sites related to Hideyo Noguchi, a man who did research in bacteriology and whose face is on the 1000 yen bill, and the Shinsengumi.\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Iimoriyama===\n\nMt. Iimoriyama (飯盛山) is famous for its associations with the Byakkotai (白虎隊, meaning White Tiger Force). After being defeated in a battle against the imperial forces, nineteen teenagers of the Byakkotai retreated to this hill. When they saw Tsuruga Castle burning, they thought it had fallen to the enemy and committed suicide. Their graves are on Mt. Iimoriyama where incense is always burnt on their behalf. Visitors can walk up the many steps to see the graves, or take the escalator for ¥250.\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Do==\n\n* \n\n===Higashiyama Onsen===\nA picturesque onsen area that is said to have been founded over 1300 years ago by the Priest Gyoki. Higashiyama Onsen has geisha (called ''geigi''). They are famous for their sad dance in honor of the death of the Byakkotai boys. These geisha can be reserved for ¥15,000 per performer for 90 minutes.\nThe water at Higashiyama Onsen is sulfate (specifically sodium-sulphate) which is said to be good for the skin, healing cuts, and high blood pressure. For those who want to enjoy the onsen without staying in Higashiyama, nine of the hotels and ryokan have hours for day visitors to enjoy the hot springs.\n\n===Events===\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Buy==\n\n'''Akabeko''' (赤べこ) - In the local Aizu dialect, \"Akabeko\" literally means \"red cow\". Akabeko has become the symbol of the Aizu region due to two local legends. First, during the construction of Enzo-ji Temple, red cows worked tirelessly to help move wood. Second, children who possessed a wooden toy Akabeko survived a plague that killed thousands of children. Wooden Akabekos similar to those featured in the latter legend can be bought. The most common design features a \"bobbing\" head mechanism where the head of the cow bobs. A large Akabeko can be found outside Aizuwakamatsu train station. Akabeko can be found at most souvenir shops throughout the city, but for the best variety in terms of number and size options, visit the '''Akabeko Crafter Bansho''' (See \"Do\" above).\n:\n'''Okiagari Koboshi''' (起き上がり小法師, literally \"getting up apprentice\") - A 400 year old pear-shaped, roly-poly craft with a happy face traditionally found wearing red or blue. Originally, these were purchased at the Tokaichi Market on January 10th as part of Aizu's New Years tradition. The proper way to buy them was to get one for each member of your family plus one more in hopes of blessing the family with a new child. For example, a family of 3 should buy 4 dolls. The Tokaichi Market is still held today, but Okiagari Koboshi can be bought any time of the year at most souvenir shops.

It has a boardwalk along its attractive coastline, with excellent restaurants and lots of Napoleon-related sites.\n\n==Understand==\nAlthough the coastline of Ajaccio and its natural harbour was almost certainly visited many times in antiquity, the development of a proper city did not happen until the late 1400s when the Genoese built a citadel that still stands to this day and serves as a military installation for the French army.\n\nAfter most of Corsica was conquered by the French in the 1700s, Ajaccio remained a Genoese territory until the late 1760s.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte (Napoleone di Buonaparte) was born in Ajaccio in 1769 just after the city became the capital of Corsica.  Although from mostly Italian-Corsican heritage, Napoleon rose through the ranks of the French military to become the leader of France and then Emperor.

To get to Ajman you can take a taxi from any airport to Ajman city, or other wise rent a car and drive there through Emirates Highway. Taxis go to Sharjah and Dubai, and also to Ra's al Khaymah and Umm al Quwain. If you are planning to stay there and use it as base to visit Dubai expect traffic jams at rush hours.\n\n==Get around==\n\n\n===By taxi===\nTaxis are really easy to find and are convenient for getting around in Ajman. Of course taxis can also be used to get to other emirates too. Look for the unmetered Ajman taxi as they offer cheaper prices than the official metered ones, e.g. 10 dirhams to Sharja, 40 dirhams to Dubai (best during the peak times.)\n\nLook out for shared taxis that wait for 4 people to come and take the taxi, where you pay 10 dirhams to Dubai when 4 people are sharing the taxi. These are \"unofficial\" taxis, located in the Somali area of Ajman.\n\n===By tour bus===\nGuided tour buses can be found at top hotels where can arrange a tour to Ajman and main attractions in it.\n\n==See==\n* \n\n'''Beach'''\n\nAjman beach is always a nice place to spend the day in with the warm sun, white sands, and clear waters. Dolphin spotting is also a recreation activity enjoyed in the emirate.\n\n==Buy==\n\nDesigner outlets and major brands are available in City Center Mall and consist of a wide variety of food outlets too. In the traditional side, there is always the Iranian souq were you can buy domestic goods and if you are lucky some interesting pottery.\n\n==Eat==\n\n* '''India House''' (Sheikh Humaid bin Abdul al-Aziz St; mains 4 to 10 Dhs)\n\n* '''Lulu Hypermarket''' has a nice cafe that is not too pricey, average 10 dirhams for a whole meal with a drink, and portions are huge so it is money well spent. A wide selection of smoothies are also available at reasonable prices.\n* Beach front cafe eating is good and cheap.  2 doner kebab style wrap sandwiches in chicken or lamb, with fresh fruit smoothie costs about 15 Dhs.\n* Maramis Cafe is the best place for Shisha in Ajman. Air conditioned and quality service with Internet.\n* \n* '''Viking Restaurant.''' A unique medieval-styled restaurant located in the Heritage Area of Ajman. Inside customers can enjoy the live shows, including live music and fire performances, and try dishes, inspired by Viking culture. Interiors are decorated in a medieval style too. As of January 2024 it's the number 1 restaurant in Ajman by TripAdvisor rating and World Culinary Awards.\n\n==Drink==\nAlcohol is allowed in Ajman and is available easily at hotels and restaurants.\n\nTap water is considered ok but it has a slightly salted taste. The obvious reason is that desalination plants are used to provide tap water.  More to the point, you can safely use it to brush your teeth and prepare tea.\n\nBottled water is also available in any store around town.\n\nThe famous \"Hole In The Wall\" - located next to the Kempinski Hotel Ajman - was one of the few liquor shops in Ajman. Now moved down the street near the Beach Resort.  It is NOT closed.\n\n==Sleep==\n===Mid-range===\n\n* '''Dana Beach Resort''', Arabian Gulf street, +971 6 742 9999.

The airport is well connected by daily flights from Delhi, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Indore Belgam and Surat. As of March 2021, SpiceJet, Indigo, and Star Air serve this airport.\n\n===By train===\n*From Delhi - the Delhi-Ahmedabad Mail is a decent overnight train (slow, but it gives you more time to sleep) while the Ajmer Shatabdi Express is the fastest way to get there. There are passenger trains (second unreserved only—definitely an \"experience\") in the morning and evening to Jaipur and train links down to Ahmedabad. The city is also connected to Udaipur, of which Intercity Express would be a better option.\n*From Kolkata - The Sealdah station and the Kolkata(Chitpur) station are well connected to Ajmer Junction. Trains like Ananya express (Sealdah), Sealdah-Ajmer Daily Express and Kolkata(Chitpur)-Ajmer express are trains for Ajmer.\n\n* \n\n===By bus===\nJaipur is 1½–3&amp;nbsp;hours by road (depending on the type of bus you take)(the Jaipur-Ajmer expressway also known as national highway 8 is a 6 lane road and is fantastic to drive on). Jodhpur is 4–5&amp;nbsp;hours in the opposite direction.\n\n===By taxi===\nVarious tour operators and travel agencies offer chauffeured car-taxi services; these are charged on a per km, per day basis. You can plan to take one to arrive into the city or take one for sightseeing in and around the city. If you want a decent car for the tour you can hire one from the stand in front of Zilla Parishad Bhawan (district's management headquarters); if you are good at bargaining, it's the best option.\n\nThere are also many car rental services which provide chauffeur-driven cars to Ajmer.\n\n==Get around==\n\nAjmer is a very limited market place, once you get your bearings. Dargah Bazaar is about 15&amp;nbsp;minutes walk from railway station, and Ana Sagar (\"lake\" - which has marble pavilions in a garden and is a wonderful place to sit, especially on hot days) is about 30 minutes' walk. There are some wonderful back-alleys—just wander down small side streets from Dargah bazaar and you'll see some wonderful old architecture and murals before you stumble back across the main street.\n\nOther than on foot, cycle rickshaws, autorickshaws (who are intent on taking you to Pushkar) and horse-drawn tongas are available for hire (the latter on selected routes only). There are also tempos and mini buses which run between bus stand and railway station and covering most over town - fare seems to be ₹10 in 2019.\n\n==See==\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n* \n \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Buy==\n\nAjmer has a women's market (ask for the Mahila Mandi - closed Tuesdays) that sells odnis (traditional veils... they also make nice light table covers) and saris galore. Ornate Lenghas (skirts worn with blouses) are also widely available. Hand tie-dyed turbans (safas) are 9-metre long bands of fabric with various uses and are usually sold wherever fabric for men's clothing is sold.\n\n==Eat==\n\n* There are some fast food outlets at India motor circle, this is 1&amp;nbsp;km from bus stand and railway station.\n* '''Honeydew restaurant''' (turn left exiting the station and walk about 2&amp;nbsp;minutes) has good western and delicious Indian curries in a nice garden and ac restaurant now fully renovated.you can also go there in the evening and eat and wait for your train if its late at night the restaurant closes at 11PM with very friendly and helpful staff.\n* For those who are looking for dhaba style delicious food must go to '''Mahadev ka Dhaba''' located opposite to '''Daulat Bagh''', this place is also known as '''Purana bus stand'''.\n* '''Hotel Bhola''' has great veg thalis. Also pandit bhojnalaya is a famous place for good and cheaper food.\n* There's a dhaba across from the railway station that serves great cheap food. It's tiny and attached to a mosque and painted green - I don't think that there's an English sign - you can fill up on chai, omelet and rotis .\n* There's a great non-veg restaurant in the Dargah Bazaar. about 2/3 of the way in on the left hand side. There's an A/C seating area in the basement. Dishes are ₹50-100\n* '''Pandit Restaurant''' is a famous place for good food. It is in front of Daulatbagh. This place is also known as Subhash Park.\n* If you have a hot palate, then you should try Indian snacks (Kachori, Samosa &amp; a special combination of kadi-bhujje, unique to Ajmer), these are available throughout the day, but a great way to start your day as breakfast. Some very famous options are Shankar Chaat at Gol Pyau, Kesarganj Gol Chakkar, Shree Namkeen &amp; Mahadev Chaat at Naya Bazaar.\n* \n* \n* \n\n==Drink==\n\n*Do Drink the Lemon Soda during summers in the Dargah Bazaar made by machines which is served in a nice looking bottle and the taste is very refreshing.\n*Also try the famous Dahi-Lassi which is famous in Ajmer because it is made of pure authentic milk and it has an unforgettable taste.\n\n==Sleep==\n* There are numerous hotels and guest houses near the Dargah. But if you are going during the Urs season, make sure you book your rooms 2-3 months earlier if possible.\n* \n* '''Hotel Pandit''' has economical rooms and it is situated in center of bus stand and railway station just opposite to Subhash Park.\n* '''Khadim tourist''' bungalow run by RTDC has rooms in economy range and it is very near to bus stand, 2&amp;nbsp;km from the railway station.\n* \n\n==Go next==\n* The town of Pushkar, famous for its camel races, lake and Hindu Brahma temple, is very close by.\n* Jaipur\n* Udaipur\n*Jaisalmer\n* Delhi\n\n\n\n"

The island is commonly referred to as '''Aka''' and is popular with tourists from Okinawa and mainland Japan.\n\nImage:Akajima1.jpg|thumb|400px|Bridge between Akajima Island (left) and Gerumajima Island (right)\n\n==Get in==\nKerama Airport on the neighboring uninhabited island of Fukaji would be easily accessible, but as of 2009 has no scheduled services.\n\nThe usual approach is thus to take the high speed ferry from Naha city on Okinawa Island. The journey takes about 1 hour and usually makes a stop at the larger Zamami island before stopping at Aka Port. There is a cheaper ferry but you will get less time to enjoy the island. Return ferries to Naha usually depart around 17:00 and costs about ¥3,000.\n\n==Get around==\n\nAka can easily be explored on foot, bicycle or kayak. The heat can make moving about difficult but there are plenty of opportunities to jump in the sea and cool off.\n\nThe islands of Geruma (慶留間), population 81, and Fukaji (外地島), population zero plus the airport, are connected to Akajima by bridge.\n\n==See==\nVenture around the island to discover remote beaches. There are 3 observation towers on Aka where you can take photographs of Aka's unspoilt beauty. When leaving Aka Port the locals like to wave goodbye and perform acrobatic dives into the sea. Watch out for the giant Okinawan tree spiders if you take the beaten paths down to the sea. There are also deer that swim between the islands.\n\n==Do==\nSnorkel, scuba dive or kayak from any beach and you will soon encounter a rich variety of tropical sea life.\n\n==Buy==\nBuy snorkeling equipment before you arrive. Other than food and drink there is not much to buy on Aka.\n\n==Eat==\nThere is a shack style restaurant near Aka Port but amenities on the island are basic. The locals are extremely friendly and will soon point you in the right direction. If staying at a local guest house you can often eat with your hosts.\n\n==Drink==\nThere are plenty of drink vending machines on Aka and you can usually get a cold glass of Orion (Okinawan beer) at any place that sells food.\n\nImage:AkajimaPort.jpg|thumb|400px|Locals from Akajima Island perform an acrobatic farewell for the evening ferry\n\n==Sleep==\nThere are some guest houses and rooms to hire on Aka but no large hotels. Camping on beaches is strictly forbidden, although it's quite acceptable to drink and eat on the beaches until sunrise. You might want to befriend a local Okinawan to help you source accommodation.\n\n==Connect==\n\n==Go next==\nAfter a day on Aka you will not want to leave, but the neighbouring islands within the Kerama Islands group are all worth a visit.\n\n\n\n\n"

In the name, '''Mashū''' was added in 2017.\n\n==Understand==\n\nThe park's attractions are its three sparkling clear mountain lakes, the eponymous '''Lake Akan''' ( ''Akan-ko'') to the west, '''Lake Mashū''' ( ''Mashū-ko'') to the east and '''Lake Kussharo''' ( ''Kussharo-ko'') between them.  The largest settlement nearby is '''Teshikaga''' (), to the south of Lakes Kussharo and Mashu.\n\n===Information Site===\nMinistry of Environment has an [https://www.env.go.jp/park/akan/ official bilingual webpage] for the park.\n\n[https://untouchedhokkaido.jp/en/ Untouched Hokkaido] is a bilingual guide site by local tourism associaitons, mainly focusing on nature.\n\n==Get in==\n===By plane===\nThe nearest airports are in Kushiro, an hour and a half to the south, Nakashibetsu, an hour to the east, and Memanbetsu, an hour and a half to the north.\n\n===By train===\nThe '''JR Senmō Line''' () runs north–south across the park on its way from Abashiri ('''網'''走) to Kushiro ('''釧'''路), stopping at Kawayu and Teshikaga (Mashu station).\nThere are around 4 trains daily to Abashiri (2 hours, &amp;yen;1600) and 6–7 to Kushiro (1 hr 40 min, &amp;yen;1790).\n\n===By bus===\nThere are 4 buses daily between Akan and Kushiro station. Infrequent buses connect the lakes to each other and the train station at Bihoro. In the high season (May–October) busses run to Lake Onnetto, serving the Meakan and Akan Fuji trail-heads.\n\n==Get around==\n\nBuses are infrequent and cover only the main routes.  A rental car will come in very handy here.\n\nA 2days pass is available at hotels, convenience store and train stations. It gets you around the area with Eco-friendly buses (run on bio diesel fuel) and it's also valid on the JR Senmo line between JR Mashu and JR Kawayuonsen.

                    "text": "\n'''Akaroa''' is a charming harbourside town on the eastern side of Akaroa harbour, in southern Banks Peninsula in the Canterbury (New Zealand)|Canterbury region of New Zealand. Its early settlers were French and British. It was the only French settlement in New Zealand. Aspects of its French heritage remain, such as names of streets and businesses.\n\n==Understand ==\n\"Akaroa\" is Maori for \"Long Harbour\". The village is snuggled into a wide bay on the eastern side of the rugged harbour, with Onuku Marae a little further south. The permanent population of around 600 (2013) in this historic village swells significantly over summer.  \n\nAkaroa's harbour is home to an array of wildlife, most notably the rare Hector's dolphin. Cruises and dolphin swimming are popular attractions.\n\n==Get in==\n\n\n\n\n===By car===\nAkaroa is 85&amp;nbsp;km (80– to 90-minute drive) from Christchurch on SH75, which winds over the hills of the rugged Banks peninsula with breathtaking views.\n\n===By bus===\n\n*[http://www.akaroabus.co.nz/Menu/Tour-Information.php Akaroa French Connection] bus departs Christchurch daily at 9AM.

Tenders bring passengers to the shallow-water main wharf in the centre of town. The small town can be easily walked and explored in several hours. To get to the centre of town, walk north on Beach Rd with the French Bay waters on your left for about 10 minutes to get to Rue Balguerie.  On cruise ship days, a free shuttle operates every 15 minutes from the main wharf to the centre of Akaroa (Akaroa Tourist Information Centre) and to the Recreation Ground (end of town).\n\nAkaroa is the base port for excursions to Christchurch (the port of Lyttelton has been closed to cruise ships since being badly damaged in the 2011 earthquake). Christchurch city is 1.5 hours drive away. Shuttle services: Akaroa Shuttle (white and red) and French Connection (CityLine) buses to Christchurch leave from the main wharf.\n\n*[https://www.akaroashuttle.co.nz/ Akaroa Shuttle] Christchurch Direct Shuttle bus departs Akaroa at 9:45AM and travels to Rolleston Ave, close to Hagley Park, Botanic Gardens, Punting on the Avon, and the Museum.

The main axis comprises all of the Rue Lavaud, part of Beach Road, and includes streets and areas to the east of these two principal arteries. The axis of the area runs roughly north and south with the northern end beginning at the junction of the Rue Lavaud with Woodills Road, and the southern end terminating at the Garden of Tane, about a half an hour walk end to end. The eastern boundary of the area includes the L'Aube Hill Reserve and French Cemetery, and Stanley Park. The western boundary is the French Bay, marked by Dalys Wharf at the end of the Rue Balguerie and by the Main Wharf at Beach Rd and Church St.\n\n* \n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Do==\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Buy==\n\n\n==Eat==\n*\n* \n\n==Drink==\n\n==Sleep==\n===Backpackers===\n* \n* \n* \n\n==Connect==\n\n==Go next==\n\n|directionl1=NW\n|majorl1=Christchurch\n|minorl1=Tai Tapu\n|directionr1=SE\n|majorr1=END\n}}\n\n\n"

The Ottomans captured the region in the 14th century, without any battle here, whereupon it was called Akçaşehir. In 1934 it was renamed Akçakoca for the fellow who'd captured it. The town has industry and fishing but is nowadays mainly a tourist resort. \n\n== Get in ==\n\nAkçakoca is at the junction of Highway D010 along the coast and D655 which winds through the mountains from Düzce the provincial capital. Düzce is astride the main route between Istanbul and Ankara, and the drive from either is about 3 hours to Düzce then another 30 min to Akçakoca. This makes the place a weekend getaway from the big cities but too far for a day trip.\n\nBuses from Istanbul run every couple of hours and take 4-5 hours via Gebze and Düzce, for a fare in 2024 of 600 TL; they continue along the coast to Zonguldak. Four buses per day from Ankara take 3 hr 30 min via Bolu and Düzce. Bus lines include [https://www.metroturizm.com.tr/ Metro Turizm], [https://www.pamukkale.com.tr/ Pamukkale] and Flixbus. \n\n the bus station is at the highway junction 2 km east of town centre. Its facilities are seldom open. Dolmuşes run downtown and your ride should be included in your inter-city bus ticket, enquire when booking.\n\n== Get around ==\n* Buses and dolmuşes shuttle between downtown (''çarşı''), the bus station (''otogar'') and outlying districts.\n\n== See ==\n* \n*  or \"lighthouse\" is just a harbour light at the end of the breakwater, with views back over town. \n* '''Old Town''' is no more. Here and there you might find traditional Ottoman houses on the slopes above the beachfront, but they're either tumbledown, or caught in the crosshairs of the developers' sights, or modern retro creations. \n* '''Mehmet Arif Bey Köşkü''' in the east of town is shown on some maps as a museum, but it's a private mansion, and you can't really see the exterior behind the high walls. \n* \n* \n\n== Do ==\n \n* '''Beaches''' are narrow and suffer from erosion; island breakwaters stand east of the Marina breakwater to limit this. Değirmenağzı Plajı (Windmill Beach) 1 km west of town centre is larger, at the outlet of a stream. Kale Plajı (Castle Beach) just below the Genoese castle is a further km west.\n* '''Watch films about Lenin''' though you'll probably have to find them on an art-movie TV channel. In 1991 a wooden bust of Lenin was washed up hereabouts, presumably chucked away in some Soviet dominion after the fall of communism and the USSR in 1989. It lay for some years in a warehouse while the citizens debated what to do with it, but it's now a movie prop. ''Hoşgeldiniz Lenin'' was a short documentary of 2016, and in 2021 a full-length film ''You Me Lenin'' fictionalised the event, though its release coincided with covid and few got to see it. This film portrays the repressive 1990s, when Turkey's leaders detested communism yet showed themselves its successors by murdering or \"disappearing\" their political opponents.\n\n== Buy ==\n* Lots of convenience stores along Istanbul Cd a block back from the shore.\n\n== Eat ==\n\n* East from the Marina are [https://www.akcakocakamelya.com/ Kamelya], [http://capaakcakoca.com/ Çapa], Bahce Cafe Lounge and Kuzin.\n* Balik Evi is at the Marina, then west are Kordon Cafe, Seyir Cafe and Gurme.\n\n== Drink ==\n* Cafes may serve alcohol, there's no free-standing bar.\n\n== Sleep ==\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n*  is an outlying resort district east of the bus station. [https://eftelyaotel.com/ Eftelya] is the main hotel here, and campsites are further along the coast.\n\n== Connect ==\nAkçakoca and its approach roads have 4G from all Turkish carriers. As of March 2024, 5G has not rolled out in Turkey.\n\n== Go next ==\n* Zonguldak east is a grubby former mining port. Continue east for more attractive Amasra.\n* Bolu inland is on the Ankara-Istanbul trading route, with a museum and several historic mosques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Large parts of Akershus are effectively suburbs for Oslo and also home to important industrial and business districts. While this is a single urban area it is relatively spaciously laid out, Greater London for instance has 10 times higher population density than the urban area. Only the eastern and northern agricultural districts of Akershus are clearly not part of the metropolis. If forests and agricultural areas are included the population density of Oslo region is similar to the Netherlands. Oslo airport sits at Gardermoen on the flatlands near Jessheim. Oslo and the former county combined are home to more than 25% of Norway's population. Oslo and Akershus has traditionally been governed as one district for instance with a joint governor.\n\nRomerike area in the north is relatively flat or gentle hills. Norway's largest rivers (Vorma and Glomma) flows through the eastern parts of the region and there are major lakes and countless smaller lakes. The northern end of the area touches the south end of Mjøsa, Norway's biggest lake. There is also some rugged, low altitude terrain in Bærum and Asker and in Østmarka (east Oslo forest).\n\nFollo is a traditional district located between Oslo and Østfold and includes southern suburbs of Oslo with a total of more than 100,000 inhabitants. Ski is the centre of Follo. Several settlements in Follo are situated along this coastline, like Nesoddtangen, Drøbak and Son, as well as several beaches that are well frequented in the summer. During the winter there are good opportunities of skiing in Østmarka and Sørmarka. 'Follo' presumably derive from 'Foldin', the old name for the wider reaches of the Oslo Fjord. Drøbak was for centuries the winter and transshipment harbour for Oslo. Hølen, Son, Hvitsten and Drøbak are all small coastal towns whose history as important trading ports is still very evident. The many discoveries of prehistoric hill forts, burial mounds and rock carvings in the areas cultivated during the Stone and Bronze Ages indicate that the Follo region has always been an attractive place to live in. Norway's largest collection of Stone Age dwellings and implements was discovered next to the Bunnefjord. Son, Drøbak and Hvitsten first became known as artists' colonies in the mid-nineteenth century. Edward Munch found inspiration for several of his paintings in this coastal landscape. \n\nThe urban area is concentrated around the northern (inner) part of Oslofjord in a horseshoe shape along a driving distance of some 50 kilometers. Within this horseshoe most people live with a view of the fjord or within minutes of the shore. In addition there is a north-eastern axis from central Oslo through the eastern valley and a low elevation to Lillestrøm at the other side of the waterdivide. Drøbak sits at the strategic narrow entrance to inner Oslofjord. The Oscarsborg fortress was installed to control this narrow strait. Inside the strait the Oslofjord is a sheltered small ocean with countless islands and peninsulas.\n\nOslo, Bærum and Asker are separated from the surrounding areas by hills and forests, and there are several smaller rivers flowing to Oslofjord. There are countless lakes in these uplands. These undeveloped hills and forests are collectively known as ''Marka'' and are protected by law. Marka covers about one third of the Oslo region. The largest part of Marka stretches for some 40-50 km north from the city to Lunner in Oppland. There are additional wide forests covering large parts of the region, about 60 % of the area is covered by forest. There officially some 3000 lakes covering 7 % of the region. \n\nNorway's first railway line, ''Hovedbanen'' (literally \"The main line\"), was built between Oslo and Eidsvoll via Lillestrøm in 1854. This stretch is still Norway's main transport corridor and main roads E6 and E16 runs across the plains north of Oslo. When Oslo airport was constructed on the Romerike plains in the 1990s, the main line was shifted to include the airport.\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By boat===\nImage:Crown of Scandinavia.jpg|thumb|The huge ferry to Copenhagen in port\nOslo is connected to Denmark and Germany by '''car ferry'''.

They both take some 3½ hours to reach Denmark.\n\nThe train station in Kristiansand is close to the ferry quay, while in Larvik the quay has been moved to a location which is a bit of a trek from the station.\n\nFerry company [http://www.fjordline.com/ Fjord Line] operates ferries on the route Langesund (by the E18, 3 hours south of Oslo by car) to Hirtshals (4½ hours).\n\nThe [http://www.oslohavn.no/en/passengers/passenger_traffic/cruise/ '''cruise ports'''] in Oslo are on four different Sentrum piers, from west to east: ''Filipstad'' (330 m (LOA), 8.5 m draft), west of Aker Bryyge; ''Søndre Akershuskai'' (345 m (LOA), 10.3 m draft), the main pier by Akershus Fortress; ''Vippetangkaia'' (249 m (LOA), 7.3 m draft), south of Akershus Fortress; ''Revierkaia'' (294 m (LOA), 8.3 m draft), south of the Opera House.

There is a free transfer bus to a nearby railway station.\n\n===By train===\n'''Oslo Central Station''' (''Oslo Sentralstasjon''/''Oslo S'', T-bane, tram, bus: ''Jernbanetorget'') is at the eastern end of the downtown Oslo. Oslo S is the center of rail travel in Norway as all lines (including the airport express train) terminate at Oslo S. Trains between other western, southern and eastern towns in Oslo region runs through Oslo S. The major express buses go to the bus station next door to the train station.\n\nTrains from Bergen and Stavanger (via Kristiansand) pass through Asker and Bærum (Sandvika) towards Oslo S.

The public transportation system is relatively good. All railway lines run through the area and serves long distance as well as local trains. Oslo itself has a fine public transport network of frequent metro, tram and bus departures. Some metro and tram lines cross the city line to Bærum. Buse lines cover the whole urban area as one integrated system. There are buses going between the major cities and stopping at bus stops marked with a sign (blue with a white bus on it, rectangular) and/or an open air booth with the place name written above with white lettering. Public transport is reasonably inexpensive though costs can build up if you buy tickets every time you get on, day/week/month/season passes can be purchased at the major stops. At the central bus station in any town, cashiers will speak English. For local buses, see http://ruter.no.

                    "text": "\n'''Akhaltsikhe''' (Georgian phrasebook|Georgian: ახალციხე, \"New Fortress\") is a small city of about 18,000 people (2014) and the capital of Samtskhe-Javakheti. It's a rather sleepy town, but its Old City and Old Turkish baths are worth a visit, and it's a great base for exploring the surrounding areas, including Sapara Monastery in the immediate vicinity and Vardzia to the south with Khertvisi and Tmogvi Fortresses along the way.\n\n==Understand==\n\nThe city has been around for at least 800 years, and was the seat of the House of Akhaltsikhe, dukes of Samtskhe, for several centuries. In 1576 the Ottomans took the city; they built most of the old buildings a tourist can see here. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829 Russians captured the city. Until the 20th century Akhaltsikhe was mostly Armenian, but today around 27% are Armenians and the rest are Georgians. There is some language tension between city inhabitants.\n\n==Get in==\n===By marshrutka===\n\nAll marshrutkas from major Georgian cities stop at Borjomi and at Khashuri bus station. Hence, if you missed your ride, it's not terribly difficult to catch a marshrutka going between Akhaltsikhe and Khashuri before dinner time.\n\n&lt;small&gt;(As of Mch. 2022 the prices quoted have risen 20-25%.)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nFrom specific destinations:\n* Tbilisi (Didube bus station) &amp;ndash; 08:00–19:00 hourly. 3 hr. 15 lari. (updated Sept 2022)\n* Kutaisi &amp;ndash; 08:20, and 13:00. 3½ hr. 10-12 lari.\n* Gori &amp;ndash; 08:30. 2½ hr. 10 lari. (updated Apr 2022)\n* Batumi (from old bus station near Batumi train station, via Khashuri) &amp;ndash; 08:30, and ~10:30. 5½-6 hr. 20 lari.\n* Borjomi &amp;ndash; Every 30-60 min. 1 hr. 3 lari.\n* Vardzia &amp;ndash; 9:00, 13:00 and 15:00. 1½ hr. 6.50 lari. (updated Apr 2022)\n* Nakalakevi/Tmogvi (near Vardzia) &amp;ndash; ~08:10-08:20.\n\nTo specific destinations (vice-versa, if not listed above, should be similarly frequent):\n* Ninotsminda &amp;ndash; 08:15, and 15:00. 1½ hr. 7 lari. They obviously also go by Akhalkalaki.\n* Gori &amp;ndash; 08:15, and 13:00. 2½ hr. 7 lari.\n* Kutaisi &amp;ndash; 10:40, 15:00, and 18:10. 3½ hr. 17 lari. (updated Apr 2022)\n* Batumi (via Khashuri) &amp;ndash; 08:30, and 11:30. 6 hr. 20 lari.\n* Batumi (via Khulo, Jun-Aug) &amp;ndash; 10:00. 6 hr. 18 lari.\n* Vardzia &amp;ndash; 12:20 and 17:30. 1½ hr. 6.50 lari. (updated Apr 2022)\n* Mirashkhani (passing through Vardzia) - 10:35 and 16:00. 1½ hr. 7 lari. (updated Apr 2022)\n\nThere are few direct marshrutkas from/to Yerevan, '''Armenia''', or several connections from Armenia when making a stopover in Akhalkalaki. There is also a daily connection from Gyumri, which starts at 10:00 (3½ hr, 4,000 dram).\n\n===By thumb===\nThe direct road from Batumi to Akhaltsikhe is not served by marshrutkas, probably due its bad state and the mountain pass. Nevertheless, you should be able to catch a (4WD) ride on that road. But it will be bumpy and probably still take at least 4 hr.\n\n===By car===\nThe principal route to Akhaltsikhe runs from Georgia's main East-West highway (E60) at the spur in Khashuri leading to Borjomi.\n\nThere's also a route from Batumi via Gorzerdzi pass (4WD needed, closed in winter, scenic views).\n\n===By train===\nThere was a train in the past, but nowadays the nearest railway station is Borjomi with connections from Tbilisi and Khashuri.\n\n==Get around==\n\nMost of the centre can be explored on foot. However, the highway between Borjomi and Vardzia is about 2 km east of the centre and 2.5-3 km east of the castle.\n\n==See==\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Further afield===\n\n\n* \n\n==Do==\n* \n\n==Buy==\n\n==Eat==\n\n==Drink==\n\n==Sleep==\nThe street from the underpass near the police station and the castle gate is lined with small family-run hotels, in all 15-20. Most of them close during winter. Expect to pay 30-50 Lari (2022).\n\n* \n* \n\nIf you can make yourself understood, you can overnight in the Sapara Monastery's chambers, 10-12 km outside of Akhaltsikhe.\n\n==Go next==\n===Inside Georgia===\n* Vardzia &amp;mdash; the cliff-side cave monastery, a former city, is the biggest reason to visit Akhaltsikhe, and the region more generally. A round trip by taxi from Akhaltsikhe might cost about 50-60 lari (or marshrutka 7 lari one way, as of July 2022).\n* Abastumani &amp;mdash; an interesting and off-the-touristic-map, former Soviet spa town with still functioning sulphur and thermal baths. \n* Akhalkalaki &amp;mdash; the center of Armenian culture in Georgia is nearby to the southwest, easily accessible via marshrutka from Akhaltsikhe.\n* Borjomi &amp;mdash; every Soviet traveller’s favourite Georgian retreat, for its parks, Romanov palace, and internationally renowned natural mineral water.\n* Khashuri &amp;mdash; an interesting small town with an abundance of hammocks.\n\n===Outside Georgia===\n* Armenia &amp;mdash; There are two marshrutkas to Yerevan, Armenia, at 04:00 and 07:00 (7 hr, 20-35 lari). If you miss them, go to Akhalkalaki, from where marshrutkas leave to Yerevan almost every hour. Either the same or an additional one also goes to Gyumri at 07:00 (4 hr, 20 lari).\n* Turkey &amp;mdash; In July 2024 there was no direct transport to Turkey anymore (suspended since COVID-19). In May 2019, you could buy bus tickets to Turkey from the central bus station. Tickets to Posof (city on the Turkish side) were US$10 and left at 14:30. There was a bus to Kars with Kars Vipturizm 4449188. It went Wednesday and Sunday at 13:00 and cost 70 TL (or 35 lari). Hitching to Kars is also an option and can be done in far less than a day. From the central bus station, ask for the road to the Turkish border (''Turetskoĭ granitsy'') and start flagging cars about 1 km from the bus station down the road. The road will pass through the small town of Vale. You are able to walk across the border. Alternatively, a taxi to the border costs 20-25 lari.\n\n Ardahan\n| minorl1= Vale/Türkgözü\n| directionr1=E\n| majorr1= Ninotsminda/Bavra\n| minorr1='''Akhalkalaki'''\n}}\n\n\n\n"

Its longitude is about the middle of the prefecture, and so is reachable from both the north and south.\n\n===Climate===\n\n\nIn Akita, late June to late July is the rainy season.  The spring and summer before and after that tend to have fairly moderate amounts of rain, and are good for outdoor activities.  In November, it is common for some cold weather thunder storms to occur—this is said to mark the end of fall and the beginning of ''hatahata'' (a local fish) season.  In the winter, Akita sees some snow, though certainly inland areas get more.\n\n===Tourist Information Site===\n[https://www.akita-yulala.jp/en/ Akitachi Plus] is the city's official multilingual guide site.\n\n==Get in==\n===By plane===\nAkita has an airport, with domestic flights coming in from such places as Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka and Sapporo. Buses connect the airport with Akita Station (秋田駅) -- a ride costs ¥980 and takes 40&amp;nbsp;minutes.\n\n===By train===\nAkita can be reached by Shinkansen (bullet train) along the Akita Shinkansen Line (秋田新幹線).  ''Komachi'' (こまち) trains are available from either Tokyo or Ueno stations in Tokyo and make stops at Omiya, Sendai and Morioka before slowing down to travel to Shizukuishi, Tazawako, Kakunodate, Omagari (where it changes direction), and finally Akita over conventional rail lines. The trip takes just under four hours and costs about ¥10,000 in a standard class car.\n\nWhen the Akita Shinkansen runs on conventional lines it slows down to regular train speeds and it will stop several times to allow other trains to pass. This will be a bit of a disappointing shock after zooming through northern Japan at top speeds as far as Morioka. In return, the views from the slowed down of the interior of Tohoku are beautiful.\n\nBe aware that the Komachi trains are coupled to Hayabusa trains, which split at Morioka, but as all seats are reserved, the chance of getting in the wrong car is minimal at best. For foreign tourists traveling from Tokyo, the better deal is to purchase a '''JR East Rail Pass''' or the national '''Japan Rail Pass'''.\n\n===By bus===\n* JR Bus operates the ''Dream Akita-Yokohama'' overnight bus to Akita from the bus terminal at Yokohama Station (9 hr 45 min, ¥9,500) and from Tokyo Station (8 hr 45 min, ¥9,100).\n* Odakyu and Akita Chuo Kotsu run the ''Flora'' overnight bus from Tokyo/Shinjuku|Shinjuku (8&amp;nbsp;hours, ¥9,450).\n* The ''Senshuu'' daytime bus runs from Sendai with multiple departures (3½&amp;nbsp;hours, ¥4,000).\n\n===By boat===\n* \n\n==Get around==\n\nYou can get around by bus, taxi, car, or bike.  Many bus routes start in front of Akita Station.  In the winter, there can be snow and ice, so drivers should decrease their speed.\n\nOn the 2nd level of the JR Akita train station is a Tourist Information office.

Kiritanpo is essentially a tube made of rice, generally formed around a disposable chopstick. It is often roasted, sometimes after being smothered in miso paste. It is also eaten in '''kiritanpo nabe''', a stew of sliced kiritanpo, vegetables, and chicken or fish, most commonly eaten during the winter. Of course, there are many non-local styles of food available in Akita City, including a wide variety of ramen and Indian restaurants.\n* \n* \n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Drink==\nAs one of Japan's most famous rice-growing regions, Akita has some of the best local sake in all of Japan. A great place to find many different bottles for sale (and usually free samples) is in the [http://www.a-bussan.jp/ Prefectural Goods Shop] (あきた県産品プラザ, ''akita-renritsu puraza'') in the basement of the Atorion Concert Hall.\n\n==Sleep==\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Stay safe==\nThere are bears in Akita. You won't find one trundling along Chuo Odori outside Akita Station, but visitors who are in Akita to enjoy its semi-rural outskirts such as Akita Onsen or the Our Lady of Akita Convent should familiarise themselves with bear safety. You will see signs scattered around warning of bear danger but if you cannot read Japanese they won't be much good to you. It's always best to assume that bears may be in the area, including in the colder months.\n\nThe Asian black bear is a retiring kind of beast. It's unlikely to bother you if you don't bother it and for that reason its best to avoid startling a bear, so make noise as you walk and keep a look out. Having said that, it could easily maul you to death so caution is advised. See Dangerous animals.\n\n==Go next==\n* Kakunodate, one of Japan's last true historical towns and filled with old samurai houses open to the public, is only about an hour away by shinkansen.\n* Lake Towada, a beautiful blue lake, is several hours away.\n* Lake Tazawa, with great hiking and skiing, is several hours away.\n* Mt.

The trains only stop at Ueno, Omiya, Sendai and Morioka before slowing down to travel to Shizukuishi, Tazawako, Kakunodate, Omagari, and finally Akita over conventional rail lines. Trains also reverse direction once at Omagari, the stop before Akita. Komachi trains from Tokyo reach Akita in four hours and cost ¥16,800 each way. Beware that the Komachi trains are coupled to Aomori-bound Hayate trains, which split at Morioka, but as all seats are reserved the chance of getting in the wrong car is minimal at best. For foreign tourists traveling from Tokyo, the better deal is to purchase a '''JR East Rail Pass''' or the national '''Japan Rail Pass'''.\n* The ''Akebono'' overnight sleeper train from Tokyo's Tokyo/Ueno|Ueno station, and the ''Nihonkai'' from Osaka and Kyoto, stop in Akita before terminating in Aomori.\n\n===By bus===\n* JR Tohoku Bus operate a long distance bus '''Dream Akita/Yokohama Express''' from Tokyo and Yokohama.

It is also eaten in ''kiritanpo nabe'', a stew of sliced kiritanpo, vegetables, and chicken or fish, most commonly eaten during the winter.\n\nThough consumed throughout Japan, Akita's Oga|Oga Peninsula is known for ''inago'', a sweet teriyaki-like dish made of grasshoppers cooked in sake, soy sauce, and sugar.\n\nIn late winter, ''hatahata'', or sailfin sunfish is popular, usually cooked in a stew. It has a strong flavor, and females with intact egg pouches are most prized.\n\n==Drink==\nAkita is famous for its rice ''akitakomachi'' for food, but different varieties, such as ''sakekomachi'', are used to brew many brands of sake, some of which are popular throughout Japan. Many of Akita's towns have a local sake brewery, some of which offer tours.\n\nOn the outskirts of Kakunodate is the Tazawako Brewery.

                    "text": "\n:''For the Akko in Gombe State, Nigeria, see Akko (Gombe)''\n'''[http://www.akko.org.il/ Akko]''' (Hebrew phrasebook|Hebrew: עכו), also known historically to Arabs as عكّا ('Akka) and Westerners as '''Acre''', lies on the northern edge of the Bay of Acre in northern Israel and receives many Baha'i pilgrims. On its present site, Akko possesses a long history of various cultures: Israelites, Greeks, Romans, Crusaders and Arabs. Akko is the holiest city in the Baha'i Faith and has been recognised as a  as a site of extraordinary significance to the world's cultural heritage.\n\n==Get in==\nGetting to Akko is very simple, as it is on the Mediterranean Coast directly to the north of Haifa and on the main Israeli railway track.\n\n===By train===\n* \n\n===By bus===\n has a slow (especially at rush hour) connection to Akko for ₪11.7 from Haifa and from Carmiel. Take lines 271/361/500 from Haifa (Merkazit Hamifratz - the eastern bus station in Haifa Bay), 361 from Safed, and 500 from Galilee Panhandle|Kiryat Shmona. There are also some less frequent routes you can take, so whenever an intercity bus comes, ask if it goes where you need.\n\nNote, buses from Haifa to Akko start outside of Haifa at the Merkazit Hamifratz (Bay Central) bus station. To get there, you have to take a local bus for ₪5.90. Considering this, it is mostly always better to take the train directly.\n\nBetween Akko and Nazareth take bus 353, going about every hour but ending early in the afternoon. Bus 343 also travels this route, but it's extremely slow, visiting each of the small villages along the way. If bus 353 is not available, take a bus/train to Haifa and then another bus to Nazareth.\n\n===By taxi===\n* A \"service taxi\" (Hebrew: מונית שרות; ''moNEET sheROOT'') is an interurban van carrying 10 passengers. These travel frequently from the Hadar neighborhood of Haifa to Akko. They cost about the same as the bus. Look for a Hebrew-only sign saying \"Akko Nahariya\" or \"Akko Karmiel\" in the front windshield of the service taxi. If you don't know Hebrew, go to Herzl Street in Haifa, point an index finger at a 45 degree angle with the ground (the Israeli hitchhiking signal) when a service taxi drives by, and ask where it's going. They pick up and offload passengers at bus stops. Unlike public transportation (bus and train) which cease service during the '''Jewish Sabbath''', this line runs up to midnight on Fridays and during the day on Saturday.\n* Private taxis are available but are very costly. This is an option if you're traveling in a group of up to 4 passengers and/or have a lot of luggage.\n\n===By boat===\nA foot-passenger [http://www.akko.org.il/en/Ferry-from-Akko-to-Haifa-/ ferry] plies between Haifa and Akko on four days a week. It sails M Tu W from Akko at 10:00 and 15:00, returning from Haifa at 11:00 and 16:00. Saturday it sails from Akko at 09:30, 12:30 and 16:30, returning at 11:00, 13:30 and 17:30. This means a day trip is possible in either direction. It's only a small boat so sailings are cancelled in bad weather. The departure point from Akko is the new terminal within the Old Port. Fares are ₪30 one way and ₪55 round trip. Online booking is only possible [http://www.malkatakko.co.il/ in Hebrew], otherwise call 04-9913890 or just go to the terminal ticket office.\n\nAkko has a marina but is not a port of entry into Israel. Vessels from abroad must first head for Haifa port where there are 24 hour facilities for immigration and customs clearance.\n\n==Get around==\n\n\nThe Old City is very small, and easily walked across. It is also within walking distance of the train and bus stations. For the Bahai holy site, though, you will likely want to take a taxi or bus (271 as it continues north of Akko toward Nahariah).\n\n==See==\n===Historic sites===\nMany historic sites require an entrance fee. There is a combined (adult) ticket for all sights (mostly Citadel, Knights Hall and Templar Tunnel) for ₪62 including the Turkish bath and ₪40 without it available. Students, disabled people or children pay between 20-40% less.\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Holy sites===\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Other sites===\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Do==\n\n* Take a boat ride around the walls of the old city.\n* Relax on the beach north of the old city.\n\n==Buy==\n\n==Eat==\nYou can find delicious hummus throughout Akko, and baklava in the old bazaar. One of the best hummus you can eat in Israel is at \"Hummus Sa'id\" in the Old City, but don't be too late - as soon as the hummus is finished the restaurant closes, usually at about 13:00-14:00. \n\nAkko is famous for its fish restaurants serving regional (Middle Eastern and Mediterranean) side dishes. Some of the best are located in the port area, Donyana and Abu Khristo are popular for those seeking a great meal in a great location overlooking the sea. Farther north is a local branch of the renowned Arab restaurant El-Babur, spacious and elegant (for its moderate prices) with an up-close view of the sea.\n\nThe restaurants along the beach area are very good, even though some of them may be expensive. In Salah ad Din Street there is a small bakery with classic Arab sweet pastries featuring honey and nuts. \n\nIf you are looking for an upscale menu, just north of the lighthouse on the coast promenade (Hahagana Street) is Uri-Buri, named for its chef and rated one of Israel's Top Ten seafood restaurants. Next to it with a similar menu is Beit Maha that is also a great coffee bar.\n\nA little far away from the crowds of the Old City is the locals favorite Gallery Simaan restaurant, located on Ben Ami street (no. 63).\n\n==Drink==\n\n==Sleep==\nDecent and at the same time inexpensive accommodation options are sparse in Akko.\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n==Go next==\n* Haifa &amp;ndash; The second-holiest city in the Bahai faith, including its great garden down the northern slope of the city.\n* Nazareth &amp;ndash; The largest Arab city in Israel and best known as the boyhood home of Jesus of Nazareth.\n* Tiberias &amp;ndash; A large Israeli town in the east and great starting point for the Sea of Galilee region|Sea of Galilee and Golan Heights.\n* Nahariyya &amp;ndash; A beach town founded in 1934 by German Jews fleeing Nazi oppression.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Akron is proud of its heritage as a center of industry, and now offers visitors a wide range of recreational and cultural attractions, food experiences, and shopping. \n\n==Understand==\n\nAkron is called the ''City of Invention'' but used to be known as the ''Rubber Capital of the World'', and before that, as the original home of Quaker Oats, and before that, as a pottery works. It was built right on the southern edge of the '''Connecticut Western Reserve'''. It is on the shortest possible line drawn between the Cuyahoga River (connecting to the Great Lakes - Lake Erie), and the Tuscarawas River (connecting to the Ohio River and ultimately to the Gulf of Mexico.) The Portage Path, the shortest path for carrying a canoe from one water shed to the next, has connected the two since time immemorial, and is the primary reason Akron grew just where it did.\n\n===Visitor information===\n* \n\n==Get in==\n\n\n\n===By plane===\n*  | url=http://www.akroncantonairport.com/ | email=\n| address=5400 Lauby Rd NW | lat=40.916111 | long=-81.442222 | directions=\n| phone=+1 330-499-4221 | tollfree= | fax=\n| hours= | price=\n| wikipedia=Akron–Canton Airport | wikidata=Q954097\n| content=The most convenient airport, small, easy to navigate, quick in-and-out.\n}}\n*  | url=http://akronfultonairport.com/ | email=\n| address= | lat=41.0375 | long=-81.466944 | directions=\n| phone= | tollfree=\n| hours= | price=\n| wikidata=Q4059807\n| lastedit=2019-12-05\n| content=A large General aviation airport.

It is on the southwestern side of Santorini and though it offers great view of the caldera and volcano, it is not as overrun by tourists like Fira and Oia (Greece)|Oia. It has become famous by the discovery of an ancient Minoan settlement just outside the modern town.\n\n==Understand==\nAkrotiri is about 15 km south of Fira, on the south-western tip of Thira, the largest island of the Santorini archipelago. Built on the slopes of a hill, it is a popular travel destination because it offers spectacular views of the caldera. The top of the hill also features ruins of a 13th century Venice|Venetian castle, constructed as a defensive fortification to protect Thira from raiders. Most of the modern town is built around the castle ruins.\n\nWhat Akrotiri is perhaps the most famous for is the Minoan Bronze Age settlement that was discovered 2 km to the south-east of the current town. When the Santorini volcano obliterated the former island and created the present day archipelago in ca. 1600 BCE, the Minoan settlement was buried in volcanic pumice and ashes. As a result, it was exceptionally well preserved, unlike other Minoan settlements in the Cyclades, and the Akrotiri archaeological site is considered the most valuable Minoan era scientific evidence because it was covered at the height of the Minoan civilisation. The comparison with Pompeii is often made, and rightfully so. Many artefacts were unearthed in the ruins of the Minoan town but no bodies were discovered, which suggests the Minoans had evacuated prior to the eruption.\n\n==Get in==\n.\n\nThere are direct bus services from the Fira central bus station, which stop in the town centre (get off at |lat=36.35836|long=25.39893}}) and also directly to the  where services terminate.\n\n==Get around==\n\nAkrotori is small enough to get around by foot, even the lighthouse at cape Akrotiri can be reached within an hour walking.

There have been traces of a prehistoric settlement, but it wasn’t until 1967 when the excavations at the so-called ancient Akrotiri started. The most important excavations, which brought to light multi-level buildings and masterpiece-wall paintings, were conducted by the archaeologist Spryridon Marinatos, a professor at the University of Athens. This is one of the best preserved sites all over Greece, and we owe that to the same factor that caused its destruction. After the eruption of the volcano in the 17 century BC, the whole island, and Akrotiri as well, has been covered with volcanic material. This material has, however, played a major role in the protection of the ancient settlement and especially its wall paintings. The Bronze Age remains are the most popular archaeological site on the Santorini archipelago. The entire site is covered with a giant canopy, which collapsed in 2005 and killed a tourist.

The only stop with a pier is Akrotiri so if you intend to get off, tell them explicitly or they won't know to stop (though they often ask) and be prepared to get off directly into the sea and walk through the water to get to the beach. They always stop in waters shallow enough to walk in for adults (highest it comes to is the waist) so it is possible to bring bags, but make sure you can lift them above your head.\n*  - \n| lastedit=2022-04-08\n| content=Horse riding excursions in south Thira, including the famed black sand beaches.\n}}\n\n==Buy==\n* \n* \n* \n\n==Eat==\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Drink==\n* \n\n==Sleep==\n* \n*\n* \n| lastedit=2022-04-08\n| content=Hotel in a quiet location with 55 rooms and suites, 2 pools, taverna, pool-bar, and a travel agency.\n}}\n*\n*\n* \n| lastedit=2022-05-06\n| content=Private accommodation with caldera view.\n}}\n* \n| lastedit=2022-05-06\n| content=Private rooms around a swimming pool at the highest point of the Akrotiri hill, offering an incredible view over the caldera and Nea Kameni.

                    "text": "\n'''Aksaray''' is a city in Central Anatolia, 240 km southeast of Ankara and about 50 km west of Cappadocia. In 2021 the city had a population of 247,147, with another 68,000 living in the small towns and villages of Aksaray Province.\n\nAksaray is highly underrated—it is lively and authentic with barely any tourists, cheap accommodation and countless interesting sights around.\n\n== Understand ==\nCappadocia was a Persian kingdom from 331 BC to 17 AD and its last independent ruler Archelaus thought it would be neat if this town was named Archelaïs. He was unpopular with his subjects and ran out of money - the Romans invited him to Rome to discuss ways they could help, and when they'd done discussing, Archelaus was mysteriously dead. So the Romans took over the territory and renamed the town Colonia, just so everyone understood their status.\n\nThe town was on the Silk Road, the trading highway to Konya from the east of the country, and away over the far mountains from Persia. It came under the rule of the Seljuks from the 11th century, who adorned it with their distinctive architecture, building stout caravanserai to protect the travelling traders. The next brief dynasty was the Karamanids, then the Ottomans won it in 1470. By then the town had its present name of Aksaray meaning \"white palace\", of which no trace remains. Many residents relocated to Constantinople at that time, so there's a neighbourhood of Aksaray in present-day Istanbul.\n\nLater trade was of salt (essential in the days before refrigeration) harvested from the great salt lake to the north. Aksaray today is an industrial town that you pass through on the road to Cappadocia but don't linger.\n\n== Get in ==\n\n===By bus===\n* \n\nBuses from Istanbul run every hour or so via Gebze and Ankara, taking 10 hours for a single fare in 2022 of 300 TL. (From Ankara takes 3 hr 30 min.) These buses continue via Konya and Isparta to Antalya, another 9 hours.\n\nBuses from Izmir run every hour or two via Uşak, Afyon and Konya to Aksaray; from Konya takes 2 hours. They continue across Cappadocia via Nevşehir, Göreme and Avanos to Kayseri.\n\nFrom Nevşehir bus station (west of town) a local minibus is no more than about €3 (50 TL as of May 2022). Larger bus companies will also take you along the ride, just don't pay more than for the minibus. Get off near the center of Aksaray, not at the bus station.\n\n===By road===\nBy road from Istanbul head east past Ankara onto O-21 towards Adana. Exit at Acıkuyu onto D757 / D750 into town. D300 is the east-west highway Kayseri-Cappadocia-Aksaray-Konya. D750 south eventually rejoins O-21.\n\n===By train===\nThere is no railway service to Aksaray. YHT fast trains run from Istanbul to Ankara and Konya.\n\n== Get around ==\nIt would make sense to rent a car (check Google Maps and ratings), but as soon as you are out of the city hitchhiking is also possible. So, it can be a good idea to rely on buses and your thumb if you are not in too much of a hurry.\n\n* \n* \n\n== See ==\n* \n* '''Governor's Office''' and other handsome early Republican buildings are in the square 200 m southwest of Grand Mosque. The street on the square's north flank is optimistically called Turizm Cd.\n* \n* '''Kılıçaslan Hamams''' are 12th century bath houses on the riverbank opposite Red Minaret Mosque.

Access is free, you can buy overpriced salt and soap but that's better bought in town and comes from the same place. Don't pay for cleaning your feet, just walk straight out to the bus park, where you will find plenty of water for cleaning the buses. Wear good shoes and sunglasses as the glare from the saltpan intensifies the sunlight.\n}}\n* \n*  further east of Kaman.\n| phone= | tollfree=\n| hours=Daily 08:00-19:00 | price=Museum: 20 TL as of 2022\n| wikidata=Q10839246\n| lastedit=2023-03-31\n| content=The wonderful [http://www.kaman.gov.tr/japon-bahcemiz Prince Mikasa Memorial Garden] (free entry), a hillside Japanese gardens|Japanese garden combining all traditional design elements.

It is famous for its stelae, churches, monasteries, tombs and the ruins of palaces and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage List|UNESCO World Heritage site in 1980.\n\nIt is one of the cleaner and better kept Ethiopian towns with cobbled side streets and attractive flame trees providing shade in the main street.\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By plane===\nGiven the often trying conditions of Ethiopian roads, flying into Axum is a much more reasonable option.\n*  | url= | email=\n| address= | lat=14.136944 | long=38.776111 | directions=7&amp;nbsp;km to the east of town\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\n| hours= | price=\n| wikipedia=Axum Airport | image=Aksúmské letiště.jpg | wikidata=Q2469695\n|lastedit=2023-06-24| content=There are daily flights from Addis Ababa, Gondar and Lalibela. Some flights are direct, others make stops along the way. At the airport, there will be taxis eager to drive you into town. A minibus is 75 birr per person (May 2019) and takes 15 minutes. Many hotels also offer van service to and from the airport.  As of June 2023, the airport is closed due to the recent conflict, but is expected to open in a month or so.\n}}\n* Shire Airport. 1 hour drive\n* Mekele Airport. 4 hour drive\n\nIt is likely that you will be security checked 3 times before getting onto your flight out of Yohannes IV/Axum Airport - as there is a security check on the road to the airport, a security check as you enter the airport and a security check after check-in.\n\n===By bus===\nBuses from Addis Ababa take a minimum of three days to travel via Dessie and Mekele.  It is a very taxing ride over rough roads.\n\nFrom Gondar, take the dawn bus to Shire (aka Inda Silasie) and change there for Axum – you can get through in a day. The section from Debarik/Debark to Inda Aba Guna (70&amp;nbsp;km before Shire) is one of the most spectacular in Africa, and used to be very rough, but most of it was paved by the end of 2017. From Shire to Axum is another 90 minutes on tarmac.\n\nFrom Debarik and the Simien National Park|Simien Mountains, the only bus heading north to Shire is the one from Gondar. It is often already full when it arrives at Debarik.  You can either take your chances (it isn't always full), or hire someone from Debarik for about 150 birr to go into Gondar the day before and ride the Shire bus to Debarik for you, guaranteeing you a seat. (You must make arrangements the morning prior to the day you want to leave.  If you are going trekking, you can make arrangements before you leave for your trek.)  There are many buses travelling between Shire and Axum.\n\nTo travel the other way, from Axum to Gondar, you must take an afternoon bus to Shire/Inda Silasie, spend the night there, and catch the dawn bus to Gondar. You can get off at Debarik, but you will probably have to pay the full Gondar fare (about 50 birr).\n\nThe bus station is about 25 minutes walk east from Ezana park in the middle of town. The bus station is well organised and opens at 6PM sharp. It is as well to be there for the first bus if you are travelling any distance.\n\n===By shared car===\nIt is possible to get to Axum from Addis Ababa in one long day (and vice-versa), though two days is more likely.  Drivers can be arranged through hotels or touts and, while not certainly the cheapest option (especially if you are able to take advantage of the Ethiopian Airlines discounts), can be faster and/or more comfortable than other means of public transportation.\n\n==Get around==\n\nBajaj (blue, three-wheeler motorised rickshaws with 250cc two-stroke engines imported from India) charge tourists about 20 birr for short trips around town. For the Lioness of Gobodra and the Judith (Gudit) Stelae Field, instead of hiring one of the ultra-expensive tourist minibuses, you can catch a minibus going in the direction of Shire (there are many early in the morning) and ask them to drop you at the Lioness of Gobodra turnoff and catch another one back. The Lioness is not easy to find on your own but a group of children will soon appear who will guide you, and they should be compensated appropriately.\n\n==See==\n\n\nImage:Aksum church.jpg|thumb|Chapel of the Tablet, at the Cathedral of Saint Mary of Zion\n\nAn combined archaeological ticket costs 300 birr (May 2019). Tickets are available from the tourist commission off the roundabout 400&amp;nbsp;m south of the Northern Stelae Field is valid for three days.\n\n'''Northern Stelae Field''' contains numerous stelae, including the fallen Giant Stele and the standing Ezana Stele and Obelisk of Axum, tombs and a very worthwhile museum.\nThe monolithic stelae are fashioned out of solid granite. Their mystery lies in that it is not known exactly by whom and for what purpose they were fashioned, although they were likely associated with burials of great emperors. The Ezana Stele, which measures 24 metres (78 feet) high, is standing at a slight lean in the centre of the field and is supported as a precaution against toppling. Another stele, the Obelisk of Axum, 24.8 metres (80 feet) high, fell while the tombs were being pillaged around the 10th century AD. It was stolen by the invading forces of Fascist Italy and taken to Rome, where it stood, from 1937 to 2005. It was returned to Axum and re-erected between the Ezana Stele and the Giant Stele in 2008.\n\nThe Great Stele, the biggest monolith in the world, measuring over 33 metres (108 feet) in length and weighing over 500 tonnes, fell somewhere around the 4th century AD and now lies in broken fragments on the ground.\nThe mausoleum and the tomb of the brick walls are now open to the public again. The Tomb of the False Door is very impressive with its accurate workmanship.\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n=== Churches and monasteries ===\n\nA churches ticket costs 200 birr (May 2019). The combined ticket enables entry to the St Mary of Zion complex and to Arabtu Ensessa Church which is close by.\n\n* \n* \n* \n*\n\n* '''Ezana park''' contains a series of ''al fresco'' billiard tables and, in a circular building that looks padlocked but maybe isn't, another tablet from the time of King Ezana inscribed in Ge'ez, Greek and Sabaean.\n\n==Do==\nAccording to the sign by the fig tree near the churches complex, a replica Ark of the Covenant is paraded on the first seven days of each month according to the Ethiopian calendar, at 21:00. This means 03:00 by the standard clock. Other sources say 05:00 but nothing was happening at 05:00 GMT+3 on 3 May 2019. Even if you don't get to see the Ark of the Covenant just sitting under the fig tree is a must do activity.\n\n==Buy==\nThere is an ATM that accepts Visa cards at Wegagen Bank.\n\n==Eat==\n* \n*'''Africa Hotel''' (see the #Sleep|'''''Sleep''''' section below) has a large, clean restaurant where a steak club sandwich with lettuce and tomato together with chips cost 30 birr in June 2013. Traditional and other \"international\" dishes are also served and their bar has a large screen LCD TV if you want to watch some soccer or the manic, shoulder-shaking style of the local dances.\n*'''Pizza Restaurant''', ''turn north one block east of the Africa Hotel into the street that leads to the Remhai Hotel and this small place is on the right of the street.'' A large pizza, \"but-not-as-we-know-it-in Italy, Croatia, Canada or Singapore\", cost 60 birr in June 2013.\n*'''Kuda juice''' is a fun place to eat is local food, Italian food and even some Mexican.

While the city itself is relatively young, there is a number of ancient historical and nature sites of significance that can be visited in the area.\n\nMangystau translates roughly from Kazakh as \"eternal mountains\", although the region is actually home to the Karagiye Depression - one of the lowest points in the world at 130&amp;nbsp;meters below sea level.  The region is also home to Sufi-pilgrimage sites such as Beket-Ata, Shakpak-Ata, Shopan-Ata and Masat-Ata, which exist due to Mangystau's location on ancient, but minor, land trading routes around the Caspian.  The region is also home to some minor, albeit beautiful, natural attractions such as \"Fire Mountain\" (Kazakh: Отпантау), oases Tamshali and Saura, and Radon Hot Springs and Mudbaths.  The Mangystau region is principally populated by Kazakhs of the Aday Tribe, which is one of the \"little brother\" tribes in Kazakh history.\n\nAktau was created as a uranium mining town in 1961 and was named Shevchenko, after the Ukrainian national poet Taras Hryhorovych Shevchenko (Ukrainian: Тара́с Григо́рович Шевче́нко). The Soviets built a major nuclear power plant and desalinization plant and the desert was transformed into a livable city.  After independence, the Kazakhs renamed Shevchenko, and the city has become Kazakhstan's only port.  Due to the large amount of oil and gas exported from Kazakhstan, the city has boomed and is now home to many new developments, which have stretched the infrastructure to its breaking point.\n\nIf you come to this city, you will be able to experience the paradox of large supplies of hydrocarbons, uranium and seawater coupled with frequent brown-outs and water shortages.\n\n===People===\nThe Aday people are the overwhelming majority of Kazakhs who live in or near Aktau.  This tribe of people usually describe themselves as fierce and prone to fighting while at the same time friendly and generous to guests.\n\nEthnic groups from across the Caspian populate Aktau as well.  Most of these people were born in violent areas of Dagestan, Ingushetia, Chechnya or Ossetia and have wild stories if you are willing to listen.  Groups here include Chechnyans, Utis, Lezgins, and Ingush.  Many taxi drivers are Azeri or Georgian with a handful of Russians also present.  People whose parents were born in other parts of the former Soviet Union live here.  These groups include Koreans from Vladivostok, Ukrainians and Belarussians.  The largest expat community are Italians due to the presence of Agip and Saipem.\n\n==Get in==\n\n\n===By plane===\nAktau Airport is 24 km north of the city center. Taxi drivers usually wait for arriving passengers in the arrivals area of the airport. Haggle and a taxi should cost no more than 2000 tenge one way. It may be worth organising a pick-up by your hotel, ensuring the taxi driver knows where he's going and at a set cost.\n\nPublic buses go from outside the airport terminal to the centre of Aktau and are a cheaper alternative to  taxis.  The fare in March 2024 was 70 Tenge.  Timetables and the route map are available on Yandex maps, and you can also pay using the Kaspi pay app. The last bus to the airport departs Aktau at 9:00 p,m,\n\nThe '''cheapest''' way to fly to Aktau is with the SCAT or Azerbaijan Air from Baku or Tbilisi. Prices (June 2022) are about US$100 one way.\nAlso weekly flights from and to Gorgan, Iran .\nDirect domestic flights include: Atyrau (SCAT and Astana Air several times per day), Almaty (Astana Air or SCAT once a day) and sometimes Aktobe (SCAT).\n\nSCAT airlines also offers direct flights from Shymkent for $75 USD (booked December 2019).\n\nDirect international flights include Moscow (Transaero), Istanbul or Tbilisi (SCAT). Air Astana has a service to Amsterdam through a partnership with KLM.  In addition to these regular flights, there are sporadic flights with SCAT and other local airlines to Makhachkala, Yerevan and Astrakhan.  There is a direct charter flight to Urumqi departing on the 15th of every month and returning around the 20th of the same month.\n\n===By train===\nAll trains arrive and depart from the Mangyshlak/Mangystau (Мангышлак) Station, about  from central Aktau.  There is a regular 24-hour train service to and from Atyrau.  There is also a train from Nukus (departs 20:15, takes 19 hours), a two-day-long train service from Astana, and a three-day-long train service from Almaty, passing through Shymkent two days after departing Aktau. \n\nPlentiful taxis are available right outside the train station to take you to Aktau. Alternatively bus #105 leaves from the main road outside the station. It runs every 10 minutes until 8:00 p.m. There's an onboard conductor who can take payment in cash or by card. The bus fare to Aktau is 95 Tenge when paying by card, and 160 in cash (September 2024). The buses are modern and air-conditioned.  Because they are so frequent, they are unlikely to be packed, even just after a train has arrived.\n\n===By ferry===\n\n\nThe 'Baku-Aktau' ferry in fact travels from Alat to Kuryk -- both ports a considerable distance outside their nominal city.\n\n==Get around==\nAktau is the type of city U2 may have been talking about when they sang about a place where the streets have no names. The city is divided up into largely unlabeled and chaotically numbered districts (including district 9). These are called \"micro-raion\" in Russian, which even Kazakhs use to describe them in Kazakh.\n\nAddresses in Aktau are generally written as follows: 14-42-30, where 14 indicates the district, 42 indicates the apartment or commercial building and 30 indicates the apartment number. '''House numbering is not sequential.''' Building numbers are marked based on history of construction or clockwise around the block.\n\n'''City bus fares''': 50 tenge. Flag fare for taxis should be 200-400 tenge to anywhere within the city center, but this is often 300 tenge for foreigners.  Most cars in Aktau will stop and pick you up informally and there is no need to wait for an official taxi to pass by.  Official taxi drivers are usually from the Caucasus, and they rarely speak English or any other Western European language.  Locals driving newer cars are a better bet if you aren't comfortable communicating in Russian or Kazakh.  When you get in the car, you can simply say 'micro-raion' and then state the district's number in Russian.  Afterwards, say the building (\"Zdanie\" or apartment building \"Dom\") followed by the number.\n\nIf you should choose to experience a decrepit form of transportation, you can pay 50 tenge for '''buses'''.  You will see them plowing their routes on the three main roads in Aktau (north and south coastal, middle north and south road, and the eastern north and south road).\n\nUseful map of Aktau available here: http://www.aktau-business.com/gmap/\nMap includes a lot of helpful marks like hotels, cultural centres, markets, cafe, restaurants, tourist's companies, plain &amp; train tickets etc.\n\n==See==\nThere is a Soviet-era plane on a pedestal just down the hill from the Asian-themed World War II memorial.  At this memorial, an eternal flame (Russian: Вечный Огонь) burns under a circle of partial-white arches, which are reminiscent of a yurt.  Across from the memorial, there is a drama theater with regular productions in Russian.\n\nJust south of these structures, on Aktau's middle north-south thoroughfare, you will find a collection of restaurants, night clubs and shopping centers.  A well-appointed grocery store (Ramstor), movie theater and night club are in the Ardager shopping complex (district 9).  Beyond that, in the furthest shopping center to the south is \"Shoom\" (ШУМ) (district 4), which has a large variety of low-quality stores.\n\nTo the north, in district 16, you can find Aktau's new mall.  The mall includes a very small ice-skating rink, movie theater and a number of low and high quality shops (low quality children's clothes on the top floor, Hugo Boss on the main floor).  The mall includes arguably the best deal in town for food at Asorti on its top floor.\n\nDistrict 10 has little of note, but it serves as a great viewing point of the huge frescoes, which cover one side of decrepit Soviet apartment buildings across the main street in district 9.  The frescoes depict various \"national fathers\" of Kazakhstan, and rumor has it that current president Nursultan Abishuly Nazarbayev is keen to have his picture painted in a similar fashion.  For now, there is an enormous banner draped over an apartment building on that row.\n\n==Do==\nThe beaches of Aktau have nice water, and you are allowed to swim anywhere.  However, the amount of glass on the beaches can make your beach experience dicey in many locations. Watch out for water snakes in the more rocky parts.  Usually, the locals stick to the beaches below the Renaissance.  Behind the beach-side grills and clubs there, the beaches are fairly clean and sandy.\n\nUnfortunately you cannot kick back just anywhere on the edge of the Caspian, or around the town for that matter, and down a sunset drink.  You are not allowed to drink alcohol outside of these beach-side bar and grills, although there are absolutely no signs to warn you otherwise.  The local police take advantage of this situation and the general fear that many tourists have are the corrupt policemen.  If you are caught drinking, they only want 1000 tenge as a bribe, even if you don't speak Russian or Kazakh.  Most of the locals drinking on the street are ignored by police or pay the small bribe.\n\nBowling and pool are very popular in the city.  There are at least 2 bowling alleys of good quality:  just down the steps from the Soviet plane is Alia Bowling Hall (in between districts 7 and 9) and in Aktau Mall (district 16).  Pool is available at those places and in Elite Alliance (building 38 in district 8) in two places:  near the corner of the main road in the small Baiterek Center and one directly behind the building in between Elite Alliance and apartment building 7.  Nautilus Restaurant also offers pool.\n\nBeach volleyball is available in the summers at Aktau Mall sports center in district 16 and on the beach near the Renaissance Hotel.\n\nGrand Hotel Victory will let you use its saunas, gym, Turkish baths, etc. for one day for 4000 tenge.\n\n==Buy==\nThe prices in Aktau are high even by Western European standards.  Quality electronics, clothes, western-style foods, hotels, entertainment and gyms are readily available.  However, all of these are marked up anywhere from 100 to 300% above American or German prices.  It is best to go local in Aktau and/or buy anything of any consequence before you come.\n\nThere are a few bazaars in Aktau.  All of them have bad reputations for fleecing foreigners:  Yellow Bazaar (Жёлтый Рынок) in district 31, Wave Bazaar (рынок Волна) in district 5, Old Bazaar (Старый Базар) in district 22, and White Bazaar in district 8 (Ак Базар).\n* \n\n==Eat==\n* Shwarma places behind Ardager (Ардагәр) Mall, near the eternal flame memorial.  Ask for a 350 tenge shwarma without sauce (\"bez sousa\" or \"bez mayonez\") if you don't want it swimming in mayonnaise.\n* '''Japanese''' CIS style is available at Le Sushi Aktau at Astana Mall, the Jazz Club in district 5 or Restobar TOFU Aktau in district 7a. You should expect to pay at least US$10 to have a couple of small roleLls at any of those places.\n* '''Chinese''' is available at Steak House Napoli Chinatown (Napoli Rest) Restaurant at the Astana Mall for around 1500 tenge per person. \n* '''Korean''' is also available at Restobar TOFU Aktau in district 7a.\n* '''Italian''' also available at Napoli Rest, along with hookah (Russian: кальян) available.\n* \n\n* \n* Caucasian grilled meat (shashlik) is available at the beach-side grills below the Renaissance hotel.  These are usually 800-1500 tenge per person.\n\n==Drink==\n* The English Pub at the 5 Star Hotel \"Grand Victory\" in district 13 has a laid-back atmosphere and comfortable seats, but charges US$5-8 per pint.\n* \n* \n* The beach-side bars near Renaissance offer nightlife similar to that at Fuenta, but they mostly shut during the winter.\n* Restaurant Pinta has occasional ballroom dancing parties on Sunday evenings.\n* \n\n==Sleep==\n\n=== Hotels ===\n==== Budget====\n* \n\n==== Mid-range/Splurge ====\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n=== Budget ===\n* A cheaper and more personal alternative to hotel accommodation might be renting a room or flat from locals. There should be listings online (in Russian). A tested option is offered by Viktor and Svetlana, a friendly middle-aged couple who rent out their spare flat in an aging but charming communist-era block in the 'historic' (1960s) part of the city centre. Basic facilities include a small kitchen (gas stove, pots, plates etc., but no fridge), warm shower, and a bed big enough for two plus couch. The price is only a few dollars per night. Located within walking distance from the city centre, at microrayon 2 (near Hotel Aktau). Phones: (+7) 7292 509276 (home) and (+7) 701 39665 54 (mobile). They speak Russian, very basic English and very, very basic French and Italian.\n\n==Connect==\n\nAs of September 2024, Aktau has 4G from all Kazakh carriers. The signal is patchy on the approach highways.\n\n==Go next==\nOther than buses to even more remote outposts in the desert, Aktau is an extremely out-of-the-way place, so getting out of town usually means backtracking in the direction you have just come.  Also, the situation with Turkmeni visas has not been investigated well or at all by any of the travel agencies in Aktau.  Therefore, you should not plan to come here first before getting a visa to continue to Turkmenistan.  If you do have a Turkmeni visa that authorizes a crossing from Mangystau to Turkmenbashi, then you can make your way easily to the border.  There are frequent morning buses to Zhanaozen (about 140&amp;nbsp;km east of Aktau) and then at least one daily bus from there to Turkmenbashi (about 300&amp;nbsp;km south).\n\nTourist agencies in town can make arrangements for visits to Suni shrines and very distant caravansarais.\n\nThe most famous of these shrines is '''Beket Ata''' - which is not very old - but already has many superstitions about magical properties of the site.  Built into a cave, this shrine to an 18th-century Kazakh wise man is usually visited in groups.  First, you will drive 3–5&amp;nbsp;hours from Aktau on poorly paved or unpaved roads to reach the shrine of Shapak Ata (mentor of Beket).  After visiting Shapak Ata you will travel another 30&amp;nbsp;minutes to Beket Ata.  You will need to take a live goat with your tour group that will be sacrificed later that evening.  After consecrating the goat, you will feast on the meat and relax and pray in the dormitories next to the site until very early the next morning.  At that point, you will get back on your tour bus with the leftovers and drive back to Aktau.\n\n'''Radon Hot Springs''' offers a slightly radioactive relaxation experience.  It is a very primitive location that is about 54&amp;nbsp;km south of Aktau, with 13&amp;nbsp;km of that journey offroad.  The hot springs are free, but room or yurt rental will cost 500 tenge per hour.  The facilities are very primitive (no electricity, no restaurant, no potable water nor western toilets or toilet paper) so you have to take everything with you.  There are mudbaths about 3&amp;nbsp;km beyond Radon on a nearby dirt road.  In both cases, you ''must'' have a local guide as the roads are completely unmarked and hazardous to drive on at night and there is no public transportation.\n\n'''Samal/Sherkala''', 150&amp;nbsp;km from Aktau, is an area formed by extreme geological instability.  Although Aktau does not experience earthquakes now, it used to have extreme earthquakes millions of years ago.  These resulted in the created of the big depression north of the city as well as the valley of Samal.  This valley is under \"Black Mountain\" (Каратау) and \"Fire Mountain\" (Отпантау).  The fire mountain has a natural eternal flame on top as well as a monument to wolves.  Nearby, the holy mountain of Sherkala attracts the superstitious who believe circumambulating the mountain between 1 and 7 times will result in good luck.  You will need locals to show you how to get there as nothing is signposted and there is no public transportation.\n\n'''Fort Shevchenko''' has nothing of historical or cultural note save that Mr. Shevchenko stayed there during his exile from Ukraine.  It is about 150&amp;nbsp;km north of Aktau and some buses leave district 8 infrequently to get there.  This is one of the few signposted locations in Mangystau.\n\nTwo desert oases are within reach of Aktau by day trip.  '''Saura''' is about 50&amp;nbsp;km north and '''Tamshali''' is about 130&amp;nbsp;km northeast.  You will need locals to show you how to get there as nothing is signposted and there is no public transportation.\n\nTo travel further east to the Silk Road cities in Uzbekistan trains travel from the Mangystau Station through Beyneu and on to Nukus in Uzbekistan, taking around 29 hours. From there it is possible to travel on to Samarkand and Tashkent.\n\n\n\n\n"

Akumal is one of the most peaceful places in the Riviera Maya one protected shallow bay with a secluded beach and a nearby reef.\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By plane===\n\nThe nearest Airport to Akumal is the Cancún International Airport. You could also check flights to the Cozumel airport.\n\n====From the Cancun airport====\n\nOne way to get there is by pre-booking a private transfer from the airport.\n\nThere are also buses and shuttles with some hotels or dive shops offering free shuttles.\n\nFrom the airport you can also take the ADO bus to Playa del Carmen (Terminal Turistica) for M$216 (Feb 2022). And from there a second class Mayab or Oriente bus, which stops for you at the Highway 307 at Akumal, for about M$40 (Feb 2022).\n\n====From the Cozumel airport====\n\nTake a taxi for the 2.5 km to the ferry. Take the ferry to Playa del Carmen for US$13 (Feb 2022). At the ferry is the Bus Terminal Turistica. Take a second class Mayab or Oriente bus to the Highway 307 at Akumal for about M$40 (Feb 2022).\n\n===By intercity bus===\nFrom Cancun, Playa del Carmen, Tulum, Bacalar or Chetumal take a second class Mayab or Oriente bus to the Highway 307 at Akumal.\n\n===By shared van===\n\nA cheap option is to take a colectivo. From Tulum they depart a half block away from the ADO bus station and cost about M$35 (Jan 2022) to Akumal. From Playa del Carmen they leave around Parque Leona Vicario and cost M$45 (2019). If entering from Cancún you can take a colectivo from the ADO bus station to Playa del Carmen for M$50 (Feb 2022), and then switch. In Playa del Carmen arrives the colectivo from Cancún where the colectivo to Akumal departs. In the colectivos you cannot take much luggage with you as there is no car trunk.\n\n===By car===\n\nIt is approximately a one-hour drive from Cancun.\n\nImage:Akumal Bay.jpg|thumb|350px|Akumal Bay\n\n==Get around==\nThere are ''colectivos'', a local 15-passenger van service that runs between Playa del Carmen and Tulum on the Highway 307. They cost about M$35 (Mexico#Currency|pesos, Feb 2022) per person and run very frequently. You can catch the colectivos off the main highway. If you are standing on the side of the highway the driver will flash his lights at you if he has room in his van.  This is the preferred local way of getting around.\n\nThere is parking available at the beach for M$50. Be careful with the people harassing tourists at the parking lot and pretending to be government officials, forcing their snokelling tour on you. The beach is free to use for everyone and a guide is not required if you're comfortable snorkeling on your own. Please follow the posted rules, however.\n\nThe closest sights are at least a 20-minute drive.  However, if you're not comfortable driving in a foreign country, there are plenty of taxis to take you wherever you need to go.\n\n==See==\n\nImage:Akumal Statue.JPG|thumb|250px|Statue in town\n\nAkumal has a beautiful bay with a wide white sand beach, wonderfully warm blue-green water and great snorkeling.  Cute little town with several restaurants.\n\n==Do==\n===Snorkeling===\nWith the destruction of hurricane Wilma, the reefs near Akumal were damaged.  However, a snorkeling trip is still very worth the time and expense.\nThere are three options for snorkeling:\n#Go on a tour provided by one of the two dive shops in town.  It is US$40 per person.\n#Go on an \"unofficial\" tour. If you stand on the beach with a clueless look on your face, a local may approach you and offer to take you snorkeling on his glass-bottomed boat. It is usually US$20 per person and includes snorkeling equipment.  The guide will attempt to find the famous sea turtles for you and show you different corals and fish.  Make sure you are comfortable swimming with flippers as the guide may swim quickly from site to site.\n#Rent or buy your own equipment and swim out alone. [http://www.akumaldivecenter.com/ Akumal Dive Center] rents equipment for 200 pesos.  The coral reefs are not too far from the shore and can be easily accessed by swimming, especially with the help of a life preserver.  Much of the bay is not more than five feet deep.  Be very careful to stay away from the \"fire reef\" marked with buoys and a distinctive red-colored coral.  It stings and excessive contact can be fatal.\nSince coral dies on human contact, you should avoid touching coral at all costs.  It is also illegal to touch the wildlife, such as the sea turtles, so please do not try to ride them or bother them in any way.\nAs of January 2006, there were five juvenile green sea turtles living in the bay.\n\n===Other===\n* '''Scuba diving'''.

The playing season is April-Sept. \n* You can also visit nearby farms, go horseback riding, etc. For more information and booking, visit '''Hof Cultural Center''' (see above) or '''Saga Travel''' (Kaupvangsstræti 4, , sagatravel@sagatravel.is).\n\n=== Diving ===\nNorthern Iceland offers special diving experience due to submerged geological formations and cold water marine life. The North Atlantic water is chilly all year round, suitable for dry suit diving. The minimum age for scuba diving is 17 years according to Icelandic laws.\n\nScuba divers can join various guided tours, the most special one to a submerged hydrothermal chimney Strýtan in the middle of Eyjafjörður is reserved for more experienced divers. This geothermal formation (white smoker) was created over 10.000 years ago and it is still active. The tallest of several chimneys rises from the sea bottom at the depth of 65 m to 15 m below sea level, and is continuously spewing hot water. Diving is permitted at this protected site with a guide. The local dive center owner is at the same time a discoverer of Strýtan and has in-depth knowledge of the local marine environment.\n\nArnarnesstrýtur dive site, a cluster of small hydrothermal chimneys at the sea bottom between 23 m and 15 m, is a wonderful alternative for less experienced divers. This dive location, accessible on a zodiac, is also full of rich marine life, with wolffish, cod, pollock or lumpfish, as well as diverse nudibranchs.\n\n* \n\n==Buy==\n'''Hafnarstræti''', in the city center, is Akureyri's main shopping street. Shops there include an , several souvenir shops, and the curiosity shop Frúin í Hamborg.\n\nFor local art and design, head to '''Grófargil''', colliqually known as '''Listagil''' (“art canyon”). It's a steep canyon by the street Kaupvangsstræti and home to several studios, galleries and shops.\n\nA small shopping mall, called , is a short distance north of the city centre. \n\nThere is a '''Nettó''' supermarket near the Glerártorg shopping mall. There is also a  supermarket near there, just a little further north along Glerágata/Hörgárbraut, and a  supermarket at Tryggvabraut 8. A  supermarket is located near the harbour, at Furuvellir 17.\n\n==Eat==\nWhile you're in Akureyri, be sure to get ice cream from the locally famous .\n\n=== Budget ===\nEating on a budget in Akureyri is about as difficult as in the rest of the country, though there are some options.\n\n* \n* \n* \n\nFor a quick snack, consider going to a hotdog stand such as the one on Hafnarstræti, opposite The Viking (souvenir store). Do as the Icelanders do and ask for ''eina með öllu'': one with everything. There are also several grocery stores in town such as Krónan.\n]\n=== Mid-range ===\n*\n*\n*\n* \n\n===Splurge===\n*\n* \n\n==Drink==\nA nice bar is across the street from the main movie theatre. It seems that people in the city enjoy an 'early' movie theater around 20:00 or so, and, as customary in Iceland, go clubbing/barhopping after midnight. Keep in mind that the clubs close at 01:00, at least during the weekdays. A strange wheel-of-fortune with shots, beer, and nothing, is there, for kr 1500.\n* \n\n==Sleep==\nThere are many guesthouses more inland immediately away from the city center. They double as residences for college students, but they are the cheapest lodging you'll find, at around kr 8000 double and kr 5000 single.\n\nIn addition to hostels and hotels, there are a variety of apartments to rent. These are usually set up like a conventional 1-bedroom apartment (with amenities like a refrigerator, kitchen, and dining area). You might prefer renting an apartment if you're staying in the area for multiple days and want to buy groceries and prepare your own meals.\n*\n*\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Learn==\n* \n\n==Connect==\nAkureyri has good mobile phone coverage (including 3G).

Several buses run mostly hourly from the city centre to other important places like the airport and neighboring settlements and bus tours are available which take you to see the enormous crater of Víti, and Goðafoss (waterfall of the gods).\n\nAkureyri is fairly close to Húsavík, which has several whale watching tour operators, and Dalvík, from where you'll be able to catch a ferry to the island of Grímsey, Iceland's northernmost inhabitated island, situated right on the Arctic Circle.\n\n*Akureyri to Myvatn (1 hr 30 min) kr 2400 / €16\n*Akureyri to Egilsstadir (3 hr 30 min) kr 7600 / €51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In addition to significant regional devotion to high-school football teams the entire state, in terms of college football, is divided into two factions: Auburn University fans and University of Alabama fans. The rivalry is so bitter, in fact, that it took an act by the Alabama State Legislature in the late 1940s to force the two colleges to play one another (the two had stopped playing each other in the first years of the 20th century over an officiating dispute).\n\nEven then, the two schools would not agree to play at opposing sites so the State of Alabama used taxpayer funds to build Legion Field in Birmingham as a neutral site. It was only in 1989 that the Crimson Tide finally visited Auburn and 2000 that the Tigers visited Alabama. This can also be a point of concern for tourists, as the rivalry is so serious that tourists are best not to mention it at all.\n\nAlabama is also noted for having the lengthiest constitution in the world. At nearly 300,000 words, the constitution is made up of nearly 946 amendments, and because of this, the state has numerous constitutional officers/administrators. Some aspects of the constitution are so complex that ordinary residents of the state can't accurately make out what certain statements in the constitution mean.\n\n===Climate===\n\nDue to its location in the Deep South, Alabama has a humid subtropical/continental climate. Summers are hot and humid, winters are cool to cold, and fall and spring offer pleasant temperatures.\n\n===Tourist information ===\n* [https://alabama.travel/ Alabama Tourism] website\n\n==Talk==\n\nMany (though certainly not all) Alabamians speak with thick local accents so non-native English speakers may have difficulty understanding them. Visitors to North Alabama (Birmingham and north) will experience accents that are more \"country\" in nature (Senator Richard Shelby is one example) while visitors to South Alabama (south of Birmingham) will experience accents that are more closely reminiscent of those from the 1939 film ''Gone With the Wind'' and the 1994 film ''Forrest Gump'', which takes place in Southern Alabama. Former governor Fob James is a textbook example of someone who speaks like this.\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By car===\nAlabama is accessible by five interstate highways: Interstate 10 (I-10) crosses the state from east to west near Mobile in the south; I-20 enters Alabama from the east, traverses Birmingham, and joins I-59 as it traverses Tuscaloosa and exits the state in a southwesterly direction; I-59 enters northeastern Alabama, continues southwest through Birmingham, and exits the state toward the southwest; I-22 enters Alabama from the northwest and ends in Birmingham; I-65 enters Alabama from the north, traverses Birmingham, and ends in Mobile; I-85 enters the state in the east and ends in Montgomery.\n\n===By bus===\n\n[http://www.greyhound.com/ Greyhound Lines] offers bus transportation to cities and towns throughout Alabama.

Interstates converge on Montgomery, Birmingham, and Mobile, and make quick transportation between those cities and ones in other states. They also connect to Anniston, Tuscaloosa, and Huntsville.

Over 200,000 people attend the festival annually and it has been ranked as one of the top twenty events in the southeast by the Southeast Tourism Society, and one of the top five in the state. 2016 will mark the 45th anniversary of this festival.\n*The [https://www.hangoutcookoff.com/ '''Oyster Cook-Off Craft Spirits &amp; Beer Weekend'''] has been a local staple in Gulf Shores for over a decade, featuring hundreds of food and beverage choices. The first week of November starts the cook-off, with Craft Beer tastings from breweries around the southeast, vast collections of rare spirits, and live music. The festival started humbly featuring master-grade oyster preparations alongside local farmers and has grown into a full fledged foodie festival featuring chefs of international acclaim and dishes well beyond the scope of oysters. It's a ticketed event, with a portion of sales going back to charitable causes.\n* Tuscumbia is home to the Helen Keller Festival. This outdoor event is held annually in June for three days (Friday to Sunday) and kicks off with a lengthy parade complete with floats and its riders throwing candy to bystanders, high school marching bands, horses, Civil War reenactors and Shriners zipping about in their miniature go-karts. Afterwards, Main Street is closed and is filled with local vendors selling everything from handmade crafts to fresh vegetables. An antique car show is also a highlighted feature. Many local and out of state bands perform throughout the day with at least one major performer, normally of the country music variety, performing Saturday night in Spring Park. Also performed at the birthplace of Helen Keller is a local production of the stage play ''The Miracle Worker'' which is a theatrical rendition of Helen Keller's childhood and interaction with Ann Sullivan. One little known fact about Helen Keller that most natives of Tuscumbia do not even realize is that she was an ardent and outspoken socialist during her adult life.\n\n===Sports===\n\n'''Talladega Super Speedway''' is in Talladega.\n\n====Collegiate====\nHome to what is considered one of the top rivalries in sports, the state of Alabama revolves around college football.

Don't forget to try local oyster bars, and the shrimp is superb. Ask locals for recommendations that are off the beaten path and area favorites.\n\nAlabama barbecue is outstanding and comes in many forms, but pork is always most popular. There are several award-winning barbecue \"joints\" in Alabama, and their claim to fame is typically \"pulled pork\", but they will offer ribs, too.\n\nFor dessert, look for pecan pie. During the summer, fresh peaches and blackberries are available. Fruit pies abound, and if you want something a little different, look for cobblers. Home-style peach ice cream is a particular treat.\n\n==Drink==\n*\n\n==Go next==\n\n* '''Mississippi''' - Alabama's neighbor to the west has Civil War battlefields, scenic parkways, and antebellum charm.\n* '''Tennessee''' - North of Alabama, Tennessee offers the cities of Memphis, Nashville, Knoxville, &amp; Chattanooga, plus the beautiful Great Smoky Mountains National Park|Great Smoky Mountains.\n* '''Georgia (state)|Georgia''' - On Alabama's eastern border, Georgia has the major metropolis of Atlanta, with many attractions, and the charming cities of Macon (Georgia)|Macon &amp; Savannah.\n* '''Florida''' - Bordering the southern part of the state is Florida, with a lot more gulf coast than Alabama, including fabulous beaches, the big tourist area of Orlando, and the cities of Tampa, Jacksonville, and Miami\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Walk through the gate and turn immediately left on the dirt road. At '''0.1''' (2) you come to an interpretive sign explaining the general features of the park.  Park brochures are available here. Pick one up as it will provide useful information on the things you will see along the way. The trail bends to the right here onto a slightly rougher surface, but it is still easy to walk.\n\nAt '''0.2''' you reach a trail junction (3). Go to the right. Another trail junction (4) is reached at '''0.3'''. There are restrooms here.  The trail to the right is the labelled \"Ala Hele Ike Hawai'i\" on the printed version of the park brochure and \"Ala Mauka-Makai\" on the online version.  Whatever the correct name of the trail, it leads to the visitor center. Turn left to head out onto the shore.\n\nFollow the shoreline to your right. At '''0.6''', by some interesting remains of structures in the water (5), the rocky shore gives way to a wide expanse of beach.  There will be a few beach-goers of various sorts here, but it is never crowded, even on a holiday long weekend. Choose your own way across the sand around the bay.  The sand is loose, and the slope of the beach is steep, leading to slow going. At '''0.7''' you reach 'Aimakapa Fishpond, (6) located behind the beach.  The beach dune is only a few feet high, but it shelters the pond, and can provide a huge contrast from the cool breezy environment of the shore. Watch for a variety of waterbirds on and around the pond.\n\nAt '''1.1''' there is an interesting structure in the lower side of the beach (7).  It's not clear what it is, but it appears to be more recent than the other ruins that abound in the park.  There appears to be a trail off the beach to the right here, but it dead-ends quickly.  Continue along the beach.  You finally reach the end of the beach at '''1.2''' (8).  The trail continues along the top of a square stone wall, then soon turns inland, entering the trees at (9).  Up to this point, any kind of footwear would be fine, but the trail now proceeds a distance on some loose lava rubble, and sturdy footwear is required.\n\nAt '''1.3''' you find a gap (10) in an old wall made of pieces of lava. The trail is unclear here.  Stay on the left (seaward) side of the wall.  While the trail winds in and out of the trees, there is a large field of 'a'a on your right.  This is a portion of the 1801 flow from the eruption of Hualalai.  There are many structures built within the lava field out of local chunks of lava. One is a long straight wall (11) running perpendicular to the trail at '''1.5'''.\n\nAn apparent trail junction is reached at '''1.7''' (12). Stay to the left.  A signed trail junction is found at '''1.9''' (13). The trail to the right is Ale Hele Hu'e Hu'e.  It connects to the Mamalahoa trail and can be used to form a loop through the visitor center parking lot. Continue straight ahead to stay on Ala Kahakai. Short trails giving access to the shoreline branch left at (14) and (15).\n\nAt '''2.3''' you reach the picnic area (16). There are restrooms here.  At the north end of the picnic area is an interpretive sign (17) describing the Kaloko Fishpond. Restoration of the retaining wall using traditional Hawai'ian methods is still in progress, but you may walk out onto the restored portion of the kuapa (fishpond wall) and marvel at its construction.  Because the wall is composed of unshaped lava rocks fitted together without mortar, there is the potential for the edges to be unstable.  For the sake of the integrity of the wall and your own safety, stay back from the edge.\n\nKaloko Fishpond is the northern turnaround point for this hike.  It would actually make a nicer starting and ending point than the way I have described this trail, but the access road is gravel, and therefore forbidden to almost all rental car users.  Retrace your steps now to waypoint (3). Along the way, you may have noticed a constant fringe of clouds and rain along the slopes of Hualalai. This is caused by daytime convection drawing cool, moist air off of the ocean as the sun warms the land, combined with the orographic lift effect of the mountain. It probably looks like it's going to rain on you at any minute, but it probably won't.\n\nWhen you reach (3), turn right to head out to Honokohau Beach and the 'Ai'opio Fishtrap.  The crumbling fishtrap walls create a sheltered lagoon that is protected from the surf, and therefore ideal for swimming.  The small beach here is usually more crowded than the larger beach you crossed earlier. As you enter the beach area, '''4.5''' from the start of the hike, you will see a Halau, or long house (18).  Continue around the beach to the Heiau (19), or temple. A traditional Hawai'ian altar stands here, and Hawai'ians often bring offerings to this traditionally sacred place.  Please be respectful.\n\nWhen you are ready, retrace your steps to waypoint (3) and keep right to return to the starting point, a total of '''5.1''' km.\n\n==Stay safe==\n\n==Go next==\n\n\n"

It is separated from the mainland by the '''Oakland Estuary'''. One can get there from Oakland very easily, by way of one of the bridges or the '''Webster Street Tube'''.\n\n\n==Understand==\n\nAlameda is an island city with a consciousness of its history. It was founded as a Spanish settlement and then became a Mexican one. Many of the streets and neighborhoods have names dating back to the 19th century. There are a great many large Victorian houses throughout the town, including the original '''Alameda Library''', '''Alameda City Hall''', the '''Elks Lodge''', and most particularly '''Historic Alameda High School'''. A few of the streets have been restored to Victorian grandeur, notably the shopping districts of '''Park Street''' and '''Webster Street'''. Once one of many of its kind, the '''Alameda Naval Air Station''' was decommissioned in 1997, and has since been the site of a few film and TV productions, in its present form, '''Alameda Point'''. Around the Christmas season, the residents of '''Thompson Street''' participate in lighting up the whole city block, houses and trees alike. The city is home to a single theater, the classic Art Deco '''Alameda Theatre''', built in 1932, renovated and expanded in 2008. South of the main island is '''Bay Farm Island''', a mostly-residential and markedly suburban district bordering '''Oakland International Airport'''.\n\n===Climate===\n &amp;#160;&amp;#160; Data from [http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/normals NOAA (1981-2010)]\n}}\n\n==Get in==\n\n\n\n===By plane===\n'''Oakland International Airport''' () is a close neighbor to Alameda. The traveller's best bet for getting into town is by public transit ('''[http://www.actransit.org/maps/schedule_results.php?version_id=21&amp;quick_line=21&amp;Go=Go AC Transit Line 21]'''). The easiest way for your money is likely to be a taxi, though the major (read: spendier) hotels of Oakland and Alameda offer free shuttle service to and from the airport.\n\n===By car===\nThe proximity of Alameda to Oakland makes access by car easy. From Webster, 29th Ave. or Fruitvale in Oakland, all exits are clearly marked. From '''I-880/The Nimitz Freeway''', the 23rd Ave. exit is easiest, and the exits leading to the island city are all clearly marked.\n\n===By ferry===\nThe '''[http://www.sanfranciscobayferry.com San Francisco Bay Ferry]''' provides service from several points on both sides of the Bay.  There are three terminals in Alameda:\n\n* Main Street on the northwest side of the main island - primarily has service during the middle of the day on weekdays, as well as all day on weekends.\n* Alameda Seaplane on the west side of the main island - used for morning and evening commuting.\n* Harbor Bay on Bay Farm Island - only used for rush hour commuting\n\n===By train===\n'''Amtrak''' does not service Alameda directly, but four of its train routes arrive at two nearby stations.\n\n* '''[http://capitolcorridor.org/ Capitol Corridor]''' San Jose to Auburn (California)|Auburn via Sacramento). The route also includes a stop at the Oakland Coliseum/Airport Amtrak station, adjacent to the Oakland Coliseum BART station. The Oakland Coliseum/Airport Amtrak station has no station agents.

Capitol Corridor conductors provide two free bus passes upon request. Getting to Alameda by bus requires one transfer. Pick up '''[http://www.actransit.org/maps/schedule_results.php?version_id=39&amp;quick_line=12&amp;Go=Go AC Transit Line 12]''' at its terminal on Alice, across the street from Amtrak. The bus may wait at this stop for several minutes before departing. Ride the 12 to the 7th and Broadway stop. From that stop, walk back along Broadway, cross 7th, and go with the flow of traffic to the bus stop at 7th and Franklin (less than one block). From this stop, four lines serve Alameda: '''[http://www.actransit.org/maps/schedule_results.php?version_id=39&amp;quick_line=19&amp;Go=Go Line 19]''', '''[http://www.actransit.org/maps/schedule_results.php?version_id=21&amp;quick_line=20&amp;Go=Go Line 20]''', '''[http://www.actransit.org/maps/schedule_results.php?version_id=21&amp;quick_line=51a&amp;Go=Go Line 51A]''', and\n'''[http://www.actransit.org/maps/schedule_results.php?version_id=39&amp;quick_line=96&amp;Go=Go Line 96]'''.\n\n* '''California Zephyr''' Emeryville to Chicago via Sacramento. Reachable by a bus ride via both AC Transit and the Emery-Go-Round.\n\nPassengers riding the California Zephyr train should arrive at the '''Emeryville Station (EMY)'''—the train's western terminal. Getting to Alameda by bus requires one transfer. From the train, walk through the station, veer left, and continue two blocks along 59th St. to Hollis St. At the bus stop just to the right of this intersection, pick up '''[http://www.actransit.org/maps/schedule_results.php?version_id=39&amp;quick_line=29&amp;Go=Go AC Transit Line 29]'''.

The 10-minute ferry runs from Jack London Square in Oakland, and it allows bikes to be taken on board.\n\n==Get around==\n\n=== By car ===\nAlameda is an island, and as such it's difficult to get truly lost if you have your basic bearings. The island is bordered on the north by the Oakland estuary and to the south by the San Francisco bay. The west end of the island is taken up by Alameda Point, the site of the former Naval Air Station. At the south end, you'll find a bridge to Bay Farm Island.\n\n=== By bus ===\nSeveral AC Transit bus lines go around the island.  There is a late-night bus service from Fruitvale BART to Broadway, down Santa Clara and up Webster to Downtown Oakland.  There are also a couple of rush hour shuttles from Webster St. commercial area to Jack London Square/Lake Merritt BART area.\n\n=== By foot ===\nWalking is a great way to get around.  Walking from Oakland is not recommended.\n\n=== By ferry ===\nTraveling from the Harbor Bay ferry terminal area to the Main Street terminal area is faster by ferry than by bus.  This only works during rush hour.\n\n==See==\n* \n* \n* \n\n==Do==\n\n* \n*\n*\n\n==Buy==\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n== Eat ==\n\n=== Budget ===\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Mid-range===\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n=== Splurge ===\n\n==Drink==\n\n===Pubs===\n* \n* \n* \n\n===Breweries===\n\n* \n* \n\n===Bars &amp; nightclubs===\n* \n* \n* \n\n===Coffee, tea &amp; chocolate===\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Sleep==\n* \n* \n*\n* \n* \n* \n\n==Connect==\n\n* The '''''[https://alamedapost.com/ Alameda Post]''''' is Alameda's only remaining local news site of note; the others went out of business or folded into the ''East Bay Times''.\n\n==Go next==\nSan Leandro is across the bay by using California State Route 61, there are plenty of shorelines and beaches here, as well as malls, hotels and worldwide industries (including Otis Spunkmeyer's and Ghirardelli's worldwide headquarters)\n\n\n\n\n"

Alamos is the main historical attraction of Sonora, and one of Mexico's most splendid colonial cities. As the most northern of the colonial pueblos, Alamos has a rich history of conquistadors, mining barons, imperialists and revolutionaries. Upon entering the city, you'll experience a feeling of a different age, of Spanish romanticism, of Old Mexico.\n\n==Understand==\n\nHistorically an important center of silver mining, the town's economy is now dominated by the tourist sector. It has been designated a ''pueblo mágico'' due to its architecture. \n\nÁlamos today is known for its charming atmosphere and warm, friendly people, where one can leave the hurried life behind and relax into the serene lifestyle of this small colonial gem. The population hovers around 6,000 people in the city and another 4,000 inhabitants in outlying areas yet Álamos retains the grandeur of its colonial past.\n\nÁlamos is known as “La Ciudad de los Portales” (portales are tall, arched, covered verandas or walkways fronting many of the cobble-stoned streets or calles). Álamos boasts numerous buildings exhibiting classic Andalusian architecture from Mexico's Colonial period, including numerous mansions, the Plaza de Armas, the Church of La Purísima Concepción, La Capilla and the Palacio Municipal (“city hall”).\n\nThe great wealth created by the silver mines from the surrounding mining towns of La Aduana, Minas Nuevas, and others enabled the founders and residents of Álamos to build scores of colonial Spanish mansions throughout the town; most of them went into ruin in the early 20th century but in the late 1940s, a number of Americans and Canadians began buying and restoring the houses.\n\n===Climate ===\nThe climate, due to its position in the Sierras, retains cool, pleasant days in the winter, some hot days in the summer and spectacular rain storms in July &amp; August. The area offers almost 360 days of sunshine. Álamos has three seasons: a hot, dry season from April to June, a hot, humid wet season from July to October, and a warm, generally dry “winter” from November to March. \n\n==Get in==\n\n\n===By bus===\nFrom Hermosillo, [https://acnautobuses.com/ ACN Autobuses] has routes along the coast and can take you to '''Navajoa''' (a 3½-hour trip that costs M$350), where you can change to an [https://www.albatrosautobuses.mx/ Albatros] bus for the 1-hour trip to Alamos.

It's a modern town but dominated by its ancient citadel, with a long beach strip either side. \n\n== Understand ==\nMuch of Turkey's coastline is rugged, with only small coves for harbours and inland access, but from Antalya to Alanya and further east is the low coastal plain of Pamphylia. It's narrow, hemmed in by the Taurus Mountains, but has attracted settlers from prehistoric times to the modern era of Airbuses and Boeings. \"Pamphylia\" means land of many peoples, and each of them has occupied the defensible crag here and given it a different name. The Luwians called it Korakassa or \"protruding city\" for the way the crag divides the long sweep of beach, and then it was Coracesium then Kalonoros. When the Seljuks captured it in the 13th century under Sultan Alaeddin Kayqubad I, some savvy courtier renamed it Alaiye after him, so it only remained for Atatürk to enjoy an overnight stay in 1935 and tweak the name to Alanya. Modern tour operators call it \"Antalya Region Alanya\" from the airport you fly into: this entity stretches for over 20 km either side of town.\n\n== Get in ==\n\nAntalya Airport () 125 km west is the usual arrival point for international visitors. Those on package holidays are bussed straight to their hotels. Otherwise take tram 1A (every 15min) from Terminal 1 to the tram stop Cırnık, cross the bridge and take a bus (every 30min) from the bus stop called \"Serik Cd-1\" to Alanya. \n\nGazipaşa–Alanya Airport () is 30 km southeast of town and has flights from Istanbul (IST and SAW) and Ankara, plus a few budget carriers. The [https://havas.net/en/bus-services Havaş] shuttle from the airport to Alanya is available for every arriving flight. The fare is 165 TL (Feb 2024). For the way back there are about 5 departures per day. \n\nBuses from Istanbul run every hour or so and take 13 hours to Alanya; they may run via Afyon or via Bolu and Konya. In 2023 an adult single is about 800 TL. From Ankara they take 9 hours via Konya, from Izmir 8 hours via Denizli (for Pamukkale), and from Adana 9 hours via Mersin and Antalya. From Nevşehir (for Cappadocia) they take 9 hours via Konya, where you may have to change. Operators on these routes include [https://www.metroturizm.com.tr/ Metro Turizm], [https://www.pamukkale.com.tr/ Pamukkale] and Flixbus. \n\nAnother route from Istanbul or Ankara is to take the YHT fast train to Konya, which connects with buses to Antalya and Alanya, taking 6 hours.\n\nBuses from Antalya run every 30 min and take two hours, for a fare of 150 TL (Feb 2024). Operators include [https://alanyalilar.com.tr/ Alanyalilar] and [https://www.guneyakdeniz.com/ Güney Akdeniz], the long-distance bus lines don't offer tickets for this short hop.

Travel instead via Taşucu on the summer fast-cat or year-round car ferry.\n\nWith your own boat, Alanya is not a Port of Entry into Turkey, so if you arrive from Cyprus or other foreign waters, you need to clear immigration and customs at Taşucu to the east or Antalya to the west.\n\n== Get around ==\n'''Walking''' is best option in town centre.

Most of the area is free to stroll, and you only pay for ''İç Kale'' the inner castle.

Houses, shops and other buildings have sprung up within the citadel walls. Kale Cd the road up from town is a 3 km zigzag, and the taxis waiting near the foot are betting you can't walk it - see above for the cable-car.

                "revision": {
                    "text": "\n\n\nThe city of  '''Alappuzha''',  also known as '''Alleppey''', is situated in Kerala. Alappuzha is the smallest district in Kerala with a long coastline and many lagoons and backwaters. It is often called the ''Venice of the East'' due to the canals that connect it to Kerala's famous snaking Kerala backwaters|backwaters. The district headquarters is  70&amp;nbsp;km south of Cochin|Cochin&lt;nowiki/&gt;.\n\n==Understand==\nAlappuzha has a wonderful past that owes its modern existence to the efforts of Diwan Raja Kesavadas in the second half of the 18th century. Diwan Raja Kasavadas was instrumental in making Alappuzha a major port city in his time and for developing the system of inland canals, used for transportation and navigation, that is seen today.\n\nThe name Alappuzha means \"the land between the sea and network of rivers flowing into it\". It is a fitting name: there are a significant number of canals, backwaters, beaches and lagoons in and around the city.\n\nAlappuzha, and Kerala in general, has excellent weather due to its proximity to the ocean. The temperature rarely goes above 35 °C and never below 20 °C. The best time to visit is from September to March. The monsoon, from June to August, always brings heavy wind and rains. This is an excellent time to visit if you want to partake in a bit of monsoon tourism.\n\n==Get in==\n===By plane===\nCochin International Airport (). This is the nearest airport. Expect to pay about ₹450 for a taxi to get from Cochin airport to Cochin, and then more for a bus or train to Alappuzha. Another option is to take a local bus from nearby Athani, reachable by rickshaw. Alternatively, there are airports in Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum), Kozhikode (Calicut), Chennai, and Bangalore and you can catch a train to Alappuzha.\n\n===By train===\nTrain service is available to Alappuzha from different parts of Kerala such as Kochi (Cochin), Thiruvananthapuram, and Kozhikode, and from other major cities in India such as Chennai, Bengaluru (Bangalore), Coimbatore, Mumbai (Bombay), New Delhi, Mangalore, and Kolkata. If you are coming from Hyderabad, you can take the ''Sabari Express''.\n\n* \n\n===By bus===\nThere are bus services operating from Cochin (1 hr 45 min, ₹75 for KSRTC), Thiruvananthapuram (3½ hours, ₹150 for KSRTC), Kozhikode, Chennai, Bangalore (overnight luxury ₹800), Mysore, Coimbatore (overnight ₹250) to Alappuzha.\n\n===By car===\nThe entire Alappuzha district is well-connected by NH 66 (formerly NH 47).  It goes via the Alappuzha, Ambalapuzha and Cherthala towns. Alappuzha is well connected to other cities Kochi, Kottayam, Kollam, Thiruvananthapuram, Kozhikode, Chennai, Bangalore, Coimbatore by road.\n\nTourist taxis are the most convenient way to travel from attraction to attraction, especially while travelling as a group. They can be found at most airports and railway stations.\n\n==Get around==\n\n===By bus===\nLike elsewhere in Kerala, Alappuzha has a cheap and efficient local bus system. You can catch buses to almost eerywhere from the KSRTC bus stand, Alappuzha. \n\n=== By autorickshaw===\nThis is a cheap means of transportation between attractions. Make sure you agree on a price first. You can bargain or contact the tourist centre nearby to confirm the auto charges in the area before you set out.\n\n===By taxi===\nLocal taxis are also available for what many western wallets would consider cheap. There are car rental companies that offer cars with drivers or self-drive options. Rates often start at around ₹7 per km and increase depending on the extra features you select (i.e. whether you want a driver or a car with air-conditioning). If you are unfamiliar with the area, or with driving on Indian roads, you should get a driver as well, who will also be able to recommend places to eat and visit.\n\n=== By boat===\nA visit to Alappuzha would not be complete without making a journey by boat. In some cases, such as visiting Kuttanad, boats are the preferred method of transport as some locations are inaccessible by road.\n\nThere are ferry services between places, widely used by the locals, which are a scenic way of getting around. \n\nThe government-run Kerala State Water Transport Corporation (KSWTC) boats are there at the boat jetty opposite to Alappuzha KSRTC bus stand. One can use the service and alight at any preferred location at cheap rates by making use of the service. Tourist boat service to the Kollam district is also available from Alappuzha boat jetty at reasonable price.\n\nBoat service is available to Kottayam at every two hours interval starting from 7:30AM. The fare is ₹18 and the trip takes two hours.\n* \n\n=== By foot===\nMany of Alappuzha's attractions are easily accessible by foot.\n\n==See==\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* The city itself is a sight to see. Exploring the city, especially by boat, can often lead to memorable experiences. Bring a camera, there are many photo opportunities on the waterways and beaches.\n* If you are visiting Alappuzha, enquire about the schedule of '''temple festivals'''. Alappuzha is one of the few places in Kerala where non-Hindus are allowed enter temple premises. Alappuzha temples are generally more open and accepting, though there might be a few areas inside the temples where entry is restricted. The '''Ambalapuzha temple festival''' is particularly impressive. Five elephants carry the Krishna idol, with a music accompaniment, for a distance of about 14 km away from Alappuzha and to the temple. Make sure you try the rose ''palpayasam'' a traditional, sweet, milk delicacy made by boiling milk until it condenses and turns into a light pink colour.\n* \n* \n* \n*\n* \n* \n\n==Do==\n\n* \n* \n* \n* '''Activities''' Overnight canoe trips, bamboo furniture making classes, music lessons, yoga, painting classes etc. are organised daily at the Bamboostix Island Resort. Ayurvedic Massage &amp; courses at Sreekrishna and Keraleeyam. Anil at Seashore restaurant organises boating on small foam boat used by Kerala fishermen and even fishing expeditions\n* Main industry in Alleppey is '''coir manufacturing'''. Coir is made of coconut husk. Some of bigger producers organize '''tours''' of their facilities\n* A bicycle can be rented to tour the town and surrounding areas although travelers are advised to be alert and cautious of unpredictable traffic.\n* \n\n===Houseboat touring===\nAlappuzha is inlaid with channels that support thriving backwater tourism. A '''houseboat cruise''' along the backwaters can be a great way to see and do all that is available in Alappuzha. Houseboats can be rented for 12 hr to few days. There is a new hop-on, hop-off service through remote backwaters in a shared-houseboat. These boats come equipped with a furnished bedroom, sit-outs, kitchen, modern bath and toilet facilities. Some of the house boats even sport an air-conditioner. The houseboats are manned by drivers and a cook. From the boat, you can observe the everyday village life of people, stop for a toddy (''traditional mildly alcoholic drink made from coconut sap'') with grilled prawns, watch birds, and relax in the middle of the lake.\n\nIt's advisable to book a houseboat through houseboat operators rather than depending on touts. Touts take commissions between ₹500 to ₹2000. Book on the internet if the option is available; it is far better to not wait until the last minute during the high season. Booking on the internet can sometimes earn you a lower price and most, reputable operators have good online service and support. Average pricing is variable, depending on season and demand, but you can expect a base price in the range of ₹8,000 overnight (21&amp;nbsp;hours) for standard non-a/c, ₹10,000 for standard a/c and ₹12,000 for Premium. If you are lucky, you can sometimes get last minute bargains from houseboat operators whose boat does not have business on that particular day and can get a 2 a/c bedroom houseboat for one night even for ₹6,500-7,000.\n\nSome contacts for houseboat booking are:\n\n:* '''[http://www.BeebeEvents.com Beebe Events]:''' Provides houseboat services, transportation with professional guides, custom tour packages. mail to:Info@BeebeEvents.com, Tel.: +91 94000 73030, +91 47722 43030.\n\n:* \n\n:* '''[http://indigenoustour.com/house-boats Indigenous Houseboats]''' Houseboat cruise operator which have won the “Best Exhibit Award” at the International Boat Show. &lt;!-- what year?

Its two-storey building is typical of Kerala architecture. It contains impressive murals worth watching. The palace also housed a museum of antique sculptures and artefacts.\n* '''Padanilam  Temple''' - a famous Parabrahma temple located 14&amp;nbsp;km from Mavelikkara.\n* '''Sree Nagaraja Temple''' in '''Mannarasala''' is 32&amp;nbsp;km south of Alappuzha near Harippad. It is a Brahman family owned snake temple featuring beautiful stone carvings of snakes throughout its territory. It is headed by a priestess. The temple deity is credited with restoring fertility in women. The turmeric paste available there supposedly cures many diseases. This is believed to be capital of Snake God- the Vasuki (Naga Raja) and his consorts- Naga Yakshi (Snake Ghostess) as well as Naga Rani (Snake Queen) along with a huge battalion of Snake army. Naga aradhana(worship of snakes) is very unique to Kerala's culture, as its believed Kerala is derived out of Naga Empire and most of the people do worship snakes as a Thanksgiving for lending their land for humans to live. Snakes are believed to keep the vision of eyes as well as preserving fertility of humans. Hence they are worshiped for bestowing children as well as curing blindness. Manarsala temple is a wonderful place, built within a natural forest with trees and creepers covering the area, where snakes live. The only temple, where its a lady priest who worships and do rituals. A special ceremony, by which an Uruli (a brass open vessel used for cooking) is turn up-side down before the sanatorium, to seek bestowing children by childless couples. Its believed that they get conceived within 21 days of time.\n* '''Sree Subrahmonia Swamy temple''' :   Sree Subrahmonia Swamy temple, at Haripad, is one of the oldest and most important temples devoted to Lord Subrahmonia. It is situated at the 53rd Kilometre on the Kollam-Alapuzha highway. The image of the deity with four arms is also the biggest of the kind. It is believed to have been originally worshipped by Parashurama. In 1921, a fire destroyed the temple. It was rebuilt with the anakottil  (elephant's head), kuttambalam, a big tank etc. Several annual festivals are celebrated in this temple the Avani Utsavam in Chingom (August- September), Markazhi Utsavam in Dhanu (November- December), Chitra Utsavam in Medom (April–May), Kartika in Vrischikam (November- December) and Taipuyam (January- February). Kavadiyattam dance with Kavadi is the most important offering here. Kavadi is a bow-shaped wooden structure decorated with tapestry and peacock feathers carried on the shoulders of pilgrims as an offering to God Subrahmanya. The peacock in the temple and the procession with the golden peacock throne are very attractive. \n\n\n\n"

Lake Clark's spectacular scenery provides a true wilderness experience for those who visit.\n* – Chugach, Wrangell, and Saint Elias mountain ranges converge here in what is often referred to as the \"mountain kingdom of North America.\" It has the continent's largest assemblage of glaciers and greatest collection of peaks above .\n* – along the Canadian border in central Alaska\n\n==Understand==\n\nImage:Alaska Federal &amp; National Lands.PNG|thumb|450px|Federal and Native lands in Alaska\n\nIn 1867 (two years after the end of the Civil War), the territory of Alaska was purchased from the Russian Empire for $7.2 million (or about 2 cents an acre). For many years people referred to the acquisition as \"Seward's Folly\", named for Secretary of State William H. Seward (1801–1872) who made the deal. They viewed Alaska as a  frozen wasteland, not realizing it would turn out to be one of the United States' richest resources for gold and oil.\n\nIt took until 1959 for the territory to become a state of the Union. Most of the land is still wilderness; nicknamed ''The Last Frontier'', Alaska keeps the spirit of the Old West|Wild West alive.\n\nMost maps of the US represent the size of Alaska inaccurately, inserting it at a smaller scale in some corner. On the other hand, Mercator maps make northern regions such as Alaska look larger – it isn't the size of Brazil, just a fifth of it, which still is ''huge'', more than twice the size of the second biggest US state, Texas.\n\nMost of northern Alaska is incredibly sparsely populated. Many places are only reachable by air or water and roads take a toll from the harsh climate, so carefully plan your itinerary before heading out. That being said, a truly breathtaking environment will more than make up for the hardships of getting there and around. With the size, climate also varies with moderate rainy climates in the south and ice desert in places like Utqiaġvik (Barrow); see also Winter in North America.\n\nThe fact that it was only colonized relatively lately (Russian presence never amounted to more than a few thousand fur trappers along the coast) makes for a relatively strong presence of native populations who – along with state and federal government entities – still own large parts of the land (see the map above).\n\nAlaska observes all the United States of America#Holidays|federal holidays, except Columbus Day, and adds Seward’s Day (last Monday in March) and Alaska Day (October 18th). However, some cities and towns that have a large population of federal workers or military personnel may observe Columbus Day, anyway.\n\nAlaska's oil wealth has allowed it to be the only state to provide its citizens with a universal basic income of around $1,600 a year.\n\n===Tourist information ===\n* [https://www.travelalaska.com/ Travel Alaska] website\n\n==Talk==\nAlaska, of course, speaks English, with about 84% of the population saying English is their primary language, but also many native languages are spoken, including Inupiat, Central Siberian Yupik, Central Alaskan Yup'ik, Alutiiq, Aleut, Dena'ina, Deg Xinag, Holikachuk, Koyukon, Upper Kuskokwim, Gwich'in, Lower Tanana, Upper Tanana, Tanacross, Hän, Ahtna, Eyak, Tlingit, Haida, and Coast Tsimshian. Some Russian Phrasebook|Russian is also spoken. In the Nikolaevsk village in Kenai Peninsula, founded by Russian Old Believers in the 1960s, Russian is spoken more than English.\n\nThere is a dialect spoken in the Last Frontier, but there isn't enough data on the English of Alaska to either include it within Western American English or assign it its own \"separate status\". Not far from Anchorage, in Alaska's Matanuska-Susitna Valley, is a distinctly Minnesota-like accent due to immigration of Minnesotans to the valley in the 1930s. However for newcomers, there are some words that are unique, magical, special, exclusive, found out, or originated in Alaska. So there are words to sound like a local, which are:\n* '''Cheechako''' – A newcomer to Alaska.\n* '''Sourdough''' – A long-time Alaskan.\n* '''Snowbird''' – A snowbird is an individual who spends summers in Alaska and migrates south for winter.\n* '''Termination Dust''' – First snowfall in the mountains each year.\n* '''Ditch Diver''' – Individual that owns a 4-wheel-drive vehicle and learns the hard way by driving too fast on ice and snow.\n* '''Outside''' – Referring to the rest of the US and outside beyond Alaskan borders, when talking about going outside.\n* '''Lower 48''' - The Contiguous United States\n* '''Snow Machine''' – Snowmobile\n* '''Sno-go''' - Snow Machine\n* '''U-Park''' – University Park; the areas surrounding Alaska’s college campuses.\n\n==Get in==\n===By plane===\n\n\nAnchorage#By plane|Anchorage, and to a lesser extent Fairbanks#By plane|Fairbanks, are served by [http://www.alaskaair.com Alaska Airlines] and [http://www.delta.com Delta Air Lines] year round from the lower 48, particularly from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport|Seattle but also from other cities in the lower 48 (such as from Denver on [http://www.united.com United]). Juneau, Ketchikan, Petersburg (Alaska)|Petersburg, Sitka, Wrangell and are also served by daily jet service through Alaska Airlines flights originating in Seattle and terminating in Anchorage, on a point to point routing system. Other airlines such as Air Canada, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Sun Country and other international carriers offer service to Anchorage on a seasonal basis rather than all-year round. Other communities within the state are served by an extensive system of regional and local air services from Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau, and Ketchikan, the state's four largest urban areas (See \"By Air\" under \"Getting Around\" in below). Because of vast distances and the limited number of roads, air travel is the cheapest and most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state. Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport accommodates the upsurge in tourism and serves over 5 million passengers annually (2018). Anchorage International is a very big and clean airport that isn't very crowded. It has many different amenities for awaiting passengers to enjoy. They have everything from shops, restaurants, duty-free shops, and bars by where you board your plane. Be sure to check out the various animal displays for an early look at some of the state's more difficult to find inhabitants. A record-size halibut can be found on display just below the stairs that lead from the main concourses to baggage claim. Below that, you'll find several other animal specimens worth a glance on your way to your rental car or other transportation.  The biggest problem with flying into Anchorage is that if you're not staying in Anchorage, you are going to need to take a long drive to wherever your destination is; most people just rent a car, which can be costly. If you are visiting family, you are better off just having them come and pick you up by the Security Screening area or meet you at the Baggage Claim area.  No one likes to embark on a long drive after a long flight, but the scenery you will see will make you forget all about the long-distance journey.\n\nFairbanks International Airport, a state-owned public-use airport  southwest of downtown, offers basic services for travelers.\n\n===By car===\n\n\nAlaska is connected to the contiguous U.S. (known in Alaska as the \"Lower 48\" or \"outside\") through Canada via the Alaska Highway. The highway is paved and maintained year-round. Sometimes it can seem a little over-maintained, creating a uniquely Alaskan and Canadian situation: at any given time in the summer, you're bound to hit at least several dozen (and sometimes hundreds of!) miles of road construction. Since the roads in construction zones usually have only one working lane and, due to the scarcity of roads in the rural areas, there are not always alternate routes available, the construction companies operate \"pilot cars\" (usually pick-up trucks with yellow rotating beacons and large signs that say \"Follow me\"). They drive back and forth between the two ends of the construction zone and lead the vehicles safely to the other end. Depending on the length of the construction zone, the wait can be anywhere from 10 minutes to several hours. Since there's only one main road, you can't really drive around the construction. The roads that aren't being worked on are usually in great condition. Considering the winter conditions, the roads are in great condition. Every year Alaska gets hit with tons of snow, and the roads take a pounding because of all the weight and plowing that must occur. It is easy to complain about all the construction, but without it people would complain more about the road conditions. Most of Alaska's highways are smooth and freshly paved. All-terrain vehicles (ATVs) are very common for natives to use when traveling short distances. Be careful of them while you're driving because they come out from all areas: both on-road and off-road.\n\nIf you're planning to drive to or around Alaska, make sure to pick up a copy of ''[https://themilepost.com/ The Milepost]'', which is widely regarded as the premier road guide for western Canada and Alaska. Most roads in these regions have small white posts every mile or so indicating the number of miles from the start of the road. The Milepost has extremely detailed route descriptions of all of the roads, pointing out everything from scenic viewpoints and campgrounds down to the names of small creeks the roads pass over. If you're flying in to Anchorage and then driving around the state, pick up a copy of ''The Milepost'' at one of the local Costcos or Walmarts – the price there is around half of list price.\n\nDriving distances in Alaska may be far greater than you are used to.  Although the speed limit on most of the paved highways in state is set at  (there are lower limits near towns and in highway safety corridors, most notably on the Parks and Seward Highways), these are not freeways, and safe passing zones are limited on many stretches of road.  You are likely to encounter large numbers of semi trucks, particularly on the Parks, Elliott, and Dalton Highways, as well as private vehicles hauling large tow-behind trailers.  Take extra care when attempting to pass these vehicles, as they may be longer than they appear to be from behind.\n\nThere may be restrictions on which highways rental vehicles may be taken on.  The Dalton, Denali, Steese and Cassiar Highways, and the Nabesna and McCarthy Roads, in particular, are considered no-gos by many vehicle rental companies; if your rental vehicle is damaged on one of these routes, insurance purchased through the rental company may not cover repair or retrieval expenses.  Always check for restrictions before making plans to travel any of the state's unpaved highways.\n\nIf you will be traveling on one of the state's unpaved roads, go prepared.  Distances between services are frequently large, weather can change rapidly and without warning, and many reaches of the state outside of the population centers lack cell service.  Travelers on the Dalton Highway|Dalton, upper reaches of the Elliott, Steese, and Denali Highways are especially well advised to carry extra fuel, at least one spare tire, and basic survival gear.\n\nSome rental car companies may offer one-way rentals in and out of the state in the shoulders of the tourist season (one-way into the state before summer and one-way out of the state after summer). Check with each agency for details.\n\nIf an immigration issue prevents you from entering Canada, you cannot enter Alaska by car from the contiguous states. Canadian customs regulations state that Canadian residents may not rent a vehicle in the United States (including Alaska) and drive it into Canada.\n\n===By boat===\n\nThe Alaska Marine Highway System operates a ferry service from Bellingham (Washington)|Bellingham, Washington up the beautiful Inside Passage to Haines. Plan your travel early as this service tends to fill up fast. A connecting ferry can take you to Whittier (Alaska)|Whittier (although this service is much less frequent—suggest you call for details) from which the [https://www.alaskarailroad.com/ Alaska Railroad] connects to Anchorage. The Marine Highway also operates along the coast of South central Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, and Prince William Sound. Some private companies operate shuttle vans between Whittier and Anchorage as well, and the combination rail/highway tunnel allows road traffic in alternating directions every half hour. There is only one rental company in Whittier, [https://www.avis.com/ Avis], which operates seasonally and with a limited number of cars. If you're arriving by ship without a car and want to drive to Anchorage, make reservations well in advance for one-way rentals and be prepared to pay an extremely high rate and a substantial one-way drop fee. Unless you've got five people and tons of luggage, it's usually better to make alternate arrangements (train or bus) to Anchorage and rent a vehicle there.\n\nAs mentioned above, Avis also offers one-way rentals from Skagway to the rest of Alaska. The only road from Skagway to the rest of Alaska travels through Canada.\n\nVarious cruise lines sail up the Inside Passage as well, typically ending in Seward or Whittier (these cruise lines usually—but not always, so check—provide transportation to Anchorage and may even include package tours or your return air travel out of the state).  Cruises depart from cities such as Seattle, Vancouver, and even San Francisco.\n\nBoats are a necessity in a lot of areas of Alaska. There are still many natives who rely on the use of their boats to get them into town for things such as shopping. If you are going on a fishing or hunting trip, chances are you are going to have to take a boat to get to your destination. You can drive into town from the airport and park your car at a loading dock for either short-term or long-term parking. From there, you can either board your own private boat or take a commercial boat to where you need to go. Many of the hunting and fishing expeditions will have a boat ready for you at a certain time to get you where you need to be for your adventure. Alaskan natives will bring their boats to these docks and park them there while they do their shopping. When they're done, they will load up and take the trip back to their respective house or cabin. This process can sometimes be very difficult and strenuous, especially for older adults and younger children.\n\nThe Yukon River once played a huge role in accessing the interior of Alaska. Commercial steamboats once operated in the region, and goods are still transported by ship into remote interior areas. Some other rivers are also navigable. Though there is nothing that smacks of passenger service, it is theoretically possible though difficult to arrange a ride on a cargo ship, but you will have to do your own research.\n\n===By bus===\nGiven the distances involved and the fare required to travel those distances, the cost of taking a bus from Canada and the lower 48 to Alaska vs. flying is about the same.  See \"By bus\" under \"Getting around\" for a list of bus companies offering intrastate services within Alaska.\n\nFrom Whitehorse, [https://alaskashuttle.com/ Alaska Yukon Trails] provide service to Fairbanks via Dawson City. From Prince Rupert you can continue north to the southeastern panhandle of Alaska via Ketchikan by [https://dot.alaska.gov/amhs/comm/prince_rupert.shtml ferry] or you can also begin the ferry journey from [http://www.dot.state.ak.us/amhs/comm/bellingham.shtml Bellingham, Washington,] to the southeastern panhandle as well (see \"By boat\" in the above for more details).\n\nThe only option for travel to Alaska without a car from the lower 48 is by ferry (from Bellingham to the SE panhandle via Prince Rupert) or by plane.\n\n==Get around==\n\nMost cities and villages in the state outside of the south-central region or southern interior are accessible only by sea or air. The [http://www.akferry.org/ Alaska Marine Highway System] also serves the cities of Southeast and the Alaska Peninsula. Cities not served by road or sea can only be reached by air, accounting for Alaska's extremely well-developed bush air services—an Alaskan novelty.\n\n===By plane===\n]]\nAlthough Anchorage is accessible via most major domestic carriers and some international carriers, '''[https://www.alaskaair.com/ Alaska Airlines]''' has a virtual monopoly on jet air travel within the state, meaning prices are extremely high in comparison to comparable distances in the lower 48. The airline offers frequent jet service from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional hubs like Bethel, Nome, Kotzebue, Dillingham, Kodiak, and other larger communities as well as to major Southeast and Alaska Peninsula communities. Smaller communities are served by the main regional jet and turboprop commuter airlines:  '''[https://www.flygrant.com/ Grant Aviation]''' and '''[https://www.ravnalaska.com/ Ravn Alaska]'''. The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered Bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan, the Piper Navajo, or the smaller Cessna 207, the most popular aircraft in use in the state. But perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the seaplane. The world's busiest seaplane base is Lake Hood, next to Ted Stevens airport in Anchorage, where flights bound for remote areas carry passengers, cargo, and lots of items from Costco and Sam's Club.\n\nSmall planes are a great way to get around Alaska if you are able to afford it. After you have touched down from your main flight to Alaska, you can board small planes that can transport you fast and efficiently. Many places aren't accessible by car or truck; so small planes are commonly used to get to the destinations quickly. If you are going on a hunting trip, chances are that you will need to board one of these planes to get there. Hunting areas in Alaska are sometimes commercialized for tourists. The areas that they bring you to are commonly hunted by other tourists. This continued use has made it a lot easier for pilots to land. A pilot can land on flat ground that is continuously used for landing small planes onto.\n\nConocoPhillips and BP also have their own airline as  '''[http://www.northslopetravel.com/ ConocoPhillips/BP Joint Joint Service Aviation]''' which operates shuttle flights (on leased Boeing 737 planes) to the North_Slope_Borough|North Slope from Anchorage and Fairbanks for employees and contractors of BP, ConocoPhillips and other contracting companies established in the North Slope.\n\n===By train===\n\n* The '''[https://www.alaskarailroad.com/ Alaska Railroad]''' runs from Seward through Anchorage, Denali, and Fairbanks to North Pole (Alaska)|North Pole, with a spur to Whittier (Alaska)|Whittier. The railroad is famous for its summertime passenger services but also plays a vital part in moving Alaska's natural resources—primarily coal—to ports in Anchorage, Whittier and Seward as well as fuel and gravel for use in Anchorage. The Alaska Railroad is the only remaining railroad in North America to use cabooses on its freight trains. The route between Talkeetna and Hurricane (between Talkeetna and Denali) features one of the last remaining flag stop train services in North America. A stretch of the track along an area inaccessible by road serves as the only transportation to cabins in the area. Residents board the train in Talkeetna and tell the conductor where they want to get off. When they want to come to town, they wait by the side of the tracks and \"flag\" the train, giving it its name.\n\n* \n\n===By car===\n\nAlaska is the least-connected state in terms of road transportation. The state's road system covers a relatively small area of the state, linking the central population centers and the Alaska Highway, the principal route out of the state through Canada. The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system. One unique feature of the road system is the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel, which links the Seward Highway south of Anchorage with the relatively isolated community of Whittier. The tunnel is the longest road tunnel in North America at nearly 2.5 miles and combines a one-lane roadway and train tracks in the same housing. Consequently, eastbound traffic, westbound traffic, and the Alaska Railroad must share the tunnel, resulting in waits up to 45 minutes (or more) to enter; for specific times, see the [https://dot.alaska.gov/creg/whittiertunnel/index.shtml schedule].\n\nIn their daily discourse Alaskans never refer to roads or highways by numerical designations, instead preferring named designations such as “Seward Highway” or \"Glenn Highway”. If you use the route numbers, Alaskans will probably not know what you are referring to.\n\nAnchorage and Fairbanks are served by all of the major national rental car chains as well as a number of independents. Some smaller towns around the state may also have a national chain company presence.  Renting a car in Alaska can be more expensive than pretty much anywhere else in the United States, ranging up to (and occasionally even over) $200 per day for a large vehicle sufficient to carry multiple passengers and outdoor gear during the peak season. In the dead of winter, however, you can sometimes grab a vehicle for under $10 per day.\n\nRenting at the Anchorage or Fairbanks airport incurs a 10-12% additional airport surcharge (plus an additional $4.81 per day in Anchorage). If you're renting for more than a few days, it might be worth the hassle to rent your vehicle at an off-airport location, which usually involves taxi rides or shuffling between hotel and rental car courtesy shuttles. Check with each agency or search off-airport rental cars using an online travel agency to see what cost savings may be available.\n\nBe aware that in winter, roads are maintained for ''winter'' drive-ability. Outside of urban centers, they are generally not cleared \"down to the pavement\" and salt application is unheard of in much of the state, with sand being used instead to add traction. There is therefore still a layer of snow or ice on top of the road surface, which is actually optimal for a properly outfitted vehicle with appropriate tires, which your rental car probably is not.\n\n===By bus===\nFor those traveling independently without a car there are several companies that connect Anchorage to Kenai Peninsula to the south and to Denali National Park and/or Fairbanks to the north in the Interior and South Central parts of the state on a regularly scheduled basis, where it's most accessible by road. There are also limited service up to Prudhoe Bay on the Arctic coast from Fairbanks by the Dalton Highway Express and over to Whitehorse YT by Alaska Yukon Trails. Bus services outside of the Interior and South Central regions are limited due to a limited availability of roads. See the respective article for a particular locale as to what may be available there. Bus companies in Alaska come and go frequently with one going out of business and another taking its place while some merged into one company. The following have been consistent and stable over the last few years:\n* \n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \nSome of the above companies also offer chartered and sightseeing services in addition to their regularly scheduled services. Some may operate seasonally in the summer while others operate year round with different schedules for winter and summer. Check their website or call them.\n\nInformation on transit can be found [https://www.apta.com/research-technical-resources/public-transportation-links/alaska/ here].\n\n===By bike===\n\nWhile sidewalks and bike paths are present in the main cities, bicycling along the major highways is a dangerous proposition.  Areas near the main cities occasionally offer bike paths and wide shoulders, but many areas of Alaska's main highways are not advisable for bicycling.  The Seward and portions of the Glenn Highways, in particular, have very narrow shoulders and are flanked by cliffs on one or both sides, leaving very little or no room for pedestrians and bicyclists to travel safely.\n\n===By boat===\n\n\nOne of the best ways to see Alaska is by cruise ship. Cruise ships bring you wonderfully close to glaciers, whales and rocky coasts.  Larger boats offer more amenities, while small ships and yachts carrying 12-100 passengers go where the big ships can't, getting you up close to Alaska's nature and wildlife.  Many vessels include naturalist guided hikes and sea kayaking right from the ship, perfect for active, casual travelers.\n\nCruise ships have 2 main itineraries: the Inside Passage Route going roundtrip from either Seattle, Washington or Vancouver, Canada and the Gulf Route running Northbound and Southbound cruises between Vancouver and Seward/Whittier.\n\nCompanies offering cruises in Alaska include:\n\n*'''[https://www.hollandamerica.com/ Holland America]'''.  The Glacier Discovery Cruise offered by Holland America Line, runs between Seward and Vancouver, BC.\n*'''[https://www.princess.com/ Princess Cruises]''', offers both Inside Passage and Glacier Bay routes as well as roundtrips from San Francisco.\n*'''AdventureSmith Explorations ''' Expedition and small ship cruises statewide aboard ships and yachts carrying 12-132 guests. \n*'''[https://www.adventure-life.com/ Adventure Life]''', offers small-ship cruising exclusively, working with vessels in Alaska ranging from 32 to 138 passengers.\n*'''[https://www.ncl.com/ Norwegian Cruise Line]''', offers only roundtrips in Seattle and Vancouver.\n*'''[https://www.carnival.com/ Carnival Cruises]''', has only one ship deployed in Alaska annually doing mainly Northbound and Southbound cruises.\n*'''[https://www.rssc.com/ Regent Seven Seas Cruises]''', luxury cruise line with all inclusive cruises to Alaska.\n*'''[https://www.cruise118.com/ Cruise 118]''', Cruise 118 Holiday Cruises from Southampton to the Mediterranean, Alaska and the Caribbean.\n*'''[https://disneycruise.disney.go.com/ Disney Cruise Lines]''' Inside passage trip to Tracy Arm, Ketchikan, Skagway, and Juneau leaving from Vancouver~This is a great way to see the glaciers in Tracy Arm, as it is smaller than Princess or Carnival, so it can get closer, farther, and do a 360° turn\n\n'''Ferry'''\n*'''[https://dot.alaska.gov/ Alaska Marine Highway System]''', . Alaska's Marine Highway consists of over 8000 miles of coastal ocean routes connecting 31 port communities throughout Southeast, Southcentral and Southwest Alaska. Two additional ports are located outside of Alaska - one in British Columbia and the other in the state of Washington. It forms an essential method of transportation for many local residents in towns to which there is no road access. The Marine Highway system also allows walk-on travelers, bicycles and commercial vehicles. You can arrange your own cabin on the ferry, pitch a tent, or roll out a sleeping bag on the upper decks. Naturalists sometimes on board to give commentary on sights and wildlife.\n\nOf course, after you get off the boat, you'll want to stay and explore Alaska's inland destinations. Don't get straight on an airplane and head home—you'll miss out on some of the best Alaska has to offer!\n\nAlso try a fishing charter at any of Alaska's fine coastal communities and send your catch home to your family or friends.\n\n==See==\n over Bear Lake, Alaska]]\n\nImage:Denali-from-reflection-pond.jpg|thumb|300px|Denali (Mt. McKinley) in [[Denali National Park]]\n\nAlaska is huge.  It spans what once were five time zones!  It's so big in fact you probably won't scratch the surface of what it has to offer in terms of geography, wildlife, local flavor, or Alaska native culture.\n\nYou might visit a couple of the regions of the state during your visit.  It is quite possible to experience the ancient rainforest of Southeast Alaska, camp in Denali National Park, and kayak among icebergs in Prince William Sound  on the same trip.\n\nAnother option is to focus on a smaller (still huge) region of the state and spend enough time for a better look and then plan a return trip to explore a different region. Alaska does not have to be a once in a lifetime destination.\n\nThree weeks in the Inside Passage, traveling from town to town by ferry, is likely to leave you wanting more time if you enjoy hiking, sea kayaking, fishing, wildlife watching, scenery, Native culture, and biking.\n\nThe Kenai Peninsula, south of Anchorage, is another region worthy of an extended stay and is easily accessed from Anchorage. Plenty of public campgrounds make this an extremely affordable do-it-yourself destination if you have a few folks to share the cost of a rental car.\n\nAn Anchorage, Denali, Fairbanks, Valdez driving loop also offers plenty to see and do for two weeks or more and can be quite affordable with camping and a shared rental car.\n\n==Do==\n\nThere are many things to do when traveling to Alaska.  If you are the adventurous type then Alaska will be a great place to go.  You can go hiking, biking, Sea kayaking|kayaking, fishing, and expeditions to see the wildlife of Alaska like wolves, whales, moose, and bears. There are also month-long expeditions to the top of Denali.\n* A journey on the Dalton Highway provides a unique experience. The highway crosses mountains and tundra, the Arctic Circle, and 414 miles of pristine wilderness.\n*Stay up late to see the midnight sun, it's fascinating to watch in the summer when daytime seems endless.\n\nAnyone traveling to Alaska should definitely make a trip to Denali; it is absolutely beautiful and the highest point in North America. You can see it from hundreds of miles away when there are clear skies. However, if you get the opportunity to take a trip to see it up close, do it. An ATV ride up the side of a mountain can be one of the most eventful experiences of your trip. On the way up the path, you will see vegetation and wildlife that you can't see anywhere else. Once you finally get to the top of the mountain, you will see one of the most beautiful sites in all of the United States. Digital cameras and photos don't do the mountain's beauty enough justice. The mosaic of blues, whites, grays, and greens will leave you absolutely astonished.\n\nNot everyone is a fisherman; many people enjoy catching fish but hate waiting around to try and catch one. Well if you are one of those people, try fishing in Alaska. You will be amazed at how quickly you can catch fish there if you are in the right spot. You can definitely leave the river every day with your daily limit of fresh Alaskan salmon. There are plenty of charter fishing operators that will take you out to fish in some of the best areas.\n\n==Buy==\n\nIn Alaska cruise ports (especially Ketchikan, Juneau and Skagway) the tourist shopping experience is dominated by jewelry, tee shirts, and trinkets that could be purchased at any major cruise port in the world (perhaps from the same chain shop).  Yes, there are good buys occasionally (especially at the end of the season), but local products can be difficult to find.\n\nIf you are on a cruiseship, don't be afraid to visit stores not listed on the \"preferred business'\" list provided by the cruiseline.  Those businesses paid a premium to be listed and don't necessarily represent higher quality or better selection.\n\nLocal Alaskan artists are found in co-op and locally owned galleries. There are many books, from fiction to photos to nonfiction to children's, by Alaska writers, photographers and illustrators.\n\nBe sure to look for the distinctive 'Made in Alaska' sticker on products in gift shops and stores.  When purchasing Native-made handicrafts, keep the laws of your home country in mind; foreign travelers may find that they cannot bring their purchase home due to regulations regarding one or more of the materials used, which frequently range from whale baleen and bone to various furs, skins, teeth and other wild animal products, and may in some cases include artifact materials such as fossilized bone or tusk.\n\n==Eat==\nAlaskans love their food, fresh or otherwise you need good feed to keep up with daily life here. The portions in this state are huge. Almost every little town will have a local diner where one can get a filling breakfast and lots of hot coffee. Try the reindeer sausage with your eggs and hash in the morning and you'll feel like a true Alaskan.\n\nSome foods indigenous to this area are fireweed honey (distinctive and quite uniquely delicious), and spruce tip syrup made from the Sitka spruce which grows very commonly throughout Alaska; and of course there is perhaps the most well known of all Alaskan produce: seafood. Alaska's fishing grounds are among some of the richest in the world and feature among other delicacies King and Snow crab which are exported the world over. Many local restaurants close to the shore serve fresh halibut and salmon daily, right off the boats.  Fried halibut less than 24 hours out of the water is an experience like no other. The fish doesn't even need to be chewed it is so tender. Fresh salmon is usually best grilled or roasted . Crab is almost always pre-boiled at sea to preserve its freshness. Most coastal towns also have at least one place serving sushi made with local fish. Restaurant prices, like most other things in Alaska do tend to be rather high but the experience of eating truly fresh seafood is worth it.\n\nMost things in Alaska are going to feel like they are overpriced, but they are expensive because it is so expensive to transport goods and food to Alaska. If you are out to eat, don't rob yourself by ordering pasta or spaghetti, get some type of seafood or meat. Do not expect to find moose, bear, or other truly wild game on the menu at restaurants, as it is illegal to sell game meat.  Reindeer can commonly be found, and elk or yak will show up on occasion; in these cases, the animals have been raised domestically.  A lot of restaurants in Alaska serve \"catch of the day\" and other seafoods, especially along the coast. Chefs will almost always have a new spin on your favorite seafood that you'll never have the opportunity of trying again. Alaska is famous for their Alaskan King Crab legs. Many people think that they've had them before, but oftentimes they are sold as Alaskan king crab legs in the lower 48 states and they aren't actually Alaskan king crabs, and if they are, they aren't even close to as fresh as they are in Alaska. Many restaurants will cook them in lemon juice, butter, and Old Bay seasoning. You will know when you've had an Alaskan king crab leg because the legs are about the same thickness as a woman's wrist.\n\n==Drink==\n\nBeer is a big deal in Alaska with seven breweries in Anchorage alone. [http://www.alaskanbeer.com/ Alaskan Brewing Company] in Juneau is the best known brewery in the state and its Alaskan Amber leads beer sales. Other towns with local breweries include Homer, Haines, Kodiak, Fox (near Fairbanks), and Wasilla. In January there is the Great Alaska Beer and Barleywine event. It is the third largest in the United States and may be the largest event highlighting barleywine in the US.\n\nHomer, in addition to its brewery, contains a winery and products from both are available at local bars, restaurants, and liquor stores. Homer Brewery is fiercely (some might say stubbornly) local and their fresh ales are only available in the Homer area. The Bear Creek Winery creates wonderful vintages using imported grapes (as they cannot be grown easily in Alaska) and a variety of Alaskan berries.  Varietals range from Chardonnay to Port, and flavors abound. The Winery offers free tastings daily, and also has a very small number of luxury rooms to rent for those who really want to soak in the experience. Homer has a thriving night life, especially in the summer, so if you want to mix and mingle with \"real\" Alaskans this is a good place to do it.\n\nAlaska's liquor laws are in general no more or less restrictive than other states. However, two things may surprise you when you go looking for a drink. Firstly, alcohol may not be sold in the same store as groceries or general merchandise, but many large groceries get around this by having a liquor store attached to the main store.  Second, and unique to Alaska, an intoxicated person may not remain on the premises of an establishment with a liquor license, regardless of where they got drunk—so as a practical matter you must leave a bar once you have had enough to drink. It is a practical matter because it ''is'' enforced, especially when patrons get too rowdy.\n\n==Respect==\n\nWhen you are hiking or visiting a natural area, do not pick flowers or collect natural features, particularly in a national park or forest. These are protected areas, and if everyone took something away, it would spoil it for everyone else. Picking flowers takes away nectar that is vital for insects.\n\n'''Don't litter''': Alaska is a beautiful state, and the best way of keeping it that way is just by respect to the land. It is easy to throw your trash and cigarette butts away properly, and by doing so, you are saving countless plants and animals. Please don't be lazy, and throw your stuff in the garbage!\n\nSome folks think it is appropriate when camping to use the fire ring as a sort of waste incinerator, and just throw cigarette butts, garbage, and even cans and bottles into it. This is not proper waste disposal and is extremely discourteous, not to mention the toxic fumes from burning such things. If you pack it in, pack it out and dispose of it properly.\n\nThis may seem a  bit odd, but it is also courteous to clean your shoes ''before'' hiking in Alaska. Alaska has been plagued by numerous invasive plant species and you may have seeds on the soles of your shoes. Even within the state there are so many different environments that this is a real concern, and many trail heads have a shoe-brushing station for this reason. The same applies to boats, it's best to thoroughly clean the hull before putting it in Alaska's waters. Car washes are most effective for this.\n\nAlaska is a land of great beauty and wonder, but it is also a fragile ecosystem and a home to many diverse cultures. When visiting Alaska, it is important to be respectful of the land, the people, and the wildlife.\n\nHere are some specific and additional tips:\n* '''Learn about Alaska Native culture and history.''' Alaska is home to 11 distinct Alaska Native cultures, each with its own unique language, traditions, and worldview. Taking the time to learn about these cultures is a great way to show respect for the people who have lived on this land for centuries. There are many ways to learn about Alaska Native culture, including visiting museums, attending cultural events, and reading books and articles.\n* '''Be mindful of your impact on the environment.''' Alaska is home to some of the most pristine wilderness in the world, but it is also facing a number of environmental challenges, including climate change, pollution, and overfishing. When visiting Alaska, it is important to be mindful of your impact on the environment. This means packing out all trash, leaving no trace of your visit, and being respectful of wildlife.\n* '''Support local businesses and communities.''' When you visit Alaska, make an effort to support local businesses and communities. This helps to ensure that the benefits of tourism are shared widely and that local cultures are preserved. There are many ways to support local businesses, including eating at locally owned restaurants, shopping at local stores, and booking tours with local companies.\n* '''Don't disturb wildlife.''' Alaska is home to a variety of wildlife, including bears, moose, and wolves. It is important to keep your distance from wildlife and to never feed them. If you see wildlife, do not approach them and make sure to give them plenty of space.\n* '''Be aware of the weather and conditions.''' Alaska's weather can be unpredictable, so it is important to be prepared for anything. This means dressing appropriately, packing the right gear, and being aware of current weather conditions.\n* '''Be prepared for emergencies.''' Alaska is a remote state, so it is important to be prepared for emergencies. This means having a plan in place in case of things like getting lost, injured, or stranded. It is also important to have a first-aid kit and other necessary supplies.\n\n===Natives===\nAlaska Natives ''do not'' like being referred to as \"Indians\", \"Eskimos\", or \"Inuit\" (even the one Native group that is actually Inuit, the Iñupiat, rejects the term \"Inuit\"). They are not a monolithic culture; there are numerous tribes, now organized into \"Native corporations.\" Like most indigenous peoples in the Americas, they were cruelly victimized and wantonly killed by outsiders in the past, and were subject to coordinated attempts to destroy their unique cultures such as forced family separations and punishing children for speaking their own language in school. You may find yourself staying in ''their'' hotels and lodges and riding on ''their'' tour boats, and wherever you go used to be their land at some point, so it's not a great idea to stereotype or mock them. It is important to be respectful of cultural sensitivities, when visiting Alaska Native villages or communities. This includes asking permission before taking photos or videos, and dressing respectfully. It is also important to be aware of specific cultural protocols, such as how to greet people and how to address elders.\n\n==Stay safe==\n National Wildlife Refuge; a Kodiak bear injures a person on average once every two years]]\n\nAlaska enjoys a comparatively low crime rate and is generally a safe place to travel. Anchorage is a real \"big city\" and street crime is not uncommon. Some areas of Fairbanks have disturbingly high rates of drug and alcohol-related violence, prostitution, assaults and murders, and Fairbanks as a whole has a serious issue of property crime. Despite this, crime in Fairbanks and Alaska in general is almost always done by people who know each other and very rarely, if ever, targeted towards tourists. If you use common sense, chances are you won't run into any trouble.\n\nWhile Alaska is wild and beautiful, it does not tolerate fools easily. It is quite possible to get lost, cold, wet, and even die, all within sight of downtown Anchorage. The state's populace varies between extremely friendly to tourists and openly hostile. A common bumper sticker says: \"If it's tourist season, why can't we shoot 'em?\" Many Alaskans are understandably tired of those people from the \"lower 48\" who head North to live out ill-conceived &amp;mdash; and sometimes fatal &amp;mdash; fantasies of living off the land.\n\nThe remote parts of the state are its jewels, but be prepared for the trip you plan. Do your homework, and plan on being self-sufficient.  Consider using a guide, or checking out local conditions with locals before jumping in the kayak, and heading for yonder point that looked so nice on the map.  The water in Alaska is so cold, falling overboard can be fatal within minutes.  More importantly, self-rescue becomes impossible ''often within seconds'', especially around glacier-fed rivers.  Treatment for hypothermia is required reading before doing any water sports, even during warm weather.\n\nSouthern Alaska is on the Pacific Ring of Fire, the world's most seismically active region, so there's a risk for earthquakes.\n\nA word about Dangerous animals#Bears|bears: There's an old joke about how to determine if you are in bear country in Alaska. Take out a map of the state and make a circle around the downtown area of Anchorage. If you are outside the circle, you are in bear country. Although a humorous way of phrasing it, this is absolutely true. Assume bears are present in any area of Alaska, even if you do not see them. Both black and brown bears are present in Alaska. Polar bears are also present in the far north but you probably won't be going all the way into their territory. If you do, it would be wise to make peace with whatever higher power you may believe in before walking around anywhere without a very large gun. If you see large claw scratches on a tree you are in a bear's territory.  Be especially cautious just after sunset and  just before dawn. Never leave food, water, or garbage unattended outdoors or it may attract a bear. Bears are wild animals and their behavior can be capricious. Never approach a bear. Never run from a bear as it will see you as food and it can run faster than you. If you encounter a bear you should stand your ground. Make lots of noise and wave your arms. If you have any metallic objects bang them against one another. In most cases, even when bears charge humans, they do not attack. But if you run towards one, surprise it while it is eating, run from it, or get anywhere near a cub, the chances of an attack are greatly increased. While it is amazing to see bears, the safest thing for you and for them is to observe them quietly from a distance and never approach them closely. If you leave food or garbage out and a bear eats it, even if you don't see it happen you have endangered the bear's life. Studies have shown that the previously employed tactic of trapping and relocating bears that have become habituated was not effective: the bears either returned to the same areas eventually or sought other sources of human foods. So now \"trouble bears\" are killed by park rangers or law enforcement agencies instead.\n\nMoose are even more  common in most areas of the state, and are just as dangerous, and attack humans more frequently than bears. Moose may be herbivores and seem like slow-moving, lumbering animals, but they have sharp hooves and can strike with surprising speed and accuracy. Moose are not territorial, but they do have a strong desire to defend their \"personal space\" especially mothers with calves. Signs that indicate a moose is agitated include the laying back of their large ears, lowering the head, snorting and stomping their hooves. Unlike with bears, it is wisest to simply run if a moose acts aggressively towards you or charges. They just want you to leave them alone, so keep your distance.  Be aware of moose as well when driving. Every year dozens of moose are killed and many humans injured or killed by collisions between vehicles and moose. The long legs make it dangerous as often the bumper of the car will strike the moose only in the legs and its enormous body will impact the windshield, so slow down if moose are present: they sometimes get \"spooked\" by cars and will suddenly sprint in unpredictable directions.\n\nIf you are traveling with a dog, keep it restrained at all times. Dogs have been known to antagonize moose, wolves, and even  bears and are often injured by the quills of porcupines. It is no fun to pull little spikes out of a dog's face with a pair of pliers, so for the sake of both the wildlife and your dog, keep it under your control and don't let it run free.\n\nSee Wilderness backpacking#Stay safe|wilderness backpacking for more information about staying safe in areas of known bear activity.\n\n==Go next==\n\n* '''Yukon''' - Canada's Yukon shares most of Alaska's eastern border.\n* '''British Columbia''' - Portions of British Columbia share a border with the Alaska Panhandle.\n* '''Washington (state)|Washington''' - While not connected to Alaska, Washington is the departure point for many visitors to the state.\n* '''Russian Far East''' - Located just 53 miles (85&amp;nbsp;km) across the Bering Strait, Alaska's neighbor to the west has greatly influenced the state's history and culture, despite being, in fact, just out of viewing distance. Connections to Far Eastern Russia are rather scarce; aside from some flights in the summer, you will probably need to travel via East Asia.\n\n\n\n\n"

                "revision": {
                    "text": "\nThe '''Alaska Highway''' is the road connecting Alaska with the rest of North America.  It runs primarily through Canada.  This itinerary will cover the 2,232 km (1,387 mi) trip from Dawson Creek, British Columbia via the Yukon to Delta Junction, Alaska.  This is not a Sunday drive.\n\n==Understand== \n]]\nThis highway was built during World War II to help the American military transport equipment to and from Alaska.\n\n==Prepare== \n\nGet a copy of ''[http://www.themilepost.com/ The Milepost]'', either in print or eBook form. (Print would be a better idea once you hit the road.) Billing itself as \"the Bible of north country travel,\" this guide book covers the entire northwestern corner of North America in rich detail.\n\nGive your car a thorough mechanical evaluation before you attempt this trip. For winter driving, get winter or all-weather tires and low-weight oil (5W30 or as recommended by your manufacturer). Sign up for roadside service such as [https://aaa.com/ AAA]/[https://caa.ca CAA], but verify that they will cover the entire cost of towing you long distances. Many services will cover only a few hundred dollars, which is not sufficient.\n\n&lt;!-- info on cell phone coverage:\nhttp://www.tc.gov.yk.ca/cellphone_services_Yukon.html\nhttp://www.themilepost.com/features/faq-driving-the-alaska-highway\nhttps://www.icewireless.ca/ice-wireless-launches-3g-hspa-in-whitehorse-yukon/\nhttps://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/forums/americas-canada/canada/cellphone-data-coverage-sk-north-al-and-bc-yukon-and-nw-territories\n--&gt;\nCell phone coverage is very sparse. Although every Yukon community along the highway has cell service in the vicinity, do not count on using your cell phone in an emergency. You should carry enough emergency supplies to last yourself one or two nights. The nearest tow truck can be 1000 km (650 mi) away. It is even more important to carry emergency supplies in winter to avoid hypothermia and death. At the very least, bring food, water, blankets, a first-aid kit, and spare tires. Wintertime temperatures can dive as low as −40&amp;nbsp;°C / −40&amp;nbsp;°F. Bug repellent may be very nice to have in the summer.\n\nBe sure to verify that you have the appropriate entry documents for Canada or the United States, depending on your direction. Canadian immigration can request that you show proof of enough funds to cover your trip and an emergency. A bank/ATM receipt, a few credit cards, traveler's checks, or cash will suffice. They will refuse entry to Canada if you do not demonstrate enough funding for your trip. \n\nGas (petrol) stations in this part of Canada are frequently '''not''' open 24 hours, especially in winter, and most of them do not have a pay-at-the-pump mechanism. Many stations have very long distances between them. You should keep your tank as full as you can and be prepared to wait for a station to open if you arrive in the middle of the night.\n\nThe highway may be in various states of repair. Be prepared to wait a while as road crews continue to maintain the road. Winter frost is extremely hard on the roads. Do not be surprised to see deep fissures across the highway.\n\n==Get in== \n===By car===\n\nGetting to the Alaska Highway is no small feat in itself.  It starts in Dawson Creek in northern British Columbia.  You can get to Dawson Creek either by driving north from southern British Columbia through Prince George or by driving northwest from Edmonton, Alberta.\n\n===By plane===\n\nWhitehorse is the largest city along the highway, until you reach Fairbanks at the end. The Whitehorse airport  is served by [https://aircanada.com Air Canada], [https://www.flyairnorth.com Air North], and [https://www.westjet.com/ Westjet]. Nearly all of the flights are to or from Vancouver, with some schedules to Calgary and Edmonton. There is also summertime nonstop or one-stop service to Frankfurt, Germany, via [http://www.condor.com Condor airlines].\n\nDawson Creek, Fort Nelson, and Fort St. John have airports with schedule commercial flights, though Fort St. John has the most flights of those by far.  A renting car could be used for the drive, but renting RV would be more comfortable and convenient.  An RV is usually quite expensive and after the cost of gas, probably more expensive than staying in a hotel every night, but there a few hotels along the route between the few cities.\n\n===By bus===\nPortions of the Alaska Highway west of Tok and southeast of Fort Nelson have intercity bus services, but the remainder of the Alaska Highway, including the Yukon have no such services.\n* \n* \n* \n\n==Drive==\n\n\n]]\nThe only real possible way of doing this trip is driving.  Many travellers do this trip with a recreational vehicle (RV). \n\nAlthough Canada generally uses metric, most points along the Alaska Highway are identified by mileage:\n*  - Mile 0\n*  - Mile 47\n*  - Mile 101\n*  - Mile 283\n*  - Mile 437\n*  -  Mile 613 &lt;!-- see the :w:Sign Post Forest| --&gt;\n*  - Mile 887\n*  - Mile 985\n*  - Mile 1314\n*  - Mile 1422 \n\nRemember that you will have more than 20 hours of sunlight during the summer months and less than 5 hours of sunlight in the middle of winter.\n\nThere is mobile wireless service between Dawson Creek and 85 km west past Fort Nelson.  There is then no wireless service for around 400 km, until Watson Lake.  After Watson Lake, there is no wireless service for 200 km, until Teslin.  From Teslin, there is coverage along the majority of the way until near Burwash Creek (about 140 km from the Yukon-Alaska border), at which point there is no coverage until reaching the border community of Beaver Creek.  In Alaska, there is mobile wireless coverage along the route except for the 70 km nearest to the Yukon-Alaska border.\n\n===Alternate routes===\n\nRather than going west from Whitehorse, you can go north along the Klondike Highway to the Historic Gold Rush town of Dawson City, take the Top of the World Highway to the Alaska border at Poker Creek and then take the Taylor Highway back to the Alaska Highway.\n\nThe 720 km long Highway 37 (Stewart-Cassiar Highway), runs from Highway 16 (Yellowhead Highway) at Kitwanga, British Columbia to the Alaska Highway.  Highway 37 intersects with the Alaska Highway about 3 km north of the British Columbia-Yukon Border and 22 km west of Watson Lake, Yukon.   This route can save about 210 km (130 mi) for travellers coming from southern British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest of the contiguous United States, but due to the sparse population along the route, there is no mobile wireless service along Highway 37, except at either end of the highway.\n\n===Side trips===\n\nAt about Mile 837, you can turn south to Carcross and go to Skagway, famous as the gateway to the 1896-1899 Klondike Gold Rush. In summer, the Historic Whitepass &amp; Yukon Route Railway is operational as a historical tourist attraction, connecting Carcross and Skagway.  \n\nAnother sidetrip that leaves the Alaska highway at the same point is a trip to Atlin. Atlin is a small town in British Columbia that is only accessible from the Yukon.\n\n==Stay safe== \nFollow all advice in the Prepare section.\n\n==Go next== \n* The Alaska Marine Highway has service from the Anchorage area, south of Fairbanks.\n* About 105 km (66 miles) west of Alaska Highway's west terminus is the city of Fairbanks, the closest larger city near that end the highway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The town itself has little to offer of historic value, save for the beautiful old foot bridge, since it was built as a mining town, a fact which you won't be able to miss as you go past the massive mining works. The mine once wreaked massive environmental damage, which stopped for a while with the collapse of the USSR, but now it has restarted, albeit on a much smaller scale. You can drive to the Sarahart suburb, which is on top of the canyon cliffs, or you can walk up the ancient foot path which is past the bridge. The funniest, and perhaps most dangerous option though is the cable car, which takes the miners to and from work. Sarahart is adjacent to Sanahin Village, with the famous monastery, and the museum to the Migoyan brothers, with their extraordinary accomplishments of worldwide significance.\n\nAlthough accommodation options are somewhat limited, making the decision to stay a few nights in the area will allow you to much better appreciate and explore what Armenia has to offer, without sitting in a car all day back and forth from Yerevan.\n\nAlaverdi is surrounded by the following important suburbs and villages, which will also be considered in this article: , , , , and . Alaverdi itself is actually just a transport hub, and you are better off staying on top of the canyon.\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By marshrutka===\n* \n\nSpecific destinations:\n* Marshrutkas between Alaverdi and Vanadzor (1 hr, 500 dram), Stepanavan (2 hr, 700 dram), and Gyumri depart daily. To Vanadzor: 09:00, 10:30, 11:00, and 13:00.\n* Furthermore, almost all transport to and from Tbilisi passes through this town. A bus from Alaverdi to Tbilissi leaves every day at 11:30.\n* Yerevan (3 hr, 1,700 dram). There is one at 11:00.\n\n===By train===\n* \nTrain Yerevan-Tbilisi passes through Alaverdi.\n\n===By taxi===\nThere are numerous taxis waiting for your negotiations.\n\n===By thumb===\nIt is easy to get around and into the Alaverdi canyon.\n\n==Get around==\nThe Alaverdi town is built along the Debed River and easily walkable. To reach Sanahin and Sarahart take a taxi (1000 dram), marshrutka (100 dram), or just hitchhike. Everything along the canyon can be managed by hitchhiking, but taxis are abundant.\n\nAs of December 2019, the M-6 road around Alaverdi is under construction and in pretty bad shape. Some stretches are passable at max. 10 km/h.\n\n2024: The M-6 road isn't under construnction anymore, the road going up to Sanahin Sarahart is also newly paved and the asphalt is to continue to Akner village within approximately a year.\n\n===By marshrutka===\n* \n\nUseful marshrutka routes (the last go at 19:00):\n* Marshrutka #5 &amp;ndash; from the train station through the entire city along the Debed River.\n* Marshrutka #3 &amp;ndash; from the bus and train stations to ''Sanahin suburb'', every 30 min, 100 dram.\n* Marshrutka #063 &amp;ndash; between Alaverdi and ''Haghpat'', 200 dram\n:* Alaverdi to Haghpat: weekdays 08:15, 09:00, 10:30, 11:30, 13:30, 15:00, 16:30, 17:30, and weekend 09:00, 13:00, 17:00\n:* Haghpat to Alaverdi: weekdays 07:30, 08:35, 09:30, 11:00, 13:00, 14:05, 15:30, 17:00, and weekend 08:30, 12:00, 16:00\n\n* Marshrutka to Akhtala Monastery: 12:00, 300 dram.\n\n===By cable car===\nThere is a ''funicular'' (even though actually a cable car) between Alaverdi and Sarahart. The cable car operates at the following times: 07:00-10:00, 11:00-13:30, 15:00-19:30, and 23:00-00:30\n\nAs of 2019, the cable car is broken and locals are not confident on a timely repair.\n\n===By taxi===\nA taxi to '''Odzun''' is officially 1,500 dram, even though it is just 10 km. But it is uphill and often taxi drivers demand 2,000 dram from tourist. Do not fall for 2,000.\n\nOtherwise, the going rate, as always, is 100 dram per kilometre, at least when not climbing up.\n\nAlso it's possible to charter a taxi to Haghpat Monastery and Akhtala Monastery together for 5,000 dram. Or to Odzun church and Kobair Monastery together for 5,000 dram. But with the beautiful canyon landscape, you are better off hiking parts of the way. There is always enough taxis around to take one where you finish.\n\n==See==\n\n\n===In the town===\n* \n* \n* \n\n===Nearby ===\n\n*\n* \n\n* \nImage:Sanahin-raffi kojian-DCP 4513.JPG‎|thumb|Sanahin Monastery\n* \n\n===Far North===\n* \n*\n\n==Do==\n\n* Hike, bike, climb, camp, 4x4, photography....\n\n===Hiking===\n\n\nThere are many trails in the area that link monasteries with each other and with villages.

There are no guard rails, they are often slippery when wet, and it is possible to walk for hours without seeing anyone outside the villages. Additionally many of the plants here have needles or thorns. So plan ahead!\n\n==Connect==\nInternet can be found in most of the hotels and B&amp;Bs. Otherwise, use mobile 3G which signal is quite good here.\n\nThere are 2 mobile operator stores in town, VivaCell MTS and Ucom, both located near the bus station.

Under Roman rule, the area was the site of a town called Alba Pompeia. In the middle ages, the town was part of the Lombard league. For the next several centuries, parts of the region were invaded, occupied, and annexed by small Italian states, Spain, the Duchy of Savoy, and France, being secured as part of the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1814. In the last years of World War II, when Italy was torn by a violent civil war between fascists and anti-fascists, local partisans declared Alba to be a republic independent from fascist rule, though this independence only lasted a few weeks. Today, the town is known for its historic churches and UNESCO-recognized gastronomy.\n\n==Get in==\n\n\n\nFrom Turin hourly trains run from all the main terminals (1hr, ).\n\n==Get around==\nAlba is small enough that you can walk easily from place to place, though you'll see locals occasionally using bicycles or motorbikes.\n\n==See==\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Do==\nIn late spring, usually from late May to early June, Alba is the location of a two-week classical music festival featuring mostly Italian and American performances of vocal and choral works, chamber music, and orchestral music in the city's medieval churches.

For the Brazilian state with the same postal abbreviation, see Alagoas; for the U.S. state, see Alabama.''\n'''Albania''' (Albanian phrasebook|Albanian: ''Shqipëria'') is a country in the Balkans|Balkan region of Europe with unspoiled beaches, mountainous landscapes, traditional cuisine, archaeological artefacts, unique traditions, low prices and the wild atmosphere of the countryside. It is one of the sunniest countries in Europe. The country has an extensive archaeological heritage; it was part of Ancient Greece, the Roman Empire and the Ottoman Empire until its first declaration of independence in 1912, becoming a kingdom and then a communist dictatorship before becoming a democratic republic. Albania is one of just a few Islam|Muslim majority nations in Europe.\n\n==Regions==\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==Cities==\n*  (Tiranë) — the capital. Trees and mountains surround the city. Mount Dajt is a popular tourist site for a great view of the city.\n*  - Albania's second-largest city and largest port, with historic ruins, current-day cultural institutions and beaches.\n*  — Thought to be one of the oldest towns in Albania, it is a new member of the UNESCO world heritage list. Berat has long been known as the \"city of 1001 windows\" because of its unique Ottoman/Albanian architecture. It has a well preserved castle with residents still living inside its protective walls.\n*  — Lively seaside city, and only about 8&amp;nbsp;km (5&amp;nbsp;mi) away from the ruins of the ancient Illyrian city of Apollonia.\n*  — another UNESCO city, located in the south is known for its unique Ottoman period architecture. There is a large castle on the hill in the middle of the city which served as a jail for many generations. A Military Museum and Art Gallery are now located inside. Gjirokastër is also the birthplace of former communist Leader, Enver Hoxha, as well as Albania's most internationally famous author, Ismail Kadare, their homes now serve as museums.\n*  (Korça) — Located in southeast Albania, several miles from the Greek border, this city is full of life during the summer when you can find couples and families strolling through the city's main park, Parku Rinia. You can hike to the top of the beautiful mountain Moravia and view the city and its surrounding landscape. Don't miss the Korça Brewery (famous throughout Albania) which sponsors a week long Beer Festival every August!\n*  (Krujë) — ancient city of the national hero Skanderbeg. It consists of beautiful mountains; Skanderbeg's castle is now a museum. Kruje also contains an old style bazaar with shops selling traditional goods amid cobblestone streets. Kruje is known for its carpet craftworks.\n*  — the biggest town in Northern Albania. Shkodër is considered the capital of Albanian culture. The local \"Migjeni\" Theatre was the first in Albania and also held the first cyclic race,  the first football match and is where the first Albanian photograph was developed (by Marubi). The Rozafa Castle is a major tourist attraction here, but also \"The Great Cathedral\", \"The mosque Ebu Beker\" and several others.\n*  — Lively seaside city, nice beaches south of town. Passenger ferries to and from Italy dock here.\n\n==Other destinations==\n\n\n\n*  — This mountainous complex on the north of the country forms the border between Albania and Montenegro. Rich on rainfalls, sheep, bare rocks and scenic views it is one of the places in Albania you should see. One of the places where you can be less than 10&amp;nbsp;km away from the nearest village and still have a day long trip there.\n*  — Featuring crystal clear waters, unspoiled beaches, and picturesque villages, this is the Mediterranean coastline as it once was.\n*  — One of the finest of the many beaches along the coastal road between Vlore and Saranda, perfect for camping.\n*  — Largest archaeological site from Greek era in Albania. It lies on the coast in the southernmost tip of the country, near the Greek border. Minibuses are available from Saranda.\n*  — A 20,242&amp;nbsp;hectare national park with high mountains, big meadows, and glacial lakes.\n*  contains Albania's share of Lake Prespa, which forms Prespa National Park. This is also an area of much history, evidenced by the multiple cave churches found near its villages as well as on the island of Maligrad.\n*  — National park and village in Northern Albania.\n*  — Mountain ridge in the southern part of Albania, not far from Berat. This part of the country is formed by parallel mountain ridges (up to around 2000–2500&amp;nbsp;m) separated by valleys. Although the ridges are not very long, they offer few days of hiking with enormous scenic beauty and fantastic panoramic views. Tomorri is one of the most known ridges with a Bektash monastery and chapel on the very top.\n\n==Understand==\n\nWhile the relative majority of the people in Albania are of Muslim heritage (55-65%), according to the polls, around 35% of the Albanians are agnostics; 22% are atheists; 19% are Muslim; 15% are Orthodox; 8% are Catholics and 1% are of other religions. Mixed marriages are very common.\n\nTraditional Albanian culture honors the role and person of the guest. In return for this place of honor, respect is expected from the guest. Albanians enjoy long walks in the city streets, drinking coffee, and among the younger generations, participating in nightlife activities such as cafe lounging and dancing.\n\nAlbania is a poor country by European standards.\n\nThe English name Albania comes from ''Albanoi'', the Greek name of an Illyrian tribe which lived in the area in during antiquity. Albanians call their own country ''Shqipëria'', which means \"Land of the Eagles\". The name comes from an old myth that Albanians descend from a black eagle. A double headed black eagle was used as an insignia by the \"Father of the Nation\", Skanderbeg, as early as the 15th century, and can still be seen on the country's flag.\n\n===History===\nBeginning in 1385, the Ottoman Empire was able to take control of what is now Albania. In 1443, a revolt started, led by George Kastrioti Skanderbeg. This revolt was stamped out only in 1479. The end of Ottoman rule in Albania occurred in 1912, and Albania became a country again.\n\nIn 1939, Albania was conquered by Fascist Italy and was subsequently occupied by Nazi Germany. Albanians very effectively shielded their small local Jewish population and a few hundred foreign Jews, giving Albania the distinction of being the only country occupied by the Nazis to end World War II with more Jews than before the war.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the Axis powers at the end of World War II, a Communist government was established, presided over by resistance leader Enver Hoxha. Albania was known for its isolation, not just from the market-run democracies of Western Europe but from the Soviet Union, China, and even neighboring Yugoslavia. Hoxha also declared Albania to be the first \"atheist state\", and thus the anti-clericalism found in many communist parties was even more pronounced in Albania. Even as the Iron Curtain came down and communists lost power throughout Eastern and Central Europe, Albania seemed intent on staying the course, alone.\n\nBut in 1992, several years after the death of Hoxha, the Communist Party relinquished power and Albania established a multi-party democracy with a coalition government. The transition was difficult at first, as governments tried to deal with high unemployment, a dilapidated infrastructure, widespread organized crime, and disruptive political opponents. Catalyzed by the failure of a widespread pyramid scheme, a civil war broke out in 1997, resulting in UN intervention. Today Albania is moving closer towards neo-liberalism, with EU integration as its goal; Albania signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU in 2006, and became an official candidate country in 2014, thus completing the first major step towards joining. In 2008, Albania received an invitation to join NATO and joined that alliance.\n\n===Climate===\nWith its coastline facing the Adriatic and Ionian seas, its highlands backed upon the elevated Balkan landmass, and the entire country lying at a latitude subject to a variety of weather patterns during the winter and summer seasons, Albania has a high number of climatic regions for so small an area. The coastal lowlands have typically Mediterranean weather; the highlands have a Mediterranean continental climate. In the lowlands and the interior, the weather varies markedly from north to south.\n\nThe lowlands have mild winters, averaging about 7°C (45°F). Summer temperatures average 24°C (75°F). In the southern lowlands, temperatures average about 5°C (9°F) higher throughout the year. The difference is greater than 5°C (9°F) during the summer and somewhat less during the winter.\n\nInland temperatures are affected more by differences in elevation than by latitude or any other factor. Low winter temperatures in the mountains are caused by the continental air mass that dominates the weather in Eastern Europe and the Balkans. Northerly and northeasterly winds blow much of the time. Average summer temperatures are lower than in the coastal areas and much lower at higher elevations, but daily fluctuations are greater. Daytime maximum temperatures in the interior basins and river valleys are very high, but the nights are almost always cool.\n\nAverage precipitation is heavy, a result of the convergence of the prevailing airflow from the Mediterranean Sea and the continental air mass. Because they usually meet at the point where the terrain rises, the heaviest rain falls in the central uplands. Vertical currents initiated when the Mediterranean air is uplifted also cause frequent thunderstorms. Many of these storms are accompanied by high local winds and torrential downpours.\n\n===Holidays===\n* 1 January: New Year's Day\n* 7 March: Teacher's Day\n* 14 March: Summer Festival\n* Easter (moveable)\n* Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha (Islamic high holidays)\n* 19 October: Mother Teresa Day\n* 28 November: Independence Day\n* 29 November: Liberation Day\n* 8 December: Youth Day\n* 25 December: Christmas\n\n===Visitor information ===\n* [https://www.albania.al Albania National Tourism Agency]\n\n==Get in==\nAll road and tourist taxes (upon entering or leaving) the country have been lifted as of 2021.\n\n===Entry requirements===\n\nThere is no longer a visa charge for any foreigners entering Albania.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, nationals of the following countries/territories can enter Albania without a visa:\nAndorra, Argentina, Armenia, Australia*, Austria*, Azerbaijan, Belgium *, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria*, Canada*, Chile, Croatia, Cyprus*, Czech Republic*, Denmark*, Estonia*, Finland*, France*, Germany*, Greece*, Holy See, Hong Kong SAR, Hungary*, Ireland*, Iceland*, Israel, Italy*, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Latvia*, Liechtenstein, Lithuania*, Luxembourg*, Malaysia, Malta*, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands*, New Zealand*, North Macedonia, Norway*, Poland*, Portugal*, Romania*, San Marino*, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia*, Slovenia*, South Korea, Spain*, Sweden*, Switzerland*, Taiwan (Republic of China), Turkey, United Kingdom*, USA*, Ukraine.\n\n(Passport-holders from countries with an asterisk can enter with an ID card.)\n\nStates whose citizens may enter without visas due to their visa liberalization with Schengen area: Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Brunei, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, Mauritius, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, El Salvador, Seychelles, St. Kitts and Nevis, Uruguay, Venezuela, Macao (China). \n\nForeigners who possess a valid residence permit or multi-entry visa from one of the Schengen states, the United Kingdom, and the United States are also allowed to enter Albania without a visa for a stay of up to 90 days (for staying more than 90 days within the period of six months, they need to get visa type D). However, this policy has not been systematically applied. There have been instances that travelers have been turned away based on their nationality even while holding valid residency in one of the above countries, this even when they were previously allowed entry. So have contingencies if you fall under this category.\n\n===By plane===\nTirana's '''Tirana#By plane|\"Mother Teresa\" International Airport''' () is 15 minutes drive from the city. It is served by numerous European carriers such as British Airways, ITA Airways, Lufthansa, Austrian, and the low cost carriers Wizz Air and Ryanair. There is a large and modern terminal and a tourist information center.\n\nAnother cheaper and convenient way to reach the Albanian Riviera in Southern Albania is by flying to '''Corfu''' () and taking the hydrofoil to Saranda.\n\nFurthermore, '''PRN|Pristina International Airport''' () in Kosovo with many connections is just 3-4 hr or €15 from Tirana. Other options are the airports in Skopje, Ohrid and Podgorica.\n\nA second main airport in Albania is under construction in '''Vlorë''', which is supposed to become the main hub for the Albanian Riviera.\n\n'''KFZ|Kukës International Airport''' () has no flights as of February 2024.\n\n===By train===\nIt is not possible to visit Albania by train. The only international connection, Podgorica–Shkoder, is freight only. See the following section for domestic trains.\n\n===By bus===\n\nYou can reach Tirana by coach from\n* Istanbul, Turkey – 20 hr, €35 one-way\n* Athens, Greece – 12 hr, €30-35\n* Tetovo, North Macedonia – 7 hr, €15\n* Prishtina, Kosovo – 4½ hr, €10\n* Sofia, Bulgaria – 12 hr, €35\n* Germany – 22-26 hr, €80-120\n\nCheck out Tirana#By bus itself for more information on international connections.\n\n==== From Montenegro ====\nThere are 3 daily buses from Ulcinj in Montenegro to Shkodër. They depart at 07:00, 12:30 and 16:30 at Ulcinj bus station and traveling time is between 2 and 3 hours depending on the time needed to cross the border. The 12:30 bus tend to get full very quickly during the high season. Shared taxis (mini-busses) are also an option to go to Albania from Ulcinj. They depart from the parking place next to the market in Ulcinj. It goes at 13:00 and costs €5; it takes 1½ hr. The stop is not marked, a reservation can only be made by finding the driver in the cafe at the corner of the parking place. Ask around and be persistent, as not all the locals know about this.\n\nThere are also scheduled buses twice a day from Kotor (Montenegro) to Tirana, passing through Budva, Podgorica (both in Montenegro), and Shkodër.\n\n==== From Greece ====\nThere are buses running daily from Ioannina to the border at Kakavia (9 daily, €5.70, 1&amp;nbsp;hour). From there it's a short walk between the Greek and Albanian checkpoints. Just make sure you don't delay, as the furgon (minibus) to Gjirokastra won't wait for one extra passenger and you will be forced to haggle with predatory cab drivers. In Gjirokaster you can buy a bus ticket to Athens, Greece or anywhere in between. The buses are new, cheap, air conditioned, and stop along some gas stations\n\nThere are buses running daily from Igoumenitsa to the border at Mavromati (3 daily, € 3,50, 45 minutes). From there it's a short walk between the Greek and Albanian checkpoints. After that there are taxis driving to Butrint (10-15 €) or Saranda.\n\n====From Germany====\n* Deva Tours (+355673835770, +38344128770) has buses every 2-3 days or so, and costs €90 between Munich and Tirana. The buses are actually to and from Northrhine-Westphalia.\n* Zagoria Travel (+355674542627, +355699386358) also has buses every 2-3 days or so, and costs €80 between Munich and Tirana. Likewise, buses are actually to and from Northrhine-Westphalia.\n\n===By boat===\n* Ferries to Durrës arrive from Bari (9 hr, daily, €50), Ancona (19 hr, triweekly, €70) and Trieste (14 hr, weekly, only during high season). [https://www.adriaferries.com/en/timetable-and-prices-of-ferries.html Full price information]\n* A high-speed service operates from Bari (3 hr, €60).[http://www.apdurres.com.al]\n* There is also a reliable overnight ferry service operated by [http://www.europeanseaways.com European Seaways] from Brindisi to Vlore.\n* Ferries from Corfu to Saranda every day.[http://www.portisarande.com.al]\n* Ferry between Brindisi and Shengjin by [http://www.europeanseaways.com European Seaways] operating twice a week in the summer (2015).\n\n* \n\n===By car===\n\nTo enter the country, ensure that your International Motor Insurance Card (called Green Card) is valid for Albania (AL) along with the Vehicle Registration and a Power of Attorney from the owner if the car is not yours. The border guards are very strict about allowing cars through without these documents. Be sure to print those out, since border guards are quite reluctant to recognize small text PDFs on your phone.\n\n'''The road between Ioannina, Greece and Tirana''' (E853/SH4) is of sufficient quality. Construction works between Tepelene and Fier are mostly finished (2014). The new portion between Rrogozhine and Durres is also mostly complete (2014). This is the main north–south route between Montenegro and Greece.\n\n'''The road between Krystallopigi (Greece) and Billisht''' is of very good quality. On the Greek side there is a paid 2-lane highway A29, which has very small traffic. The Albanian side has COVID-19 testing labs. The Greek border control tests all people for antibodies upon entering (as of November 2021).\n\n'''The road between Struga, North Macedonia and Tirana (E852/SH3)''' is of a sufficient quality. There are a lot of slow moving vehicles along the curvy mountainous route so extra caution must be exercised especially around corners or during over-taking. A new motorway is being constructed between Elbasan and Tirana (2011).\n\n'''The road between Prizren (Kosovo) and Tirana (Albania)''' (E851/A1/SH5) is to the levels of quality found in other parts of Europe. Extra caution should be exercised along some bridges near the Kosovo border, as they have not been widened while uncontrolled access points are becoming dangerous. Also beware that cows run free on the motorway: there is no fence and before dusk they return home using the motorway itself.\n\n'''The road between Shkoder (border of Montenegro) and Tirana (E762/SH1)''' is of sufficient quality for driving but there are a lot of slow moving vehicles and uncontrolled access points so extra caution must be exercised especially during over-taking. A portion between Milot and Thumane has been widened to dual carriageway standard.\n\n'''There are two border control points in the north of Albania with Montenegro.''' The narrow windy road from Ulcinj, Montenegro to Shkoder via Muriqan/Sukobin (E851/SH41) is used mainly by locals. There is a new Montenegrin section near the Albanian border. However, it is worth a try to avoid heavier traffic on the newly built main road (E762/SH1) between Hani Hotit and Shkoder. Ask any police officer to point you in the right direction from Shkoder. They are helpful, courteous and friendly.\n\n===By taxi===\nAlbania is geographically a small country and as such it is possible to leave by taxi.\n\nA taxi from downtown Pogradec to North Macedonia's border at Sveti Naum is about €5 (and less than 10 minutes). After Albanian exit procedures, walk about 500 m down the road to the North Macedonia border control. The beautiful Sveti Naum church is very close by, and from there you can get a bus north around the lake to Ohrid (110 Macedonian denars). (prices April 2010)\n\nA taxi from Ulcinj in Montenegro to Shkoder in northern Albania costs about €30. It takes 1 hr. You do not have to change at the border, the taxi will bring you all the way (2010).\n\nSome taxis can take you into Greece; however most will not go further than Ioannina.\n\n==Get around==\n\n===By bus===\nBuses and ''furgons'' (minibuses) are generally the best method for travelling within Albania. They run on a time schedule and are generally well regulated. There are few bus companies, but many are operated by individual drivers. Drivers are supposed to leave when it's time, but sometimes they leave earlier when full. So, arrive sufficiently ahead of time. They are not in the best of shape, but buses are generally more comfortable and cheaper.\n\nWhether there will be a ''furgons'' or a bus running to or from a specific destination depends on the destination and the time of the day. So, there isn't really a choice.\n\nFurgons often provide access to some smaller towns where buses don't frequently run. ''Furgon'' stations there aren't always in obvious locations, so you can ask around to find them, or keep an eye out for groups of white or red minivans gathered together. Destination place names are generally displayed on the dashboard, prices are never posted (but to get an idea, Tirane to Vlore is about 600 lek, or check the website below).\n\nFrom Tirana, many buses and ''furgons'' a day depart to Shkodër, Durres, Elbasan, Fier and Berat. ''Furgons'' departing to the south like Gjirokaster or Saranda tend to depart fairly early in the morning. Check out the schedules under Tirana#By bus.\n\nA good website to find the latest bus times (and prices), even for cross border transport, is '''[https://gjirafa.com/Autobus gjirafa.com]'''. Prices are indicative and each bus (driver) should have a proper stack of tickets with him, where you could identify the right price. Note that city names of other countries might be spelled differently in Albanian when searching. So, not finding a city does not mean that there is no connection.\n\n===By train===\nAll passenger trains seem to have been suspended since COVID and due to budget issues.\n&lt;!-- Keeping all the information here, in case the trains will ever be restarted.\n\nfile:October_2021_Train_Time_Table.jpg|thumb|Train Schedule (as of Oct 2021)\nAlthough Albania's railway network is the youngest in Europe, the tracks and rolling stock are in poor condition. Nonetheless this should not deter you from taking trains within Albania, as doing so is an experience in itself. The railway operator has imposed a 45 km/h limit on trains due to the condition of the tracks, so you ought not worry about any accidents. Though travelling by bus is more popular and convenient, trains offer more space than often overloaded minibuses.\n\nA train ride is a must-do, as there are few such enjoyments in Europe these days. Tickets are very cheap (as little as €2) and the journeys can take a few hours, but the views and the atmosphere are usually priceless. Among the things you will see on your journey are people manually toiling the land, beautiful landscapes and wild terrain, houses under construction in very close vicinity to the track, a chance to meet locals on the train. In most stations you'll find people selling sunflower seeds, fruits, chewing gum and many other different things - very unusual in Europe. Unofficial sellers are known to jump aboard offering drinks and snacks.\n\n'''Because all lines run via Durrës, the train is a great option from there'''. Although passenger services to Fier are suspended (as of Jan 2021), you can take the Elbasan train as far as Rrogozhinë and then by bus from there. If you're in Tirana, taking the train to Elbasan (30 km apart) would require you to travel via Durres, so unless you have a lot of time on your hands, taking a bus is much more sensible. \n\nA very limited passenger service is in operation. An unofficial [https://www.facebook.com/HSHALBANIA Facebook] page provides regular updates on passenger services. The pictures on this page will give you a good insight into what's to be expected. You should verify all times/info at the train station. The main passenger routes are as follows: \n\n* '''Durres - Tirana (Kashar)''' (two daily trains each way)\n* '''Durres - Elbasan''' (two daily trains each way)\n* '''Durres - Shkoder''' (suspended as of November 2020 due to damaged bridge)\n* '''Durres - Fier''' (no service in 2020)\n\n'''Schedule''' see picture to the right.\n--&gt;\n\n===By car===\n\nThe roads between the important destinations have been repaved and fixed, and offer most of the security measures one would expect on a highway. However be aware that some highways are not fully completed, and contain uncontrolled entry-exit points. There are no fees for using the highways.\n\nBeware of minor roads. Road surfaces can be poor, deeply pitted, or non-existent, and sometimes a decent paving can suddenly disappear, necessitating a U-turn and lengthy doubling-back. It seems all the expensive cars in Albania are SUVs, rather than low-slung sports cars - and for good reason. Ask the locals in advance if travelling away from a highway.\n\nHighways have frequent changes in speed limit (sometimes with little apparent reason). And there are frequent police mobile speed checks. Police will also stop you if you have not turned on your car lights.\n\nCar-driving behavior on the highways is not as orderly as elsewhere in Europe. Expect cars to pull out in front of you, little use of indicators, and hair-raising overtaking. Lanes on dual or triple carriageways tend to be observed. Also expect pedestrians, horses or donkeys cross highways or walk on them. In the mountains, roads can be quite tight and windy with hairpins and serpentines requiring frequent gear shifting and braking. Drivers are encouraged to always keep a spare tire in case of emergency, and check engine coolant levels to avoid overheating.\n\nNavigation is pretty easy although some maps of the country are out of date or contain errors. It is strongly recommended to have an up to date GPS, as new roads are being constantly added to the Albanian road network. In case the GPS does not work, its good to have an alternative good paper or internet-based map.\n\nIn the cities, and especially Tirana, many roads are being upgraded, fixed, and renamed. Because of that, traveling by car inside the city will be slow and difficult. Tirana suffers from great traffic congestion during mornings and midday.\n\nA very nice ride is the SH8 Vlorë-Saranda mountain road. It is a typical Mediterranean road and offers an amazing view of the sea from the mountains. The road to the top of Dajti mountain is very bad, though does not (just about) require a 4x4.\n\nBeggars and beggar children may approach your car at major stop lights. Nudge slightly forward to get them off your car and if necessary go into the traffic intersection to get rid of them. The locals will understand.\n\nAround Greek holiday seasons, including Orthodox Easter, the roads leading to/from Greece can be crowded with cars with Greek plates of Albanian immigrants going to Albania or returning to Greece after their holidays.\n\nRenting a car is a good option to choose, but the practice is fairly new in the country. Rental companies are available mainly in Tirana Airport, and Tirana proper. Various travel agencies may offer such services as well.\n\n====Rules====\nEnsure you travel with driving licenses and insurance documents (ask your car hire company for these) to present to the police.\n\nThere are no toll roads in Albania.\n\nSnow chains are allowed in conjunction with summer tires from 1 November to 30 April. They must be present on at least 2 driving wheels. Snow chains are only allowed if the road is completely covered with snow or ice. Studded tires are permitted. The use of winter tires is optional.\n\nDipped headlights are not mandatory for daytime driving, but are mandatory when driving at night or when visibility is poor due to bad weather conditions.\n\nThe maximum permitted level of alcohol is 0.1‰ (0.01%).\n\n===By bicycle===\n\n\nThere is a lack of respect for people riding on bikes on most streets. Also, there are few places to put your bike. These and other challenges make Albania a difficult cycling destination, but a rewarding one. Often, asking around to see if you can stay in somebody's home or camp in their garden is the only option. Check out Hospitality exchange|hospitality services in Albania, some have an existing community, and it is easy to find places to stay.\n\nFood and water are easily available in the frequent roadside cafes and bars.\n\nCamping on public land is allowed, and even on private land you shouldn't encounter any problems, although you should ask the owner if you're not sure.\n\nIt's very hard to get parts or repairs for modern bicycles outside of Tirana.\n\n===By thumb===\nAlbania is quite good for hitchhiking, even though locals rarely do it. For women it is generally safe to hitchhike, but it is a good idea to have an alibi ready, when the question about whether one is married comes up. While Albanian men are respectful towards women and Albanian culture is all about family and honor, a single woman is most certainly an invitation to flirting.\n\nThe best way to obtain a ride is to wait by the side of the highway where there is open space for a car to easily pull off from, and use your whole hand to point down the road in the direction you want to go&amp;mdash;the thumb is not that common.\n\nLike anywhere, exercise normal caution and don't hitchhike at night or in the 'wrong part of town'. Good info on what it's like to hitch in Albania can be found [https://hitchwiki.org/en/Albania here].\n\nAlso, watch out for any Hitchhiking#Scams|Scams by soliciting taxi drivers.\n\n===By taxi===\nTaxis are abundant all over Albania. There are also unofficial ones which can save you some money and can be a good option at night to get around and even to and from the airport (at night), even from Shkodër, but be careful with them.\n\n'''Unofficial taxis''' (e.g. at night or to remote places): Be very careful, especially as a tourist you are a walking invitation to scams. Be clear on what the agreed price is (per person!), only pay in the end, have the exact change ready, and never give the driver more money if not at the same time he gives you back the change (and not less!). It is common that the price suddenly inflates during the ride, or the driver does not remember anymore what he agreed on. That is all BS—don't get tricked. If the situation escalates, seek the help of other locals (but not other taxi drivers!). And never ever give him any money in expectation you will get back the correct change.\n\n==See==\n\n\n\n\nAlbania has varied cultural influences. In the south you can see the legacy of the Turks and Greeks, whereas in the north you can see many ancient Illyrian ruins.\n\n* '''The Coastal Albania|coastline''' is always a place to go, with its clear turquoise seas, and its many islands cast upon it, like in Saranda, the southern most coastal city in Albania. Along the Albanian Riviera, from Vlore to about Qeparo there exist mainly wooden villa complexes, bed and breakfasts, camping sites and a few beach resorts as accommodation facilities. Llogara Pass is a mountain pass located near Llogara National Park offering a majestic view of the riviera from above. Nearby is found Cesar's Pass, the place where Julius Cesar passed in his pursuit of Pompey.\n* '''Dajti Mountain''', a popular sight in Tirana allows you to get a whole green view of the capital.\n* The ancient '''Illyrian city of Apollonia''' is only about 8&amp;nbsp;km (5&amp;nbsp;mi) away from Fier.\n* A walk around southern cities like Butrint, a UNESCO world heritage site, is always ideal and memorable. Butrint is home to many '''ancient ruins'''.\n* '''Castles''' are in many cities in Albania. Their beauty reminds anyone of the ancient times of Albania, and the world. There is Petrela Castle near Tirana, Rozafa castle in Shkodër, the inhabited castle of Berat, and Skanderbeg Castle in Kruje, (named after the national hero and now a popular museum holding his belongings).\n* Albania has thousands upon thousands of '''bunkers''', many of which are scattered in cities and across the countryside.\n\n==Do==\n===Beaches and swimming===\nIncluding various lagoons and harbors, the coast stretches for a total of 450 km and touches two seas: the Ionian in the south and the Adriatic in the north.\n* Half of the coastline stretching to the north of Vlore and up to the Montenegrin border (at the Buna River delta) is washed by Adriatic Sea. It contains fine-grained sandy beaches, sloping gently into the water, which makes them ideal for families with children. But the water is murky green and not suited for snorkeling. There are almost no algae or jellyfish near the coast. Due to the shallow depth, the water warms up well, so the beach season in local resorts starts early, in the first weeks of May. \n* While the Albanian Riviera stretching south of Vlore washed by Ionian sea up to the Albanian-Greek border with Stillo Cape. It is made up of rocky beaches and steep sea bottom, but the water is crystal clear and has turquoise color.\n\nThe entire coastline and beaches belong to municipalities and is free and open to anyone. But sun loungers and umbrellas are paid here and belong to restaurants located somewhere nearby. For a day, you will have to pay around €3 for one set. But no one can prohibit sitting on the sand on one's towel or bedspread under one's own umbrella. During the high season in July and August beaches are cramped with locals and tourists, but on the 1st of September you would see very few people swimming - although water temperature is still around 23—25°C, apparently it's too cold for locals.\n\n===Mountains===\nAlmost two-thirds of Albania's geography is either hilly or mountainous. These enable outdoor recreation potential and of course impressive '''off-road cycling'''. There is a renewed interest in adventurer tourism in Albanian famous attractions—even tough, most Albanians stick to pre-organised 4WD trips for the weekend for that matter. Various destinations in the Northern Alps, with elevations as high as 2,700 m, beckon to all types of “adventure seekers”. Specifically, the towns of Vermosh, Thethi, Razëm, Bogë, and Valbona can all serve as destination points for expeditions.\n\n===Hiking===\nMeanwhile many official hiking trails exist in Albania. The most popular region for hiking is Thethi with many accommodation options, but you can also find excellent trails around  (Mount Korab), Përmet (Zagoria Valley), Dhërmi (Lloraga National Park), and  (Golem Pass). For reliable maps, GPS navigation, comprehensive trails and map information, consult [https://openstreetmap.org OpenStreetMap], also used by this travel guide and by many mobile Apps like [https://osmand.net/ OsmAnd] or [https://en.mapy.cz/ Mapy.cz]. Or just download the according GPX or KML files through [https://hiking.waymarkedtrails.org/ Waymarked Trails] for such trails on OpenStreetMap. (Note, you just need to change the OpenStreetMap relation ID to download the GPX or KML files through the same link.)\n\n===Thermal springs and baths===\n\nAlbania has numerous hot springs and a mentionable thermal and spa culture. While this industry has suffered in the 21st century, many sites can be visited all around Albania.\n* The spa towns Elbasan#Llixhat|Llixhat and Tregan near Elbasan with numerous spa hotels.\n* The thermal river pools of Përmet#Banjat e Benjës|Benjë near Përmet.\n* The thermal baths of Northeastern Albania#Thermal springs and baths|Kozani-8 well south of Tirana.\n* The spa facilities in Peshkopi.\n* The many natural hot springs all around the country like Southeastern Albania#Thermal springs and baths|Holta, Postenan and Sarandoporo (also interesting nature destination) as well as Northeastern Albania#Thermal springs and baths|Shupali and Mamurras (less popular/known).\n\nThere are many more, but the hottest ones are listed above.\n\nA great read on the topic, if you want to discover more, is \"Thermal and Mineral Waters of Albania\" by Romeo Eftimi and Alfred Frashëri (ISBN: 978-99943-2-346-3).\n\n==Talk==\n\nThe official language of the country is '''Albanian phrasebook|Albanian'''. Like Greek and Armenian, Albanian forms its own branch within the Indo-European language family. \n\n'''Italian phrasebook|Italian''' is often considered the best-known foreign language in Albania. Italian was extensively taught in Albanian schools during the 1930s. \n\n* '''English''' is understood in Tirana and to a lesser extent in frequented tourist cities.\n* '''Greek''' can be encountered in the southernmost areas of the country. Albania has a lot of immigrants in Greece, from which around 200,000 people have returned and now live in Albania. Albania is also home to an ethnic Greek minority.\n* '''Macedonian''' is also occasionally understood in areas near Pogradec and Korca.\n\nFrom a country of 3 million, there have been about 1.2 million emigrants, and many of them have returned to Albania from countries such as Germany, France, Greece (especially those in the south of Albania) and Italy so you'll find a lot of people who speak the respective languages. Older people may speak Russian phrasebook|Russian as it was a compulsory second language in schools during the communist era.\n\n==Buy==\n===Money===\n\n\nThe national currency is the '''lek''' (plural ''lekë'', symbol '''L''', ISO code: ALL). During the communist regime, the government redenominated the ''old lek'' into the ''new lek'' at a ratio of 1 to 10 (replaced previous Lek banknotes with new ones, 1,000 old lek became 100 new lek). According to a 2021 survey, despite the change taking place in 1965, the majority (80%) of citizens still use the logic of “old lek” in their language and when doing business, leading to a great confusion for both locals and tourists. For instance, for \"200 lek\" they would say ''dy mijë lek'', literally meaning two thousand lek — the word 'mijë' is similar to the Latin 'mil'. The survey also revealed that almost 30% of financial institutions workers use the term, and 40% of public administration. Nevertheless, most prices are displayed in \"new lek\" nowadays.\n\nCoins of Albania are issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 lekë. Although, you will barely or never encounter 1 lek coins. Banknotes of Albania are issued in denominations of 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000 and 10,000 lekë.\n\n====ATMs====\nATMs are available in most major cities. Use the [https://www.mastercard.com/us/personal/en/cardholderservices/atmlocations/index.html MasterCard ATM Locator] or [https://www.visa.com/atmlocator/index.jsp Visa ATM Locator] to find them. The ATMs accept most international Visa and MasterCard credit/debit cards.\n\nAll ATMs charge a withdrawal fee of 500–1,400 lek (abi and UnionBank vs. otpbank) for international debit and credit cards—even Credins Bank as of July 2023.\n\n====Credit cards====\nCredit cards are widely accepted, even for small purchases, especially at supermarket chains. However, many smaller shops and stalls accept cash only. You may find that the acceptance of cards is quite \"random\": some restaurants in a chain may accept cards while others do not. Many coffee shops and restaurants even in the most central areas of Tirana do not accept cards, and even if cards are accepted in a store and it has Visa/Mastercard signs, they might not accept them at certain hours or if their payments processor is out of service. It is therefore wise to always have cash on hand.\n\n====Currency exchange====\nExchanging money in Albania is quite easy and competitive, especially in Tirana. Most exchange places in Tirana will give you rates for euros, dollars or pounds that are comparable to your bank. All major currencies are accepted, Bosnian convertible mark is not though—oddly enough, since its exchange risk is equal to the Euro.\n\n===Shopping===\nThe euro is very widely accepted and such a request to pay in euro is met with understanding and sometimes eager. If you don't speak Albanian or Italian, then the easiest way to haggle or ask for the price is to show hundreds of leks with your fingers—the locals would understand, you're not the first one not understanding their language.\n\nAlbanian shops are open at 09:00-20:00 usually, and until 22:00 at summer. Most of the shops open on Sunday.\n\nIn all the Albanian cities you can find numerous shops, which offer different goods, of well known marks, glasses, antique objects, etc. Of great interest for the tourists are the traditional bazaars of Kruja, Korca, Shkodër, Gjirokastra and Tirana, where you can find the artisan works produced by locals. You can buy wooden carved objects, ceramics, embroidery with popular motifs and also copper objects. Souvenirs: raki, alabaster bunker ashtrays.\n\n'''Always''' demand a receipt or ticket, especially at official tourist sites. It is a common scheme that they just reuse tickets or keep the money in their own pockets, as it happens in Butrint. This doesn't help conservation effort and supports money laundering.\n\n'''Online''' you can try [https://www.merrjep.al MerrJeb.al] for various used goods—Ebay or Facebook Market (or any Facebook Groups for that matter) do not seem to be very common or highly frequented.\n\n===Tipping===\nTipping has not become a custom in Albania and it is not expected; in some cases it might even confuse staff. If dining in a westernised restaurant in the capital you may round up the bill.\n\n===Repairs===\nIf you have a worn-down pair of shoes or have ripped any of your clothes, or even if your backpack is falling apart, such things can be repaired dirt-cheap in Albania for a few hundred lek. For example, fixing a hole in your shoes can be done for 200-300 lek. Help the environment, no need to buy new stuff!\n\n===Restaurants===\nNever ever dine in a restaurant without menu and/or prices: they are an invitations to scams. They do not have a menu for a reason, since they often come up with an outrageous bill for simple dishes. Don't give them any reason, stay away from them.\n\n==Eat==\n\nAlbania, like the Balkans in general, has a primarily Turkish influence in its cuisine. This influence stems from over 400 years of Ottoman rule in the region. Influences since the fall of communism in the early 1990s have been from Italy and Western Europe in general. Most of what is available in neighboring countries such as Greece and Italy will be available in Albania, particularly in the larger cities.\n\n===Main dishes===\n* '''Tasqebap''' – A traditional Albanian stew made of lamb fricassee, tomatoes and onions. Some sort of hearty '''stew''' is generally included in Albanian dinners. These stews are easy to make, and flexible with ingredients, like potatoes, onion, rice, etc.\n* '''Paçe Koke''' – A stew made from the head (''kokë'') of a lamb or a goat.\n* '''Paçe Plenci''' – Same as before, but made from intestines. However, the smell of cooking it can be off-putting.\n* '''Fërgesë''' – Baked cheese, vegetables and eggs; originating from the capital of Albania, Tirana.\n* '''Tavë dheu''' – ''Fërgesë'' with the addition of liver. Sometimes referred to as ''Fërgesë me melçi''.\n* '''(Mish) Tavë kosi''' – A baked dish of lamb and rice, together with a yogurt sauce. It is sometimes referred to as a national dish in Albania. Similarily, further such baked dishes exist; like ''Burani me Spinaq dhe Mish'' or just ''Mish Burani Spinaq'' with meat and spinach.\n* '''Pllaqi''' – Oven-baked beans with tomatoes sauce and herbs.\n* '''Mish me Bizele''' – Beans and meat.\n* '''Mish me Bamje''' – Ocra and meat, made in the late summer and fall when Ocra is harvested. Vegetarians can instead enjoy ''Bamje pa Mish''.\n* '''Byrek''' – Found everywhere, and made in different ways. ''Byrek Shqipëtar me perime'' (with spinach and feta cheese) is often considered the national dish. Another type sold everywhere is ''Byrek me mish'' (with ground meat and onions). Everywhere in the country one piece of pie costs around 30 lek, so in many places bakers don't even bother writing down the price. Two byreks and an ayran is a very common breakfast, so try it to understand why. This is also the reason why you should buy in the morning, when it is still freshly baked.\n* '''Qifqi''' – Served predominately around Gjirokastër, a vegetarian dish of fried rice balls.\n* '''Fli(ja)''' – A stack of layered hearty pancakes, brushed with cream and served together with sour cream. Also, a famous dish in Kosovo.\n* '''Shapkat''' – A traditional corn pie casserole originally from Gjirokastër, filled with feta cheese, dill, and spinach, but many variations exist.\n* '''Pastiche''' – Like a quiche, spaghetti cooked in milk, butter and white cheese.\n* '''Imam Bajalldi''' – Baked eggplants with a mix of vegetables and sometimes cheese ontop.\n* '''Japrak''' – Wrapped vine leaves with minced lamb, rice and herbs, cooked until tender. The vegetarian version (dolma) is also highly recommended.\n\nExpect lamb (''qengji''/''qingji'') to be the main '''meat (''mish'')''' in many places. Lamb is naturally fed, and does not have any Odor like it does in North America for example. However, also veal (''viçi'') and chicken (''pule'') meat is common. Various types of meat dishes exist:\n* '''Fileto''', '''biftek''' and '''bërxollë''' (chopped) are different ways to prepare the meat, besides '''zgare''' (grilled) or '''pjekur''' (baked).\n* '''Qofte''' – Meatballs, comes in different versions and is traditionally served as lunch or dinner together with salad, bread or rice. Sometimes they are declared to be homemade (''shtëpie'').\n* '''Qofte (të) fërguara''' – Fried meatballs but with feta cheese inside. Again, traditionally served with fried potatoes or rice.\n* '''Fileto Pule Me Panna Dhe Kerpudha''' – Grilled chicken breast served with mushrooms and cream sauce. Similar or even the same dish ''Pule me qull'', just written in short.\n* '''Paidhaqe Giçi''' – Pork Ribs\n* '''(Mikse) Mish Zgare''' – Literally (mixed) grill meat.\n* '''Kukurec''' – Strongly inspired by Turkey, grilled intestines and liver, sometimes served inside a bread like shawarma.\n* '''Të brendshme''' – More intestines\n* '''Mëlçi''' - Liver\n* '''(Pulë me) Përshesh''' – Originally from Elbasan, chicken with bread and walnuts. But you will barely find it on restaurant menues, it is mostly cooked at home.\n* '''(Pulë me) Rosnica''' – Similar to the one before, chicken boiled, onion and tomatoes added, and then baked together with small and fried dough or bread pieces. Also seldomly found in any restaurant.\n\n'''Sallatë''' (salad), usually made with fresh tomato and onion, but you have all different kinds of vegetable (''perime'') dishes:\n* '''Perime Zgare/Në Scarë''' – Grilled vegetables; eggplants, zucchini, peppers, onions, tomatoes, and/or mushrooms.\n* '''Perime të Ziera''' – Boiled vegetables\n* '''Perime Furre''' – Baked vegetables\n* '''Fshati''' – Village salad\n* '''Rukola''' – Rukola\n* '''Mikse''' – Mixed (salad)\n* '''Turshi''' – Pickles\n* '''Lakër''' – Cabbage\n* '''Karrotë''' – Carrot\n* '''Ullinj''' – Olives\n* '''Djathë i bardhë''' – White cheese\n* '''Djathë Kaçkavall''' – Hard cheese\n\nAs add-on to salads and meat:\n* '''Kos''' – Just yoghurt as an add-on to salads (baked), stews or meat.\n* '''Salce Kosi''' – Like the Greek tzatziki, best as a dip for grilled meat.\n\nMore:\n* '''Speca me gjizë''' / '''Speca me djathë''' – Peppers with (cottage) cheese as casserole\n* '''Speca te mbushura''' – Peppers stuffed with cheese\n* '''Djathë I Bardhë''' – Baked cheese\n\n* '''Tarator''' – A cold cucumber \"soup\" made with (lots of) yoghurt, cucumber and dill.\n\n* '''Supë''' (soup):\n:* ''Perime'' – Vegetables\n:* ''Krem pule'' – Chicken cream\n:* ''Pasha Qofte'' – Meatballs\n:* ''Krem Brokoli'' – Brokkoli cream\n:* ''(Jani me) Fasule'' – White bean soup, varying from clear to creamy, sometimes served with meat.\n\n* '''Fish and seafood''' – Can be found everywhere around the coast and lakes, but there are also many restaurants in Tirana serving such dishes. You will find all the usual, and '''Ohrid trout''' around the lakes.\n\n* '''Omletë (me Djathë dhe Proshutë)''' or '''Vezë syze''' – Omelets (with cheese and ham) or fried eggs\n\n=== Dairy products ===\n* '''Djathë i bardhë''' (young cheese) – There are lots of different types but mostly young cheese (white and soft feta-like). In village shops, cheese may be kept at a lower standard of hygiene than in supermarkets, but it's worth a try as it's usually fresh and delicious. Such cheese is sold for a very good price (600-800 lek/kg; try the higher-priced ones first), which in the rest of Europe can't be bought for less than €15/kg.\n:* ''djathë lope'' (cow cheese) – 400 lek/kg\n:* ''djathë dele'' (sheep cheese) – 800 lek/kg\n:* ''djathë dhie'' (goat cheese) – 700 lek/kg\n* The \"Gjirofarm\" feta cheese is similar to Greek feta cheese, although a bit more expensive. However, most of the restaurants, especially in Tirana and the southern part of the country, use this cheese. It's very delicious, and it's one of the few cheeses that is exported from Albania.\n* ''Kaçkavalli'' (hard cheese) – It's of good quality is not easy to find. It is advised to look for products imported from Italy.\n* ''Gjizë'' (cottage cheese) – A type of dry curded cheese, made from yogurt and citric acid (200 lek/kg).\n\n===Bread===\nMost Albanian people make their own bread, but going out for meals is very common. And bread is often served with meals, especially with salads, stews and soups.\n* '''Kulac''' – Firm and dense, also known as \"soda bread\"\n* '''Bukë''' – Buns\n\n===Desserts and snacks===\nDon't forget to check out the many pastry shops (pastiçeri) offering a wide variety of tasty pastry including delicious cakes. Find a shop that is frequented regularly, not seldomly the pastry lies around several days in some shops and is often dry and not delicious anymore.\n* '''Baklava''' – A popular dessert and is always made as a dessert during New Year's Eve.\n* '''Petulla''' – Often included in traditional home's breakfast, fried dough balls usually dipped in fig jam, honey, or feta.\n* '''Oshaf''' – A fig and sheep's milk pudding.\n* '''Qumështor''' – Baked custard\n* '''Hasude''' – Baked cornstarch pudding with nuts\n* '''Shëndetli''' – Nut cake with honey\n* '''Sultjash''' – A pudding of rice, milk, vanilla, cardamom and cinnamon.\n* '''Kabuni''' – Similarily to the previous dish, sweet fried rice with raisins, ground clover and cinnamon.\n* '''Ballokume Elbasani''' – A traditional biscuit originating from Elbasan and usually prepared on Dita e Verës, a pagan holiday. The roads along Elbasan are doted with sellers of this biscuit.\n\n=== Fruits and vegetables ===\nAlbania is a perfect place to try fresh local produce from local farmers. You get cheaper and higher-quality produce when buying in green-groceries or farmers on the street, so don't even bother buying greenery in the supermarket.\n\nSince Albania is a very mountainous country, these mountains have scattered olive trees that influence Albanian cuisine.\n\n* '''Grilled corn''' – In many cities you may find portable grills, where a freshly grilled corn is sold for 50 lek.\n\nVegetables and greens:\n* pepper (''piper'', ''spec'') – 70 lek/kg\n* tomato (''domatja'') – 50-100 lek/kg\n* okra or bamia (''bamje'') – 200-300 lek/kg \n* onion (''qepa'')\n* potato (''patatja'', ''patate'') – 45 lek/kg\n* aubergine (''patëllxhani'') – 70-100 lek/ kg\n* cabbage (''lakër'') – 30 lek/kg\n\nFruits:\n* figs – 200 lek/kg\n* pomegranates (''shegët'') – 100 lek/kg\n* watermelon (''shalqi'') – 15 lek/kg\n* melon (''pjepër'') – 80-100 lek/kg\n* grapes (''rrushi'') – 100-120 lek/kg\n* persimmon (''hurmë'') – 70 lek/kg\n\nSince many people grow fruits and vegetables around their houses, most popularly all kinds of grapes, (red, black, green), they use it to make ''Rakí'' from it.\n\n==Drink==\n \n\n===Raki===\nThe preferred alcoholic hard drink is ''rakí'', which is locally produced in small towns as well as in many homes in the countryside. In some instances you may see men washing down breakfast with a few shots.\n\nRaki is very common in Balkan countries, but also further apart in countries like Italy, Georgia and Turkey, while in Turkey the process is a little more complex and involves anis. Since each country got its specific fruit, raki is usually made from that fruit. In Georgia, raki (''chacha'') is won from the leftovers of the vine production, such as in Italy where it is called ''grappa''. In Bosnia, raki (''slivovitz'') is won overwhelmingly from barrels of plum. In Albania, different fruits are used, depending on the region, but ''rakí rushi'' (from grapes) is common. But you may try ''rakí mani'' (from mulberry), especially around Gjirokaster and Korça.\n\nAuthentic raki can be bought under the table from many shops and fruit and veggie markets. Served in 0.5L water bottles, for around 200-300 lek. They are safe, but tasting beforehand is accepted, and you should not buy it if it got a weird taste—this often means that the brewing process was not as clean as necessary. It doesn't mean though you will get blind, Albanians understand what they are doing, otherwise everyone would already be blind here. (Nevertheless, it doesn't hurt to prefer a shop which looks properly frequented by locals.)\n\n===Beer and wine===\nThe number of homemade beers and wines is as varied as the population itself; the quality of these drinks is as varied as the quantity available.\n\n===Tea===\nMountain tea (species: ''Sideritis scardica''), known under its local name '''çay mali''', is a very popular and tasty herbal tea in the Balkans and especially Albania. The dried flowers and stems can be bought in most local markets. It is often prepared with honey and lemon, even though the smell and taste itself is already rewarding enough, with no caffeine.\n\n===Non-alcoholic===\nNon-alcoholic drinks range from the well-known international and regional soft drink brands to the locally produced ones. You can find any type of soft drink in Albania, as well as natural mineral water, energy drinks, etc. Qafshtama water is considered the best water and found in much of the country.\n\n* '''Boza''' – A popular sweet drink made from maize (corn) and wheat is a traditional drink in the Balkans. The most famous of which is \n* '''Dhallë''' – A kefir-like drink closely related to ''ayran''\n* '''Kos''' – A yogurt-like drink very similar to Georgian_cuisine#Dairy_products|matsoni in the Caucasus (100-160 lek/L)\n\n\n==Sleep==\n\nInside the cities, hotels are abundant and prices per night start as low as €15. Hotels are usually clean and their staff in major cities generally speak English and/or Italian.\n\nOutside the big cities, hotels are less common, but in places like Gjirokastra can be excellent value (e.g., 1000 lek). If, for any reason, you find nowhere to sleep, the Albanian people have always been known for their hospitality, and will treat you like royalty as you stay with them.\n\n== Learn ==\nTwo of the most prestigious universities in the country are '''[https://upt.edu.al/ Polytechnic University of Tirana]''' and '''[https://unitir.edu.al/ University of Tirana]'''.\n\n== Work ==\nDespite significant foreign investment, finding employment in Albania can be difficult; the country has one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe and wages are relatively low. In addition, corruption, a weak judicial system, and frequent legislative changes complicate matters further. \n\nAlbania is a relationship-based society that puts an emphasis on friendship, hospitality, and trust. When meeting your Albanian business counterparts, it is advised that you inquire about their health, family, and general well-being.\n\n==Stay safe==\n\nAlbania is generally a safe place to visit but there are some safety precautions you have to take before visiting the country.\n* In some Albanian cities like Berat there are no traffic lights and thus crossing on the road can be dangerous\n* Avoid places that are deemed as slums and are sketchy, things like pickpocket can happen and also violence can occur, so avoid bringing valuables in those areas.\n* Albania does have speed limits, but most people do not follow them. If you are driving on the highway, you have to pay extra attention to avoid car crashes . If you are not a good driver it is highly recommended that you take a bus.\n\n===Stray dogs===\nAlbania is one of the countries where stray dogs can be a problem. This can be of particular concern when you go out hiking in remote areas, where dogs not always stick to their territory or you even have to walk through their territory.\n\nIn addition to stray dogs in the cities (especially in Shkoder), in rural areas many places and farms have dogs, but they generally do not tend to leave their premises. This can still happen and they might block your way. In either case, if you feel a dog is getting too close for any reason, even if it looks harmless, pick up one or two stones; most dogs will understand the gesture, back down and disappear into the distance. If this does not help and a dog is running towards you aggressively barking, use the stones for your defence.\n\nSee the Aggressive dogs article for more help regarding this topic.\n\n==Stay healthy==\n\nIt's best to drink '''bottled water''', but tap water is usually drinkable too. In summer, insect repellent should be used as mosquitos are very active especially near former swamps and along the Western lowland. Be careful at the beaches because shards of glass and sea urchins are common on the sea floor. Also, pharmacies and other stores are closed from about 12:00-16:00; so, bring all necessary medicine with you. Health clinics in small towns or village areas are not well equipped, so trips to nearby cities can be expected. Also, many Albanians smoke cigarettes. The government has banned smoking in restaurants but this is not really observed.\n\n==Respect==\n\nAlbanians are very hospitable. Even more so than the rest of the Balkans, elder males expect to be shown respect on account of their age. Men of the family have to be respected in particular. Shake hands with them and do not argue about topics such as religion and politics. Certain topics are strictly taboo; homosexuality is one good example. Don't speak about gay rights, no matter what. The situation changes a lot according to the location (village or city) and the people with whom you speak as well. Of course, in the hidden north, avoid topics that go beyond local understanding, but be sure that in Tirana you will find very cosmopolitan people that are as open to new ideas as the citizens of Western Europe.\n\nSometimes, if you stay for a night or so at someone's house, don't be surprised if you see a AK-47 Kalashnikov hanging at the wall. It's pretty normal for Albanians to keep guns in the house.\n\nAlbania is mostly a secular country, although most of the population consider themselves Muslim (the majority) or Christian. Ramadan does not close down street life, at least in Tirana, but you may still not want to break Islamic taboos without checking that it is OK in your current company.\n\n===Traditions===\nIn Albania it's common for men to kiss cheeks of males of their age or younger, even the first time they meet them. This is especially true for the regions of Fier, Tepelena, Vlora and Gjirokastra. In Northern Albania, they will simply touch each other's cheeks, but not kiss them. Women also kiss one another, sometimes from the first time they meet, but men and women do not kiss each other on the cheek unless they have been friends for a long time. Kissing cheeks between young people, 15–20 years old, is however very common. If you are a man, or a woman with a group of men, don't compliment females, unless they are under 10–12 years.\n\nIf a baby is in the family, always ask to see him or her, and don't forget to add a compliment (usually \"Genka i shendetshem, me jete te gjate\" or \"What a sweet baby\" works best).\n\nIf you speak a language where there are different formal and informal words for \"you\" in singular and \"you\" (like Italian, Greek, German, etc.), be aware that some Albanians do not use the formal form in their language. Sometimes, even the prime minister is addressed with \"ti\" (the informal word for \"you\", \"tu\" in Italian, \"Du\" in German or \"Esi\" in Greek), if the journalist is a friend of him. However, when meeting people for the first time, it's better if you address them with the formal word, although they will shortly after ask you to address them with the informal one.\n\nPolicemen in Albania are often polite. They usually never stop foreign cars, but if you rent a car, they may stop you. However, when they see you are a foreign tourist, they will immediately tell you to go on (usually with a \"Ec, ec, rruge te mbare\" which can be translated in \"Go on. Have a nice trip\"). When this happens, it's very polite if you respond with a \"Faleminderit\" (\"thank you\" in Albanian).\n\nAlbanians love dancing, especially during weddings. If you are attending a party, don't be afraid to dance. Maybe you don't know the traditional dances, but try to learn.\n\n==Cope==\n\n===Electricity===\n\nOfficially 220 V 50&amp;nbsp;Hz. Outlets are the European standard CEE-7/7 or the compatible, but non-grounded, CEE-7/16 \"Europlug\" types. Generally speaking, U.S. and Canadian visitors should pack an adapter for these outlets if they plan to use North American electrical equipment in Albania.\n\nUnexpected power outages without prior warnings are common in Albania. This is largely dependent on the amount of rainfall the country receives in any given year, as virtually all of electricity is generated from hydro plants in Albania. However this is becoming more and more rare. In Tirana power outages are rare, but expect them in other towns and cities. Although all major cities and most of the towns have back-up generators, however it is best to err on the side of the caution and ask whether the place has a generator or not beforehand in order not to, say, get stuck in an elevator.\n\n==Connect==\n===Mobile===\nAs of Sept 2021, Vodafone has the best coverage, with 4G in Tirana, the other main towns, and highways between. One and ALB have 4G in Tirana but less coverage elsewhere. 5G has not rolled out in Albania.\n\nGenerally, Vodafone or One will be the first choice for travellers. You can buy a local prepaid SIM card from 800 lek including some MB of data—you will always have to buy a package initially with the SIM card. After that there are offers of 35 GB for 2,000 lek, or 6 GB for 600 lek (per month).\n\n'''Note''' that Vodafone and One have special deals where when you install their app, you get an additional 10 GB for 1 month, or when you charge money onto your account, you get extra GB, like 3 GB for one month for a recharge of 600 lek with One. Also, it makes sense to drop by in one of their shops and ask for any specials they offer—they often have packages in-store which cannot be selected through their app but have a better price-value ratio, e.g. 32 GB for 1,000 lek with Vodafone. Hence, you don't really need an expensive package from the app every month, like mentioned before.\n\nYou need to provide a passport to purchase a prepaid SIM.\n\nMany mobile providers in the Balkans provide '''free roaming across Balkan''' countries. So, in case you are planning to cross the border, ask on how to use the local SIM card in other Balkan countries. For instance, a One.al SIM card from Albania works flawlessly in North Macedonia and Kosovo with a regular Albanian package.\n\n===Internet===\nMany bars and restaurant have WiFi readily available, just ask.\n\nBesides that, Digicom (a DSL provider) uses the same default password for all their routers, which is \"20202020\". So, whenever you see a WiFi named \"Digicom.al 2.4GHz\" or \"Digicom.al 5GHz\" just try this passphrase. Also, many places, guesthouses or restaurants seem to use the easy to remember \"12345678\" passphrase.\n\n==Go next==\n\nYou can go from Shkoder in northern Albania to Ulcinj in '''Montenegro''' by taxi or vans. Fares can be negotiated between €15 and €20, it takes between 1 and 2&amp;nbsp;hours. There are [https://getbybus.com/en/ buses] leaving from Shkoder to other places in Montenegro (Podgorica, Budva and Kotor), departing at 10:00 or 13:20 From Ulcinj you can also take busses to other cities in Montenegro.\n\nCrossing into '''North Macedonia''' at the border between Pogradec and Ohrid, North Macedonia is fairly straightforward. From Pogradec, one can take a taxi to the border - this will likely cost around €5 and take around 10&amp;nbsp;minutes. Once you get to the border, it is possible to walk into North Macedonia, but do not expect to find taxis on the other side of the border. Instead, hire a taxi on the Albanian side (€25, 40&amp;nbsp;minutes to Ohrid) or wait for the minibus that turns around at the border. This bus comes every few hours and is the same bus that services the Sveti Naum Monastery, which lies a few kilometers from the border. If the bus does not show up, your best option would be to head to monastery's parking lot a few kilometers distant to find the bus (check Google Earth first to get a fix on its location).\n\nYou can go to '''Kosovo''' from Kukes on the new highway.\n\nYou can go to '''Greece''' by Gjirokaster at the border crossing at Kavavi.\n\nBy boat, you can leave for '''Italy''' from Durres or Vlorë. From Saranda you can go to Corfu, Greece.\n\n\n\n\n"

The mountains themselves extend into neighboring Kosovo and Montenegro.\n\n==Towns and villages==\nThe main city of the area is '''Bajram Curri'''.\n\n'''Shkoder''' is in the coastal plain just west of the region.\n\nThe villages of '''Thethi''', '''Valbonë''' and '''Kelmend''' are the main tourist destinations.\n\n== Parks ==\nThe areas around Thethi and Valbona constitute two separate Albanian National Parks: the Thethi National Park and Valbona Valley National Park respectively.\n\nThe greater region along the border of Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo is where the Balkan Peace Park may one day exist.\n\n== Mountains ==\nProkletije is the area where the highest mountains of Albania are.\n\n==Understand==\nThe area has been extensively visited by Edith Durham who wrote an entire book about the region and its customs.\n\n====Visitor information kiosks====\n\n* \n* \n\n==Get in==\n===Theth===\n\nTo get to Bogë leave Shkodra in direction of Montenegro on the brand new highway and turn off at the signposted exit at a roundabout near the city of Koplik, the road onwards is narrow but paved to the center of . The pass (Qafa e Thorës 1685m) behind Bogë is closed by snow during the winter, often as early as November and well into May. Also at the beginning and end of the season the road is in a rough condition.\n\nIt's generally not advisable to undertake this journey on your own without a high clearance vehicle, in bad weather conditions 4wd can be handy. During summer there are various vehicles continuing to Theth and it's possible to hitch a ride. Public transport leaves from Shkodra in the morning, during the main season several minibuses a day, the trip takes around 3 hr.\n\nAlso several hiking trails allow to arrive in Theth on foot, look at wikiloc.org for more details under the search term \"Thores\".\n\nAnother way to reach Theth by road is via Kiri Valley. You leave Shkodra in direction of the Mesi Bridge following the asphalt road until you reach the village Prekal, from here one continues on a rough unpaved route through the Kiri Valley, crosses the pass (Qafa e Mali i Shoshit on above 1200m and reaches . Once you get to the bottom of the valley you arrived in Bregu i Lumit (the administrative center of Shala region), daily minibuses service the route from here to Shkodra. It's a short drive from here to Nderlysa and Theth.\n\n===Valbonë===\n\nTo get to the beautiful Valbonë valley you need to get first to Bajram Curri. To get there take breathtaking trip across Lake Koman on a ferry or drive to Gjakova (Kosovo) and cross back into Albania at Qafa e Morines. From Bajram Curri get on a minibus to Valbonë.\n\n===Kelmend===\n\nTo reach Kelmend you leave Shkodra by following the highway North to the border crossing with Montenegro, called Hani i Hotit. After passing under the railway bridge turn off right and head for the village of Rapsh. A spectacular viewpoint into the Cemi Canyon awaits you on top of the plateau from where you descend on a newly paved road that snakes down to the bottom of the canyon. The first village you arrive at is Tamare, the local center with tourist info, restaurant, shops and hospital. At the entrance is the turn-off for Nikc and Vukel from where you start hiking to Theth.\n\nPast Tamara lie Selca, Lepushe and Vermosh, the real highlights of the region. Many trails are marked, there is a free map and plenty of guesthouses to stay at. From Vermosh crossroads, the final stretch of the road lead to a border crossing with Montenegro near Gusinje (entire length of the road from Hani i Hotit to Gusinje is now paved, except a final 500-m stretch just before the border post on Albanian side).\n\n==Get around==\nGetting around is best with your own vehicle, or if you have more time, your own bicycle, or on foot. There is little public transportation, and on many routes this means just one minibus early in the morning.\n\nThe mountain pass which separates Thethi from Rrogami is only passable on foot. It is a challenging hike over a poorly marked trail. Parts of the trail are a bit sparse.  The best way to find your way over that pass (Qafe e Valbonës) is with a local guide.  The trail begins at the very end of the village of Rrogam.  The trail is rather light, and seems to disappear at some points.  If you are on a tight schedule, a guide is recommended.  There are some English and Italian speaking residents in this area, but it is really best to speak Albanian.  If walking on foot does not sound appealing, a horse or donkey can likely be arranged with one of the villagers for an appropriate fee (5,000 lek).  If you have time to spare, the trail can be found through a bit of detective work (following donkey dung, etc.) and with enough time, you too can practice the art of trailblazing.a\n\n=== Topographic maps ===\n\nAlbanian topographic maps are hard to find.  Topographic maps in scales 1:25,000, 1:50,000 or smaller are published by Institutin Topografik të Ushtrisë (ITU) and for sale from [https://shop.geospatial.com/product/01-ALAB-Albania-25000-Topographic-Maps East View Geospatial], [https://www.omnimap.com/catalog/int/albania.htm omnimap], or [https://www.chartsandmaps.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=3_18 chartsandmaps.com].  Soviet maps from the 1950s can be downloaded from [https://mapstor.com/map-sets/country-maps/albania.html mapstor] for $1 per sheet (with discounts for bulk orders).  Border areas (including this area) were also mapped by the US army [https://www.nga.mil/history/1604011696989_National_Imagery_and_Mapping_Agency.html National Imagery and Mapping Agency] in the 1990s and archived by the [http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/topo/former_yugoslavia/ University of Texas] or for sale by [https://shop.geospatial.com/product/01-YUAU-Former-Yugoslavia-M709-Series-50-000-Scale-Topographic-Maps East View Geospatial].  Similar border areas are also covered on Yugoslav maps available from [https://mapstor.com/map-sets/country-maps/albania.html#mne--025k--(1980-1980)--preview mapstor] (scale 1:25,000).  Some trails are also drawn on OpenStreetMap, in particular the more popular ones.\n\n===Itineraries===\nA good itinerary would include the Fierzë-Komani ferry on lake Komani. You could get from Shkoder to Bajram Curri by way of this ferry, then visit the Valbonë valley, and either (for experienced and well-equipped hikers) get over the mountain pass to Thethi (asphalted road starts from Boge downwards to Koplik as of 2010), and go back to Shkoder from there (this loop would probably take an absolute minimum of 4 days, and a more likely duration of 6 or 7 days), or from the Valbonë Valley get back to Bajram Curri and continue east towards Tropoja or Kosovo.\n\nAn emerging destination is Razëm|Razëm village. Follow the Shkodër-Koplik road, turn to the right on Rr. e Komisariatit and then turn left for Razëm at Dedaj. The road is in good condition (2011). The first of the only two alpine resorts in the Albanian Alps in Albania is located here, equipped from saunas and indoor swimming pools to ski courses!\n\n==See==\n\nStunning scenery and grand vistas, a unique and difficult way of life, and traditional Albanian houses and villagers.\n* '''Lock-in tower''' (Thethi) has been restored.  The lock-in tower is especially of interest because it is one of the last remaining examples in Albania.  The lock in tower was used to protect the male members of a family while they were under blood feud.  Blood feuds were virtually extinguished during the communist times, however, the lawlessness of the 1990s saw a rather sharp rise in the number of killings.  :''The New York Times'' has a series of articles about the Kanun, Lekë Dukagjini, and the blood feuds.  Tourists and foreigners are generally immune from these (and even protected, unless you flip over someone's table!).\n* '''Grunas Waterfall''' in Valbone and spectacular Valbona River\n* \n\n==Do==\nHike those amazing mountains! The very little traffic in those remote areas makes it nice to hike even on the roads. Go fishing in the Valbonë river. The rapids near Dragobia seem to be a popular place.  If you can, talk to people. In the summer, visit one of the hundreds of caves of Razem village.\n\n==Eat==\n\nTry buying local foods from people in villages (this may be tricky without speaking Albanian!) You might get locally made cheese such as Kelmend-based Mishavin, Velecik, delicious home-baked bread, pickles, wild pomegranates, cranberries, blueberries, grape jam and various composts, natural honey, chestnuts, mountain tea, local plums, apples, and Kallmet Wine.\n\nTry mazë, a dish made from butter, corn flour and sheep cheese. Taste roasted ram known as fërlik, wild bird based dishes, and freshly baked trout. Locals also bake wild animals such as boars, goats, and rabbits.\n\nThe restaurant of the hotel \"Margjeka\" (located up in the valley about 500&amp;nbsp;m before the minibuses end) serves huge portions of self-slaughtered meat.\n\nSome of the area's specialties are being internationally recognized for being locally grown by the Slow Food Foundation [http://www.slowfoodfoundation.com/ark]\n\n# '''Flija''': This layered pancake dish is particularly popular in mountainous areas. It's made by pouring thin layers of batter onto a heated stone or metal surface and stacking them one on top of the other as they cook.\n# '''Pite me Mish''': A type of savory pie filled with meat, vegetables, and herbs, often cooked in a wood-fired oven for added flavor.\n# '''Grilled Meat''': Grilling is a common cooking method in the mountains, and you'll often find skewers of marinated meat cooking over open flames. Lamb, goat, and pork are popular choices.\n# '''Kerpudha te Mbushura''': Stuffed mushrooms are a delicious appetizer or side dish made by filling mushroom caps with a mixture of cheese, herbs, and breadcrumbs, then baking them until golden brown.\n# '''Mish i Zgare''': Grilled meat dishes are prevalent in mountainous regions, often seasoned simply with salt, pepper, and herbs, and cooked over an open flame for a smoky flavor.\n# '''Mountain Herbs and Greens''': Wild herbs and greens are often foraged in the mountains and used in cooking. These might include mountain thyme, wild mint, dandelion greens, and more, adding unique flavors to dishes.\n# '''Pickled Vegetables''': Pickling is a traditional method of preserving vegetables, and pickled vegetables such as cucumbers, peppers, and cabbage are often served as a side dish or appetizer.\n# '''Traditional Dairy Products''': Mountainous regions are known for their dairy products, including cheeses like feta and kajmak, as well as yogurt and buttermilk, which are often served alongside meals or used in cooking.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the delicious dishes you might encounter while dining in the mountains of Albania. The cuisine is hearty, flavorful, and often incorporates fresh, locally sourced ingredients.\n\n==Drink==\nTurkish coffee, home-made raki (plum alcohol), and locally made wine.\n\n==Sleep==\nApart from the hotels in nearby cities like Bajram Curri and Shkodra|Shkoder, there are a number of traditional village guesthouses that are becoming increasingly popular with international tourists. It is easy to find people willing to accommodate you or let you camp in their garden.  Among those who speak English or Italian and are accustomed to foreign tourists, a price of around €20 is common, and includes breakfast and dinner. Sometimes locals don't mention paying until you are leaving in the morning, which is not the best moment to bargain the price. So be sure you make everything clear when you arrive.\n\nIn addition to homestays, there are also a number of hostels and guesthouses in the villages of Albanian Alps.\n\n* \n\n==Connect==\nThere is cellular phone coverage in the Thethi area but not in Valbone. In the latter mobile devices must be hanged onto a tree to receive signal! (2011)\n\n==Stay safe==\nDon't get lost in the mountains. This is a sparsely-inhabited area and the trails are not marked and signage is sparse. A GPS is highly recommended, and a simple base map is available through the [http://www.bunkertrails.org/ Bunker Trails] project.\n\nSupposedly, there are bear and wolves in the area, so rough camping is not recommended for the timid. If you do decide to camp, be sure to employ proper bear bag techniques or bears might follow the scent of that dry sausage hidden under your pillow.\n\nThis area has witnessed disturbing violent conflict due to extreme poverty and isolation. While Albania as a whole was virtually sealed until 1991, this area was isolated to an even greater extend because of the condition of access roads.\n\nFollowing the chaos of 1997, it took the Albanian police many years to regain control of the entire country, and it is known to be one of the strongholds of resistance to law and order.\n\nThe main tourist attractions are safe to visit, but ask locals which areas to avoid.\n\n==Go next==\n*Puka- Another beautiful destination in Albania, known for its natural landscapes and outdoor activities.\nExplore the stunning natural beauty of Puka through hiking trails that lead to scenic spots like the Puka Plateau and the surrounding mountains. The area is known for its lush forests,rivers,and pristine landscapes.\nDiscover the rich cultural heritage of Puka by  visiting historical sites such as churches,mosques,and traditional villages. Don't miss the chance to interact with locals and learn about their traditions and way of life.\n\n\n\n* Shkodra\n* Tropojë \n\n\n"

                    "text": "\n'''Albanian''' (''shqip'') is the national and official language of Albania. It is an Indo-European language, forming its own isolated branch within the Indo-European language family. Thus it is not related closely to any other Indo-European language. It is an official language of Kosovo and spoken by the majority of the population as a native tongue. Albanian also enjoys co-official status in North Macedonia. The Albanian-speaking area spans across the Republic of Albania, the Preševo Valley of Serbia, and most of Kosovo, southern Montenegro, and a part of western North Macedonia. \n\nAlbanian has two main dialects, '''Gheg''' and '''Tosk''', or the northern and southern dialects. The official standard is based on the Tosk dialect since the 1940s (both in Albania and in Kosovo, though the latter completely falls within the borders of the northern dialect), which is reported to be a \"softer\" version of the language by native speakers. While the two dialects are mutually intelligible, a number of differences between each other exists.\n\n==Pronunciation guide==\n\nAlbanian is written as it is pronounced. The Albanian alphabet consists of 36 letters of the Latin script. The alphabet was standardised in 1909. Albanian is a branch of Indo-European and is considered to be the only language derived from the extinct Illyrian language. \n\n===Stress===\n\nFor the vast majority of words, the main '''stress''' falls on the last word of a phrase, on the last stem of a compound word, and on the last syllable of a word. \n\n===Vowels===\n\n; Аа : \t'a' as in \"far\" \n; Ee :\t'e' as in \"elephant\"\n; Ii :\t'ee' as in \"feet\"\n; Oo :  'o' as in \"obey\"\n; Uu :\t'oo' as in \"moon\"\n; Ëë :\t'a' in \"above\" (it is silent at times at the end of a word)\n; Yy :\t'y' as the French 'u' or the German 'ü'. To pronounce the sound, place your mouth in the position you would when you say 'oo' as in \"moon\", but say 'ee' as in \"feet\" instead. The closest sound in British English as is 'ue' in \"blue\" or 'ew' as in \"flew\".\n\n===Consonants===\n\n; Bb : \n; Cc : \n; Çç : \n; Dd : \n; Dhdh : \n; Ff : \n; Gg : \n; Gjgj : , in some dialects \n; Hh : \n; Jj : \n; Kk : \n; Ll : \n; Llll : \n; Mm : \n; Nn : \n; Njnj : \n; Pp : \n; Qq : , in some dialects \n; Rr : \n; Rrrr : \n; Ss : \n; Shsh : \n; Tt : \n; Thth : \n; Vv : \n; Xx : \n; Xhxh : \n; Zz : \n; Zhzh : \n\n===Common diphthongs===\n\n; io : 'io' as in \"million\"\n; ua : 'ua' as in 'iguana'\n\n===Other Sounds===\n\n; oj : 'oy' as in \"boy\"\n; aj : 'i' as in \"night\"\n; ej : 'ay' as in \"play\"\n \n; the : [tyeh] like the Spanish word 'tie' in \"tiesto\"\n; nje : [nyeh] like the Spanish word 'ñe' in \"muñeco\"\n; nju : [nyoo] like the English word \"new\"\n; njo : [nyoh] like the Spanish word \"moño\"\n; aja : [ayah]/[aia] like the Italian word 'aia' in \"baia\"\n; vje : [vyeh] like the Spanish word 'vie' in \"viejo\"\n; lje : [lyeh] like the Italian word \"moglie\"\n; dja : [dyah] like the Spanish word \"día\"\n; rja : [ryah] like the 'ria' in \"Maria\"\n\n==Phrase list==\n\n===Basics===\n\n\n\n; Hello. :Tungjatjeta.

                    "text": "\n\nThe '''Albanian Riviera''' (Albanian: ''Bregu'') lies along the southwestern Coastal Albania|coast of Albania, from the village of Palasë and ending in Lukovë.\n\n==Cities and towns==\n\n\n is the only city, but there are a lot of small, picturesque villages mostly located on the overlooking mountain passes:\n\n* Palasë\n* \n* Ilias\n* \n* Potam\n* Llaman\n* Jal\n* Bunec\n* \n* Qeparo\n* Pilur\n* Spille\n* Sasaj\n* Piqeras\n* Nivice\n* Shen Vasil\n\nEach of the towns have several excellent beach areas.\n\n==Other destinations==\n*  &amp;mdash; archaeological site and national park\n* '''Gjipe Canyon''' &amp;mdash; at the start of Karaburun Peninsula near Palase is a coastal canyon ending into the sea.\n*  &amp;mdash; south of Sarandë\n*  &amp;mdash; located amid rich fauna in the area of Llogara Pass can be used for hiking and as an alpine retreat. Some small resorts are located here. The 1020&amp;nbsp;hectare area is covered by lush plant life and considered a classic place where a natural equilibrium exists between the world of animals and plants. Don't forget to visit the Flag Pines resembling the Albanian Eagle.  Mineral dolomite can be found in a place called \"Gerxhina Mountain\".\n* '''Llogara Pass''' &amp;mdash; is a picturesque mountain pass overlooking the Albanian Riviera. It serves as a panoramic venue to exploring the Riviera from above and touching the clouds at the same time. Pine trees cover the land, but there are many box-wood trees as well. Don't forget to visit Caesar's Pass, a place named after Julius Caesar who passed in this area while in pursuit of Pompey. The area of Llogara has a height of 1027&amp;nbsp;meters. Here one can almost fly into the sky and walk over the sea!\n*  &amp;mdash; at the Corfu Strait\n*  &amp;mdash; region including '''Karaburun-Sazan National Marine Park''' along the waters of adjacent Karaburun Peninsula and Sazan Island. In 2014, the Regina Blu ferry was established by a Radhime-based hotel owner making trips to the national marine park and stopping along the secluded beaches.[http://hotelregina.al/en/guide]\n\n==Understand==\n\n==Talk==\n\nMost of the villagers of this region are bilingual and speak both Albanian and Greek. In village of Palasa, Greek is spoken as a mother language. The natives also speak Italian very well. A lot of young people speak English, but old ones don't. However, since the beaches are full of educated people from Tirana, just ask help from them (search for young people) and they are very willing to help you understand the steward or someone else, that doesn't speak your language.\n\n==Get in==\n===By car===\nThe best way to quickly get to the Riviera and thoroughly explore it is by car.\n\nFrom Tirana, enter the SH2 highway to Durrës, turn into SH85 Durres Bypass at Shkozet or enter in the city proper through Rruga Pavaresia/SH4. Continue down south onto SH4 by passing several towns like Kavaje, Rrogozhine and Lushnje. Some portions of the SH4 are being widened to double carriageway standards (as of 2011). Keep a close eye on slow moving vehicles, pedestrians, undisciplined drivers, and road signs. At Fier, exit the highway to enter the city center as the Fier Bypass in under construction (as of 2014). Enter the new A2 Highway at Levan linking Fier with Vlore. After exiting Vlore, continue onto the main SH8 road passing Orikum and Llogara Pass. The latter can be quite dangerous as the road is narrow at spots, high elevation means constant braking or frequent gear changes, tight turns and lack of barriers at some places. The typical Mediterranean coastal road that follows will prove very satisfying. However, don't be surprised to see old aged ladies dressed in black and carrying heavy loads of wood for the winter, people riding on donkeys, shepherds walking undisturbed with their flocks of sheep, or just cows chilling for the sake of it - all along the main road!\n\n===By train===\nNo international train connections exist in Albania. The railway's southern most and closest train station to the riviera is at Vlore.\n===By bus===\nFrom Tirana there are buses that take you in almost all sourthern cities. Also from Elbasan is a , including buses to Greece.\n\n===By boat===\nFrom Corfu with the daily ferry to Saranda, or from the big port of Vlora.\n===By yacht===\nYachts can be anchored at Albania's only marina in Orikum, south of Vlore. Contact [http://www.orikum.it Orikum Marina].\n\n===By plane===\nYou could fly to Corfu, and then take the daily ferry to Saranda. Otherwise, fly to Tirana International Airport.\n\n==Get around==\nMany prefer to tour around with camper vans, rented cars or simply by foot. Most of the roads going down to the beaches have been paved. Others cycle through the winding coastal road. Most religious sites are located in strategic locations uphill from villages or beaches.\n\n==See==\n* '''Castle of Porto-Palermo''' or '''Ali Pasha Tepelena Castle''' south of Himara in Porto Palermo. This castle was designed by a French engineer and was constructed in the shape of a pentagon with stone blocks width up to 1.6&amp;nbsp;meters.\n* '''Castle of Sopoti/Borshi''' including '''Borshi Mosque''' and '''Old Qeparo'''\n* '''Churches of Shen Stefani and Shen Dhimitri''' in the village of Dhermi (XII–XIV centuries)\n* Islands of '''Ereikoussa''' and '''Othonoi''' and a portion of Northern Corfu can be seen with the naked eye\n* '''Kakome Fortified Monastery''' in a hill overlooking picturesque Kakome Bay\n* '''Kroreze Monastery''' in Nivice with a bell dedicated by the King of Naples to the Lukove natives that fell for the Queen of Naples.\n* '''Ruins of Himarë|Himara Castle''' in Himarë|Himare. Emperor Justinian had the castle rebuilt to defend against the attack of the Barbars, Gots and the Hus. It was fortified by the Kaon tribe and is mentioned in Byzantine documents. It was repaired in the 6th century.\n* '''Shen e Premte Church''' in Lukove\n* '''Shen Gjergji Monastery''' and '''Nivice Basilica''' in Nivice\n* '''Shen Thanasi Church''' in downtown Piqeras and '''Shen Maria Kernesoves Church''' in uptown with a 1744 dated bell dedicated to some 30 natives who left the village to build a new one in Italy.\n* '''Shen Vasili Monastery''' in a hill above Shen Vasili village and '''Kronjezes Virgin Church''' remnants\n\n==Do==\nGenerally, one should immerse in the turquoise waters, visit the numerous churches and fortresses, venture in the flower decorated footpaths of the uphill villages by meeting the hospitable elderly inhabitants, try local organic specialties, and ultimately enjoy the surrounding mountains and overall natural beauty of this coastal stretch.\n\n* '''Hike''' and take part in paragliding activities in Llogara National Park and visit the '''cave''' located in the area.\n* '''Camp''' alongside the beach or among the olive trees in the dozen campsites of Dhermi, Jal, and others throughout the coast.\n* '''Dive''' or take a sailing tour on the waters of the Riviera and of Karaburun-Sazan National Marine Park along the adjacent Karaburun Peninsula just north of Palase. Discover the rich '''sea life''' and ruins of ancient and recent '''sunk ships'''. Explore the marble walls and cold war artifacts of the peninsula and hike the rugged terrain of '''Karaburun Peninsula''' and visit the numerous caves of the region. Be aware that the park is located nearby military zones.\n* Take part in the growing lineup of '''music festivals''' such as Soundwave Albania featuring electronic music and Turtle Fest. You can party up your stay by visiting some of the many trendy '''beach bars'''.\n* Immerse in the many turquoise beaches named after the villages overlooking the coast from the picturesque mountains. The region is a perfect combination of mountain and coastal climate.  Following are villages and beaches in order from north to south:\n* '''Palasa''' is located at the beginning of the Riviera, just below Llogara Pass. In this 1&amp;nbsp;km long unspoiled beach Julius Caesar in a moment of rage is said to have thrown his wine cup into the sea. It is said that he set foot and rested his legion at Palase while in pursuit of Pompey. You could try finding it!\n* '''Dhërmi Beach''' is considered a nightlife destination for the Albanian youth where a number of small wooden villa complexes and trendy beach clubs are located.\n* '''Jal''' village incorporates four beach areas equipped with few local B&amp;B and government owned enmities. Visit the two secluded beaches in the south, one of which is named Akuariumi (the Aquarium). Kampingu Jal, the oldest camp site in Albania is located in [https://www.facebook.com/jal.kamp/ Jal Beach]. Folie Marine is one of the trendiest beach clubs in the Riviera located near Soleil Village Resort.[http://www.soleilvillage.com]\n* '''Filikuri Beach''' is a 100&amp;nbsp;meter long beach easily reachable by boat with a rich underwater fauna.\n* '''Llamani Beach''' is located between two rocky coastal sides and is 200&amp;nbsp;meters long. It contains cold water areas stemming from the many underground water sources.\n* '''Porto Palermo Beach''' is the most panoramic beach of the Riviera.

Albany is the longest continually chartered city in the United States, the original eastern terminus of the Erie Canal, and was a center for the smuggling of alcohol from Canada during the U.S. Prohibition. \n\nWriter and journalist William Kennedy, an Albany native, uses the city and its history as the setting for most of his novels, plays and nonfiction books.\n\n===Tourist information ===\n* [https://www.albany.org/ Explore Albany] website\n\n==Get in==\n===By plane===\n*  | url=http://www.albanyairport.com | email=\n| address=737 Albany Shaker Rd | lat=42.748588 | long=-73.805598 | directions=\n| phone=+1 518-242-2200 | tollfree= | fax=\n| hours= | price=\n| image=Albany International Airport.jpg | wikidata=Q1430745\n| content=Classified as an international airport due to a handful of flights from Canada.

Nicknamed the \"Hub of the Valley\", it is 69 miles (111 km) south of Portland (Oregon)|Portland and 44 miles (71 km) north of Eugene. The town sits at the confluence of the Willamette River and Calapooia River. Albany's streets are lined with historic homes and a carousel museum. Its location in the Willamette Valley, known for its wine, allows the town to offer locally made wine, as well as cider and beer.\n\n==Understand==\n\nHistorically, Albany was populated by the Kalapuya people. Albany was called ''Takenah'' by the Kalapuya, which describes a deep pool at the confluence of the Calapoola and Willamette rivers. The population, which totaled upwards of 20,000 before European contact, suffered the effects of smallpox brought by the Europeans in 1782-83. Additional damage was done to the community by malaria, which arrived in the area between 1830-33. The majority of the populations of the Kalapuya was killed in the epidemics. By the 1850s, treaties opened the door for Europeans to have complete control of the land that would become Albany.\n\nAbner Hackleman was the first European to settle in the area, in 1845. Eventually, more Europeans came to the area via the Oregon Trail, including the Monteith Brothers. These two families, the Monteith and Hackleman's would develop two opposing communities in the area. For example, the Hackleman's identified as Democrats, when the Monteith's were Republicans. The community came at odds during the American Civil War, with the Hacklemans supporting the Confederacy and the Monteiths, the Union. Historic homes today represent the memory of these families. Albany is split into two sides, East and West, represented by the legacy of these families. The Monteiths are identified as the founding family of Albany, however.\n\nIn the 1850s the California Gold Rush brought economic prosperity to the area, and in 1852 the first steamboat arrived at Albany.

                    "text": "\n'''[http://www.albany.wa.gov.au/ Albany]''' is a port city on the south coast of Western Australia,  south of Perth (Western Australia)|Perth, the state capital.\n\n==Understand==\n\nAlbany is situated on Princess Royal Harbour, a natural inlet of the Southern Ocean, 5&amp;nbsp;km east west and 3&amp;nbsp;km north south. It is the oldest continuous European settlement in Western Australia, and was founded in 1826, three years before Perth. Until the construction of Fremantle Port in 1897, Albany was the only deepwater port in Western Australia.\n\nAlbany used be a whaling station and was the place from where the conveys carrying troops to the Middle East during World War 1 departed. These two events alone would make the town a worthwhile place to visit but Albany also has a very convoluted coastline giving it many kilometres of charming beaches within half an hours drive of the city centre. When one adds the marvels of the Torndirrup National Park which abuts the city you have one of West Australia's great destinations.  \nA leisurely visit to both the old whaling station and the ANZAC centre takes the better part of a day so that three or four days can easily be spent here exploring the sights, beaches and walks.\n\nWith a distinctly different climate to most Western Australia, Albany is cool and wet, with a Mediterranean climate. It receives an average of 942&amp;nbsp;mm of rainfall per annum and its average summer temperature is only 22°C.\n\nExports from the Albany port are grains, and woodchips. Imports are mainly raw materials for the production of fertilizers.\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By car===\nThe direct route on the Albany Highway from Perth is around 4 hours drive, on single carriageway road with 100-110&amp;nbsp;km/h speed limit.  There are overtaking lanes every 5–10&amp;nbsp;km or so.  The tourist attractions along this road tend to be off the route, and slightly more scenic routes add significant additional kilometres and time to the trip.\n\n===By coach===\n[http://www.transwa.wa.gov.au/ TransWA ] offers daily services to Albany.  Coaches arrive and depart from the Albany Visitor Centre, which also makes bookings and sells tickets.  These coach services replaced the passenger rail service, which closed many years ago, and no longer runs to Albany.\n\n===By plane===\n\n*  north of Albany on Albany Hwy\n| phone=+61-8-9841-9208 | tollfree= | fax=\n| hours= | price=\n| wikipedia=Albany Airport (Western Australia) | image=Albany Airport Entrance.jpg | wikidata=Q2345777\n| content=There are daily flights from Perth with Skywest.\n}}\n\n===By ship===\nSome cruise ships include Albany on their itinerary, however they are very rare.\n\n==Get around==\n\n\n===By car===\nAll areas of Albany are accessible by road.

The province is generally mountainous with scattered fertile plains and valleys. On the eastern part of the province is a line of volcanic mountains starting with the northernmost Malinao in Tiwi, followed by Mount Masaraga and the free-standing Mayon Volcano. Separated by the Poliqui Bay is the Pocdol Mountains in the town of Manito.\n\n===History===\nWhat is now Albay has been home to civilization long before the Spaniards arrived. In ancient times, it was the center of the polity of ''Ibat''  (then ''Libog''), ruled by ''Gat'' Ibal, a chieftain who also founded the ancient ''barangay'' of Sawangan in what is now Legazpi.\n\nIn July 1569, Martín de Goiti led an expedition group which crossed from Burias Islands|Burias and Ticao Island|Ticao islands and landed on a coastal settlement called ''Ibalon'' in what is now Sorsogon. From there Goiti led another expedition to explore the interior and founded the town of Camalig. In 1573, conquistador Juan de Salcedo penetrated the Bicol Peninsula from the north and created the settlement of Santiago de Libon.\n\nDuring the Spanish era, Bicol Peninsula was its own province divided into two ''partidos'', Camarines in the northwest and Ibalon in the southeast. In 1636, the two ''partidos'' became their own provinces, and what was the Ibalon became the new province of Albay, whose capital is the town of Sorsogon City|Sorsogon. Albay was frequently raided by Moro pirates from the south for most of the 17th century.\n\nMayon Volcano, in its deadliest eruption, destroyed five towns surrounding its base on 1 Feb 1814, including Cagsawa, which would become the city of Legazpi. In 1846, Masbate, Ticao and Burias islands were separated from Albay to form what would become the province of Masbate. During that time, Albay also included Catanduanes and Sorsogon.\n\n===People===\nAlbay has a population of about 1,400,000 people in 2020, and is largely ethnically Bicolano. Catholicism is the predominant religion.\n\n===Tourism information===\n* \n\n==Talk==\nAlbay is home to several languages and hosts some varieties of the Bikol languages. Out of seven Bikol languages, only one of them do not originate from Albay.\n\nMost Albay residents speak dialects of Albay Bikol, which includes the East Miraya, West Miraya, and Libon dialects. Rinconada phrasebook|Rinconada is spoken by a minority in Polangui town that borders Camarines Sur. Residents of the east coast, including Legazpi and Tabaco, speak the Tabaco-Legazpi-Sorsogon (TLS) dialect of Bikol phrasebook|Central Bikol.\n\n==Get in==\n===By plane===\n'''Bicol International Airport''' (), just adjacent to Legazpi, is served by daily flights from Manila, both on PAL Express and Cebu Pacific.\n\n===By bus===\nMany bus companies have daily trips to Legazpi or Tabaco from Manila via the Maharlika Highway. Some of the larger and more reputable bus companies are ALPS, Cagsawa Tours, DLTBCo., Philtranco and Superlines, with air-conditioned and luxury buses.\n\nFrom the south, there are also buses from Sorsogon, Samar and Leyte, and Mindanao, all via Maharlika Highway.\n\n===By car===\nThe main highway traversing Albay is the Maharlika Highway, carrying Asian Highway 26. From Camarines Sur, you can also take the Tigaon-Sagñay-Tiwi road (Rte 630) which follows a scenic route along the Pacific coast.\n\n===By train===\nThe only available services are the Bicol Commuter come from Camarines Sur, but they are slow local services that only operate on weekdays.\n\n===By ferry===\nRoll-on/roll-off ferries connect Albay with nearby Masbate and Catanduanes. Ferries from Masbate call either call at Pilar (Sorsogon)|Pilar port in Sorsogon (for boats from Masbate City and Ticao Island) and Pio Duran (from Burias Island), while those from Catanduanes call at Tabaco.\n\nLegazpi has a seaport. There are interisland ferries to the island of Rapu-rapu, an island municipality of the province of Albay.\n\n==Get around==\n\n===By bus===\nBuses form the main way of transportation between Albay’s cities and towns. Many of those services are rather segments of longer intercity routes from Manila or Naga, but there are also plenty of local buses and minibuses plying the Legazpi-Tabaco route.\n\n===By train===\nThe PNR Bicol Commuter Line serves Legazpi, Daraga, Guinobatan and Ligao, but services are limited and somewhat slower than the buses.\n\n===By car===\nMost of Albay's cities and towns are linked by national roads of decent quality, like the Maharlika Highway (Rte 1/AH26), Legazpi-Tabaco Rd (Rte 630), and Sabluyon Rd (Rte 636). Other major roads tend to be narrow, and not designed for highway speeds.

Alberobello is known as the capital of the ''trulli''.  The trullo is a fascinating architectural feature of this area of Puglia, a building with conical roof made without mortar.  Alberobello has special status internationally - designated a UNESCO world heritage site - because its collection of some 1,500 trulli in an urban environment is unique.\n\n\n\n==Understand==\n\nSome of the trulli are now used for stores, restaurants, and lodging. But many are still inhabited by locals, who are very friendly to visitors. As a world heritage site, Alberobello ''is'' a tourist attraction, but as it is less accessible from the tourist-heavy west coast, it is not overrun by tourists, and most tourists of Alberobello are Italians.\n\nThe town is the centre of an annual pilgrimage to the Basilica dedicated to the martyr saints Cosma and Damiano.\n\n==Get in==\n\n\n\nThe easiest way to reach Alberobello is by train. At Bari Centrale station, which is served by Trenitalia, look for signs to the Ferrovie Sud-Est, located within the same station. The trip takes 1 hr 30 min and tickets are sold in the ticket office next to the platform for  each way. There are 15 daily connections (some direct, some via Putignano) from Monday-Saturday. There is no need to stamp your ticket before the trip. The regional train to Alberobello is not run by Trenitalia, and thus, railpasses are not accepted.\n\nAlberobello can also be reached by car with under an hour's drive from either Bari or Brindisi airport. It is also around 30 minutes' drive from the picturesque Polignano a Mare.\n\nThere are also a few train connections to Taranto a day.\n\nFrom the station, walk to the town centre and follow signs to the Zona Monumentale Trulli (or, use any online satellite map service to locate the dense ''trulli'' region on a map). The walk takes about 15&amp;nbsp;minutes.\n\n* \n\n==Get around==\n\nAlberobello's attractions are all within walking distance. It is a very walkable town.\n\nNearby you will find within easy reach by car a number of equally fascinating towns - for example the white towns of Locorotondo, Cisternino and Ostuni, the 18th-century Baroque elegance of Martina Franca, and the Norman Romanesque centre of Conversano of Casamassima.  The caves of Castellana Grotte are spectacular, as is Putignano.\n\n==See==\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Events==\nIn summer Alberobello plays host to a number of festivals.  These include a significant international folk festival, music festivals including classical, jazz and popular music, dance, theatre, street theatre and children's events.  There are also religious festivals with music performances and firework displays.  Most of the performances are free and open-air.\n\nThe town has a vibrant passeggiata with summer strolls continuing beyond midnight.\n\n==Buy==\nThe trulli zone has many souvenir shop.\n\n'''Enoteka''' sells local goods such as cheese, sausage, spreads, cookies, wine grappa. Some give you small samples or sell you a full glass of wine for a couple of euros.\n\n*  \n\n==Eat==\n\nThere are a good number of restaurants in the tourist centre of the town, but for the best meals go a little away from the tourist trap. Casa Nova is an exception - good staff and food.\n\nFor a good restaurant in the town centre try La Cantina just off the high street, between the municipio and the basilica. Not the largest portions in town, so go there for the excellent food. A small restaurant with limited seating.\n\nFor the best all-round restaurant go where the locals go - Gli Ulivi just outside the town near the Campo Sportivo. For dinner in summer arrive soon after 20:00as the restaurant gets crowded. Food always very good, antipasto della casa is huge and in endless variety, very fresh meat well cooked. House wine excellent - eat a couple of courses with wine etc. for around  per head. Closed Wednesday.\n\n* \n\n==Drink==\n* \n\n==Sleep==\n\n\n* \n* \n*  for person a night.

It is remembered today as the site of the Battle of the Somme in World War I.\n\nDuring World War I, the statue of Mary and the infant Jesus - designed by sculptor Albert Roze and dubbed the \"Golden Virgin\" - on top of the Basilica of Notre-Dame de Brebières was hit by a shell on January 15, 1915, and was put on a horizontal position and was near falling. The Germans said that whoever made the statue fall would lose the war, and a number of legends surrounding the \"Leaning Virgin\" developed among German, French, and British soldiers. The Leaning Virgin became an especially familiar image to the thousands of British soldiers who fought at the Battle of the Somme (1916), many of whom passed through Albert, which was situated three miles from the front lines.\n\nThe German army recaptured the town in March 1918 during the Spring Offensive; the British, to prevent the Germans from using the church tower as an observation post, directed their bombardment against the basilica. The statue fell in April 1918 and was never recovered. In August 1918 the Germans were again forced to retreat, and the British reoccupied Albert until the end of the war.\n\nAlbert was completely reconstructed after the war, including widening and re-orienting the town's main streets. The Basilica, however, was faithfully rebuilt according to its original design by Eduoard Duthoit, the son of the architect who had overseen its construction in 1885-95. The present statue is an exact replica of Roze's original design, and a war memorial designed by Roze and featuring an image of the \"Leaning Virgin\" can be seen in the \"Abri\" (Shelter) Museum, which houses souvenirs of the war. The underground shelters in which the museum is located served as protective bunkers for Albert's residents during aerial bombardments in World War II.\n\nThe city also appears in a short story, The Garden of Forking Paths, by the Argentine writer Jorge Luís Borges. In the story, it is the location of a British artillery park that the Germans are about to bomb during World War I.\n\n==Get in==\n\n\n\nThe  is on the line from Paris to Lille, with a link to Calais.\n\n==Get around==\n\n==See==\n* , children  (free for children under 6 years)\n| lastedit=2018-08-07\n| content=The museum is inside a tunnel that dates back to the 13th century, and was rehabilitated into an air-raid shelter in 1938.

The rest of the province has a tiny population, but is far from empty: on this land you will find Indigenous cultures of North America|Indigenous cultures that have survived here for thousands of years, rural settlements with a proud pioneering history, and new immigrants arriving daily from all corners of the world in one of the developed world's wealthiest and fastest-growing regions.\n\nAlberta is not well known by non-Canadians, but if you do know much about it you might associate the province with the Alberta Rockies|Rocky Mountains (which in truth are only found along Alberta's western boundary), perhaps the 1988 Winter Olympics which were held in Calgary, the cowboy country of Southern Alberta, or the controversial \"oil sands\"/\"tar sands\" of Fort McMurray.\n\nIn a province as large and dynamic as Alberta, there shouldn't be any problem finding enough to see and do, no matter what your travel style is.\n\n==Regions==\n\n\n==Cities==\n\n\nBelow are 8 cities frequently considered to have the most interest for the visitor.\n\n*  - the capital city of Alberta and the second largest urban population (1,010,899 city; 1,418,118 metro region).  Known for the largest urban parks system in North America, North America's largest indoor shopping mall, and is self-proclaimed as \"Canada's Festival City\".  Also home to Western Canada's largest indoor museum (since 2018), a huge outdoor museum, the provincial art gallery, a science centre, and an iconic pyramid-shaped plant conservatory.\n*  - Alberta's largest city (1,306,784 city; 1,481,806 metro region). It is home to a beautiful river, nice museum, high-rise architecture, a world class zoo, and shopping. Famous for the 1988 Winter Olympics and the annual Calgary Stampede.\n*  - vacation destination in the Rockies offering a variety of outdoor activities. By far the busiest resort town in Alberta and one of the most popular in all of North America.\n*  - the dinosaur-lover's mecca, site of the Royal Tyrell Museum, the largest paleontology museum in Canada, set in the desert-like \"badlands\" landscape.\n*  - Banff's northerly neighbour - less visited than Banff but no less stunning.\n*  - a city in southern Alberta with a population of about 93,000 and most famous for \"coulees\" (canyons) and proximity to four world heritage sites.\n*  - is in southern Alberta with a population nearing 60,000. The main stop on the Trans-Canada Highway between Calgary and Regina, Saskatchewan and jumping-off point for the Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park|Cypress Hills.\n*  - midway between Edmonton and Calgary and, with about 100,000 people, the third largest city in the province behind those two.  The main centre for tourist services in Central Alberta.\n\n==Other destinations==\n* - the oldest and most famous of all of Canada's national parks, and home to the Banff|town of Banff which holds unique shopping and entertainment.  Outside that, there's Lake Louise and world class skiing, hiking, and camping\n*  - free ranging bison (\"buffalo\") and wapiti near Edmonton\n* - a series of parks, campgrounds, and rustic lodges, along Highway 11 between Red Deer and the Rocky Mountains.\n*  - beautiful mountain and shopping attractions without the hustle of Banff\n* - Alberta's Ukrainian ethnic enclave in Edmonton's eastern hinterland\n*  - major natural recreation area in southern Alberta at the foot of the Rockies south of Calgary\n*  - a true natural gem in the Rockies in Alberta's extreme southwest\n*  - the largest national park in Canada home to the world's largest freshwater delta and free-ranging wood bison (\"buffalo\")\n\n==Understand==\nThe province of Alberta inherited its name from one of the old districts of the North West Territories, which was named after an English princess, Louis Caroline Alberta, Duchess of Argyll (1848 – 1939), the sixth child and fourth daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.\n\nSince Alberta gained self-government as a province in 1905, its capital has been Edmonton, which is roughly in the middle of the province, while the main centre in terms of corporate headquarters is Calgary to the south. Most of the population of Alberta lives along the \"Central Corridor|Highway 2 Corridor\" between Edmonton and Calgary, although Lethbridge to the south, Grande Prairie to the northwest, and Fort McMurray to the northeast are also notable settlements of 50,000 or more.\n\nAlberta is by far the richest province in Canada in terms of average salary. Its wealth is derived mainly from oil and gas production, though historically farming and cattle raising were important. Ranching maintains an important place in the economy and culture, particularly in Southern Alberta and seventy percent of the Canadian cattle herd is in Alberta. Alberta is subject to repeated booms and busts tied to the price of oil (and gas): when the United States began producing more oil and gas through fracking in the 2010s Alberta's economy suffered for most of the next decade, with the next Albertan boom not starting until the onset of the Russian full scale invasion of Ukraine (2022-present) and the consequent spike in energy prices.\n\nAlberta is widely considered to be the most conservative area of Canada, however this is relative: Alberta has universal medical insurance, a social safety net and well-funded public education in a way that would seem \"left wing\" to many Americans. Nevertheless, Alberta is definitely distinct from the other provinces and has historically had a tense relationship with the federal government in Ottawa, mostly over control of natural resources.  These days Albertan conservatism tends to express itself as a pro-business, pro-corporate and pro-development attitude, and a suspicion of environmentalism, especially if its thought be to unfairly targeted against Alberta's petroleum industry by climate scientists and biased \"outsiders\" (usually other Canadians, but occasionally foreigners as well). This won't affect the average traveller, and many benefit as Alberta's taxes are lower than that of the rest of Canada (there is no provincial sales tax).\n\n=== History ===\n\nDeep in the interior of North America and cut off from the coasts by the Rockies to the west and the rugged Canadian Shield to the north and east, Alberta was one of the last parts of North America explored by Europeans, last to be effectively controlled by a colonial force, and the last agricultural region to be settled by non-Indigenous people. Yet this area experienced several dramatic turns in a few short decades, and went from being mostly wilderness in 1870 when it joined Canada (as a sort of colony) to a mostly agricultural but economically struggling full province by 1930, to the urbanized economic powerhouse of Canada by the 1970s, to major global investment hub and migration destination by the early 2000s, to global environmental pariah in the 2010s. \n\nThe original inhabitants were (and are) the various Indigenous cultures of North America|Indigenous people&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, who belong to a number of different ethno-linguistic groups (usually called \"First Nations\" in Canada, not \"tribes\" as in the US), namely the Cree, Blackfoot, Sarcee, Stoney, Chipewyan, Beaver, and Slavey. These peoples were all nomadic hunters at the time of European contact, so travellers will not find any giant temples or monuments to see. There are however, \"stone circles\" (like smaller versions of Stonehenge) and rock art (painting and carvings) as well as archaeological remains of camps and hunting sites, including World Heritage sites at Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park and Head Smashed In Buffalo Jump.\n\nEuropean goods arrived, second-hand, in what would be Alberta long before the European themselves did and the local Indigenous people were able to take advantage of the horse, firearms, metal tools, and so on, to make their lives much easier. However, with this trade new diseases were introduced that ''repeatedly'' devastated local communities over several centuries, opening the way for European expansion. Alberta was never seriously contested by any other European power besides Britain, or more precisely the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), a privately-owned British corporation that made money by selling animal furs in England. The HBC did have to fend off incursions from other trading companies, however, by building posts further inland, reaching Edmonton by 1795. At the same time Christian missionaries from various denominations were competing to convert the natives, often setting up missions within the walls of the trading posts. Trading posts are preserved or rebuilt at several places around the province, notably Peace Country|Dunvegan, Fort Edmonton Park, Lakeland (Alberta)|Fort George and Buckingham House, Kalyna Country|Fort Victoria, and Rocky Mountain House, with major missionary sites at the Mission Hill historic district of St. Albert, Fort Victoria, and Pigeon Lake.\n\nThe HBC recruited its traders mostly from Quebec|French Canada and Scotland's Orkney Islands.  These traders often had temporary \"country marriages\" with local Indigenous women while posted in Canada, and from these mixed marriages by the 1810s, a new population had emerged and moved into the void left by the decimation of the original groups: the \"half-breeds\", known in French (and nowadays, also in English) as the Métis.  Métis history is notably present at St. Albert and the Kalyna Country|Métis Crossing historic site.\n\nWhen the new country of Canada bought the HBC's claim to what later became Alberta in 1869, the tiny population (perhaps ten thousand) was mostly First Nations or Métis. In order to solidify Canada's claim on the region, the famous \"mounties\" (North-West Mounted Police) were sent to Alberta in 1874, establishing outposts at Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park|Fort Walsh, Cardston, Lethbridge, and Fort Macleod near the American border, and Fort Calgary and Fort Saskatchewan further north There are reconstructions of those forts preserved as open-air museums in Fort Macleod and Fort Saskatchewan and a museum on the former site of Fort Calgary. Although called \"police\", these were paramilitary forts responsible for negotiating treaties with Indigenous peoples, expelling American traders and hunters who had moved across the so-called \"medicine line\" (49th parallel), and generally asserting Canada's claim to the area. The site of the signing of Treaty #7 between Canada and the Blackfoot Confederacy in 1877 is commemorated at Southern Alberta|Blackfoot Crossing.\n\nAt this time, Indigenous people in central and southern Alberta were suffering from the near-extinction of the bison, once their primary food source, so they signed treaties in the hope of getting desperately needed emergency assistance from the Canadians. When this aid didn't always arrive when and where it was needed or without strings attached, some Cree people in Alberta decided to join a campaign of violent resistance against Canada started by a Métis community in nearby Saskatchewan. The result was the massacre of white settlers at Lakeland (Alberta)|Frog Lake in 1885, the only instance of such an attack in Alberta's history. Canada responded by sending in the military via the newly-completed Canadian Pacific Railway, crushing Indigenous resistance, hanging several warriors, confining whole communities to their small reserve lands, taking away the children to be educated in missionary schools and generally beginning a long and dark chapter of Indigenous disenfranchisement in Alberta.\n\nAt the same time the federal government offered incentives for settlers to come to Alberta, and hundreds of thousands of people arrived in Alberta between 1885 and the First World War, many from elsewhere in Canada, but also with significant ethnic pockets in various regions, such as Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian subjects (Ukrainians, Poles, Romanians, etc.) in Eastern Alberta, Scandinavians in Central Alberta, and American Mormons in Southern Alberta. With this new labour, the economy shifted to the mass export of unprocessed natural resources, notably beef, lumber, and, especially, wheat. Several Living history museums|living history and outdoor museums interpret this era of mass settlement in Alberta, the largest of which are Fort Edmonton Park, Heritage Park in Calgary, and the Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Village|Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Village.  For sites related to expansion of particular industries, try Crowsnest Pass|Leitch Collieries or Drumheller|Atlas Coal Mine for coal mining, the Wetaskiwin|Reynolds Alberta Museum or Cardston|Remington Carriage Museum for transportation and agriculture, or Longview (Alberta)|Bar U Ranch for cattle ranching.\n\nAlberta received self-government as a province in 1905, with Edmonton as the capital and the Edmonton/Central|Alberta Legislature Building was built soon thereafter in 1913 in the midst of a major land boom in that city. Most of the heritage buildings in the Edmonton/South Central|Old Strathcona neighbourhood in Edmonton date from this time.\n\nThe World War I|Great War was a tense time, with most of the British-descended majority enthusiastically backing the war effort and enlisting in the Canadian Expeditionary Force in huge numbers, while looking with suspicion upon those who did not join up, with many recently-arrived German and Austro-Hungarian subjects (most of whom were ethnic Ukrainians) placed on watch lists or even interned in camps. For the province's military story, see the Military Museums in Calgary and the Prince of Wales Armoury in Edmonton, and for the history of internment consult the two church-run Ukrainian museums in Edmonton or see the internment sites in person near Banff and Jasper.\n\nAs well there were tensions with the more urbanized parts of Central Canada, as Albertan farmers were profiting from high wartime prices.  This prosperity ground to a halt when wheat prices collapsed in 1921, just as the rest of North America was enjoying the \"roaring twenties\". This reignited simmering political tensions and led to the election of a United Farmers party government committed to bold social and political experimentation: women's suffrage and farmer-owned cooperatives taking over grain exporting from private companies were the two boldest examples.  Their efforts were all but destroyed by the Great Depression, however, and Alberta defaulted on its debts in 1935, just as the United Farmers were replaced by Social Credit party, radical in a very different way.  Social Credit tried to abolish banking and replace it with government-provided loans and a universal basic income scheme, but the plans were blocked by the courts and the federal government. This might have led to further tensions, but the Second World War intervened, and all sides rallied to the colours. For more on the turbulent politics of the early 20th century visit the Alberta Legislature or Government House (the former lieutenant governor's mansion) in Edmonton.\n\nThe World War II|Second World War again resulted in a \"suspect\" ethnic group being put into camps, this time the Japanese, who were forced to work on sugar beet farms near Taber and built difficult mountain roads, such through the Yellowhead Pass near Jasper. Besides the thousands who enlisted to serve in the Canadian Armed Forces, Alberta's other major contribution to the Allied war effort was the pilot training schools and network of airfields in Alberta that helped relay aircraft across to Alaska and on to the Soviet Union. This story is told at the Edmonton/North|Alberta Aviation Museum. Edmonton also served as the staging area for construction of the famous Alaska Highway, swelling its population with American engineers and soldiers.\n\nAlthough natural gas had already been found decades earlier in the province, the decisive date in Alberta's economic history is February 13, 1947 when a major crude oil deposit was found at Devon (Alberta)|the Leduc No. 1 oil well near Edmonton. Within a generation, small towns mushroomed into major cities with new institutions. Notable landmarks from the 1950s and 1960s era include the main university campuses in Calgary/Northwest|Calgary and Lethbridge, the twin Jubilee Auditoria (concert halls) in Edmonton and Calgary, and the Calgary Tower and Edmonton's CN Tower. As well, many of the low-density residential suburbs ringing all of Alberta's town and cities date from this time.\n\nDuring oil price spikes of the 1970s and 2000s, Alberta became one of the world's richest regions, attracting investment and immigrants from all over the globe, and this is reflected in the many skyscrapers in Edmonton and Calgary dating from those decades (or, more often, slightly after the boom had ended).  But during price falls (the 1980s and 2010s) everything went into reverse, with companies and people leaving; while many projects were finished during these times that had been started earlier, almost no new major buildings were conceived or begun during these economic busts. For example Edmonton's Edmonton/West|famous giant shopping mall was planned in the 1970s but built in the 80s, Calgary's main arena and Calgary/Northwest|Olympic park were planned during good times but opened just ahead of the 1988 Winter Olympics in the midst of a otherwise depressed economy, and Edmonton's new provincial art gallery, provincial museum, main arena, and main library, were all built in the 2010s but with money made during the 2000s. Likewise, the two tallest buildings in the province the Stantec Tower (66 stories, 250 m, 2019) in Edmonton and Brookfield Place East (56 stories, 247 m, 2017) in Calgary were both planned during a boom and finished during a bust. The booms and bust don't just produce new buildings, the also destroy old ones: there are very few pre-1947 buildings left in most of central Calgary or Edmonton because they were bulldozed in boom times to make room for something new, allowed to deteriorate during busts until they were un-salvageable, or just demolished to save money: famously Calgary's main central hospital was blown up in 1998 as a cost-cutting measure by a austerity-minded provincial government.\n\nAs cyclical as the main cities are, in resource-dependent towns like Fort McMurray or Grande Prairie, the changes from boom to bust are even more dramatic. These are problems that Albertans have been grappling with for decades now, but they have grown more complicated since the 2010s as Indigenous people have reasserted their political influence over land-use decisions (particularly the route of pipelines) and international environmental opinion has turned against the fossil fuel industry. In the 2020s Alberta will certainly be one of the hot spots in a global debate over the future of the energy industry.\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nAll of Alberta has a continental climate and is in the rain shadow of the Rockies, meaning it's mostly dry and there are profound differences between the seasons. Within Alberta there is considerable variation from north to south.\n\nNorthern Alberta has a subarctic climate; outside of Siberia, northern Alberta has some of the most dramatic seasonal variations in the world, with winter averages nearly 40 degrees Celsius lower than summer averages. Snow that falls in November often doesn't melt until April.  Summers are brief but warm and dry.\n\nThe central and southern parts of the province are slightly warmer and drier than the north. The far south is effected in winter by the \"Chinook winds\" from the Pacific that can raise the temperature 20 °C in a matter of hours, so snow often melts there even in otherwise cold months. Summers are warm and very dry, with almost no rain showers and most summer precipitation being brought only by thunderstorms.\n\n=== Read ===\n. It was once the home of famed Icelandic poet, Stephen G. Stephansson, and has been restored to how it looked in the 1920s.]]\nAs Alberta is a land of Indigenous peoples and immigrants, it should not be surprising some of Alberta's greatest literature is not in the English language. One of the greatest poets of the Icelandic phrasebook|Icelandic language, Stephan G. Stephansson (1853 – 1927), lived on a pioneer farm in Central Alberta. Some of his poetry references his time in Alberta and is available in translation.\n\nPerhaps the two most famous modern novels set in Alberta are about the struggles of ethnic minorities in this often majoritarian province. ''Obisan'' (1981) is the definitive novel of the internment of Japanese Canadians during the Second World War and is considered a classic of Canadian literature. ''Green Grass, Running Water'' (1993) is a novel of magical realism that intertwines a modern-day reworking of an Indigenous Blackfoot creation story with ordinary events on the Blackfoot Indian Reserve in Southern Alberta.\nwikipedia:Obasan\nwikipedia:Green_Grass,_Running_Water\n=== Watch ===\n\nThere are many movies and television shows that have been ''filmed'' in Alberta, but not ''set'' here (usually Alberta is masquerading as the Western United States).  To see some of Alberta's best scenery, you can watch major Hollywood releases like ''Unforgiven'' (1992), ''The Revenant'' (2015), ''Brokeback Mountain'' (2005), ''The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford'' (2007), ''Inception'' (2010), and ''Legends of the Fall'' (1994), and the HBO Series ''The Last of Us'' (2023-). But if you want to see something actually set in Alberta, try the television series ''Heartland'' (2007-2020).\n\n===Tourist information===\n* [https://www.travelalberta.com/ Travel Alberta] website\n\n==Talk==\nEnglish is the main language spoken by most people in Alberta, and 98% of the population understands it to some degree. The main minority languages are French phrasebook|French (6.7%), Filipino phrasebook|Tagalog (3.5%), and Spanish phrasebook|Spanish (2.6%), and although there are many other languages spoken by small communities within Alberta, you should only expect services at most businesses in English. The notable exceptions to this rule is that French is available at all ''federal'' government institutions (national parks, post offices, and Royal Canadian Mounted Police detachments), and services at provincial and municipal government offices are available in French in a few areas with significant Francophone communities. You might also find French services in the Campus Saint-Jean in Edmonton/South Central|Bonnie Doon neighbourhood, Edmonton.\n\nFirst Nations languages such as Cree, Dené and Blackfoot are spoken to varying degrees among those communities as both mother tongue and as a second language, but travellers at First Nations art galleries or powwows (gatherings) will have no trouble being understood in English.\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By plane===\nCalgary and Edmonton have international airports. Calgary's is the third largest in Canada (by passenger volume). It serves as the base of low-priced airline WestJet, which provides service to North American (mainly Canadian), Mexican and Caribbean destinations. Edmonton's was the fastest growing in Canada (before COVID) with multiple recent expansions, and had recovered to pre-pandemic levels as of early 2023. International service is provided by several carriers at both locations, including multiple direct flights to London and Frankfurt each day. Other destinations are usually connected to through Vancouver or Toronto. Both airports act as collection points, Calgary for the prairie provinces, and Edmonton for destinations in the Canadian North like Grande Prairie and Yellowknife.\n\n=== By train ===\n\n\n*  Operates the following routes in Alberta:\n** The Canadian (between Toronto, Ontario and Vancouver, British Columbia) two to three times per week. Stops in Alberta include Edmonton and Jasper. Other major stops include from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and Winnipeg, Manitoba\n** \"The Skeena\" (between Jasper and Prince Rupert, British Columbia) Trip involves an overnight stay in Prince George, British Columbia. Operates twice per week.\n\nThere is no passenger rail service into Calgary, except for the exorbitantly-priced, slow and irregular [https://www.royalcanadianpacific.com/ Royal Canadian Pacific]. The Rocky Mountaineer operates luxury sightseeing trains out of Vancouver to Jasper, Lake Louise and Banff, with an overnight stop in Kamloops, in the summer months. While much cheaper than the Royal Canadian Pacific, the Rocky Mountaineer still sports a hefty price tag. The route Jasper uses part of the same track as The Canadian, but only travels during daylight hours, thus maximizing the time you will get to enjoy the scenery. These run as nostalgia, not as practical transportation.\n\n=== By bus ===\n* \n*  The following routes travel between Alberta and out of province destinations:\n** Between Vancouver and Calgary via cities including Kamloops and Banff.\n** Between Regina and Edmonton via cities including Saskatoon and Lloydminster.\n** Between Regina and Calgary via cities including Medicine Hat and Lethbridge.\n* \n* \n\n=== By car ===\nThere are land border crossing with the United States at (form west to east) Chief Mountain, Carway, Del Bonita, Coutts, Aden, and Wild Horse. The most important of which certainly Coutts, which connects Interstate Highway System|Interstate 15 to Alberta Highway 4 onward to Lethbridge. Some of these may not operate 24 hours per day at all times of the year, so plan to cross the border during daylight hours or check the [https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/bwt-taf/menu-eng.html Canada Border Services Agency website] for exact times.\n\nTo enter from British Columbia, there are a limited number highways (generally through mountain passes) that can be used, from north to south the most notable are where Highway 2 (in British Columbia) / Highway 43 (Alberta) crosses near Dawson Creek, Highway 16 (Yellowhead Highway) at Yellowhead Pass in Jasper National Park, Highway 1 (Trans-Canada Highway) at Kicking Horse Pass, Highway 93 crosses at Vermilion Pass, and Highway 3 (Crowsnest Highway) Crowsnest Pass.\n\nFrom Saskatchewan, since there are no mountains in the way there are literally thousands of local roads connecting the two provinces but the main ones of interest to tourists would be (from north to south) the Highway 16 (Yellowhead Highway) connecting Saskatoon to Edmonton; Saskatchewan 14 where it meets Alberta 13 to connect either Saskatoon or Regina to Red Deer; Saskatchewan 7 where it meets Alberta 9 connecting Saskatoon to Calgary, Highway 1 (Trans-Canada Highway) to connect Regina to Medicine Hat, Lethbridge and Calgary.\n\nFrom the Northwest Territories there is only one highway (NWT 1, Alberta 35), plus the option of using the infamous \"ice roads\" in the winter.\n\n=== By thumb ===\nHitchhiking is illegal and rare in Alberta, so this is not recommended, but it is possible if you're willing to take your chances.\n\n=== By bicycle ===\nThe vast distances make cycling across Western Canada all but impossible, the lack of dedicated infrastructure also makes it relatively dangerous, and the sparsity of things to see in the spaces between towns (outside of the Rockies) makes it quite boring. This should not stop you from cycling ''within'' certain parts of Alberta, which is a much more manageable project. But if you're extremely fit, have '''&lt;u&gt;lots of time to spare&lt;/u&gt;''' and like a challenge, you can legally cycle on all of Alberta's highways or try the part of the Trans Canada Trail that crosses the province.\n\n==Get around==\nAlberta is quite large and sparsely populated, as are most Canadian provinces.  For some comparisons with other parts of Commonwealth of Nations|the Commonwealth, Alberta is twice as big as Rajasthan (the largest state in India) but with 1/16th of its population, or three-quarters the size of Nigeria, but with 1/50th of the population.\n\nAlbertan cities are infamous for their low-density \"suburban sprawl\" and are thus really big, area wise and difficult to walk without at least a little assistance from other modes of travel. Luckily both Edmonton and Calgary have bicycle paths, light rail transit (LRT) trains, extensive bus networks, taxi fleets, ride-hailing apps, and since 2019 rentable electric scooters. Outside of those two cities, however, options are more limited.\n\nCar travel is almost essential unless you plan on staying within Edmonton or Calgary. It is certainly possible, though expensive, to fly to many of the smaller cities from Edmonton or Calgary, although those places are even more car-dependent so you would need to rent a car while there or be essentially stranded. An inter-city \"bus\" (coach) is much cheaper than a flight but will take up a lot of time given the distances involved and still leaves you without a car when you arrive in an isolated small town.\n\n=== By car ===\n\n\nDriving regulations are the same as in most of Canada. Turning right (far right lane into far right lane) on a red light is allowed. Drunk driving is taken very seriously, but is disproportionately seen in rural areas; take care when driving there at night. Wildlife is another major concern. When driving on the highways, maintain a reasonable speed and look for sudden movements on the side. The most common animal hit is the deer (white-tailed or mule), which is usually not fatal for the car. But running into an elk or moose could be so. Moose are very dark coloured so keep a close eye out for them. If you see animals on the side of the road it is common to want to slow down. Do so in a safe manner and don't needlessly impede traffic. Don't get out of your car to see the animals.\n\nThe Government of Alberta operates [https://511.alberta.ca/#:Alerts 511 Alberta],a free traveller information service that may be accessed via phone, mobile device, or computer. The information covers highway conditions, roadwork, major incidents, weather alerts, availability of ferry services, and waiting times at border crossings. Users within Alberta may access the information via phone toll-free by simply calling 5-1-1, similar to the way they would call 9-1-1 for emergencies or 4-1-1 for directory assistance. Computer and mobile device users may also visit the 511 Alberta web site at www.511.alberta.ca.  Likewise the [https://roadreports.ama.ab.ca/ Alberta Motor Association (AMA)] is another good source of specific information. Calgary and Edmonton offer traffic radio stations - government-funded radio that only reports accidents, construction and weather. Watch for signs featuring the frequency in these cities.\n\nDo not heed any warning about Albertan drivers being the most aggressive drivers in Canada - a common myth. They are not more so than Toronto and certainly are nothing compared with Southern Europe. High speeds and lane changes without signalling are generally the worst it gets.\n\n===By bus===\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n&lt;!-- Ended as of Sep 29, 2023\n* \n--&gt;\n* \n* \n* \n\n==See==\nDriving west out of Calgary towards British Columbia, the Rockies rise dramatically and quickly. The drive through Banff, Jasper or Glacier National Park (Montana)|Glacier National Park can be quite spectacular. The Icefields Parkway between the towns of Banff and Jasper is definitely not to be missed.\n\nIn Edmonton, '''West Edmonton Mall''' is one of the province's larger attractions. With over 800 retail shops and the world's largest indoor entertainment centre, it's entertaining even for the non-shoppers.  Edmonton calls itself '''\"Canada's Festival City\"''' so there are many things to do throughout the summer, most notably the world's second oldest and largest '''Fringe Theatre Festival''' (just behind Edinburgh) in mid-August, the '''Edmonton Heritage Festival''', the world's largest festival devoted to multiculturalism (first weekend of August), and a large midway and free-admission concert series in July called '''K-Days'''. The city also boasts North America's largest urban parkland system, which is very beautiful and completes the skyline over the '''North Saskatchewan River Valley'''.\n\nCalgary offers the '''Calgary Stampede''', the wild west-themed festival held every July complete with rodeos and fairs. One should also check out the '''Calgary Zoo''' and get a view from the top of the '''Calgary Tower'''.\n\n===Itineraries===\nIt is easy for people from more densely populated and well-travelled Old World countries visiting Alberta (or Canada) to underestimate the vast distances involved, and the sparse availability of tourist-focused accommodations (as opposed to industry-focused), and other tourist services in the rural areas.  Nevertheless, with proper research and planning, a pleasant trip is easily achievable.\n\n==== On the way to Alaska ====\n\nMany Americans pass through Alberta on their way to the famous Alaska Highway. There are &lt;u&gt;numerous&lt;/u&gt; routes to take to get to the start of the highway at Dawson Creek near the B.C.-Alberta border. The exact route you choose will largely depend on where in the United States you are coming from. Most people with budget and time constraints pick their route first and decide what to see along the way later. If, however, you are interested in seeing the best of Alberta, even if it takes you off the most direct path, then consult the \"circle tour\" below, which can easily be modified into a through route by doing either the western (Rocky Mountain) or eastern (prairie) sections.\n\nIf, however, you are mostly concerned about \"making time\", the most direct route from Montana would be '''Alberta Highway 2''' (also called the Queen Elizabeth II Highway or \"QE2\") from Interstate 15 to Edmonton, a short bit of Alberta Highway 16 (Yellowhead Highway), then Alberta Highway 43 to Grande Prairie, and a short bit of Highway 2 again to Dawson.\n\nIf time and money are no object, there is also the famous \"'''scenic route to Alaska'''\" (if you think the thousands of miles of wilderness you're about to pass through aren't long and scenic enough) which follows Alberta Highway 40 and which provides a beautiful but isolated route from the Rockies to Grand Prairie.\n\n==== Circle tour ====\nAssuming you were starting in Calgary, had a week or more to spend, and didn't mind a few longer drives, this would cover virtually '''''every major attraction in the province'''''. It could be done in either direction, or using Edmonton or Lethbridge as the starting or end points instead.\n\nFrom Calgary International Airport, drive 80 km (1 hr) to find Diamond Valley (former twin towns of Black Diamond and Turner Valley) which hosts Alberta's early energy industry history at the Turner Valley Gas Plant historic site (seasonal May to September). From there learn about two different historic industries at Bar U Ranch National Historic Site (35 km, 30 min) to learn about cowboy culture, then 129 km (1½ hr) to Crowsnest Pass to see the coal mining history of the region at Frank Slide and Leitch Collieries historic sites and a restored police barracks at the Crowsnest Museum.  Camp or rent a cabin in Crowsnest.\n\nThe next day, drive to the UNESCO World Heritage Site at Head Smashed In Buffalo Jump (140 km, 1½ hr) to learn about ancient Indigenous hunting practices and then continue to Waterton Lakes National Park (100 km, 1 hr) to see the Rockies up close and stay there a day or two to hike, or take the lake ferry into Montana (USA) and back.\n.|276x276px]]\nOn the next travel day, drive to Cardston (55 km, ¾ hr) to see the grain elevators, Mormon temple, and Remington-Alberta Carriage Museum, then on to Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park (155 km, 1½ hr) to see the petroglyphs (rock carvings).  This is the ''southernmost point'', where you could continue into Montana if you like.  You can also camp here or drive to Lethbridge (130 km, 1½ hr) for your choice of hotels and see the Japanese gardens while you are there.  An extension is possible here to Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park as well.\n\nFrom Lethbridge, it's 200 km (2¼ hr) to Dinosaur Provincial Park where you can have a guided bus tour and walk in the \"badlands\" and see the dig site where many of Alberta's dinosaur fossils have been found, and another 170 km (1¾ hr) to the Royal Tyrell Museum in Drumheller where those same fossils are displayed in one of the world's greatest dinosaur exhibits. Camping and hotels are both available in \"Drum\" but plan ahead as it is very busy during high season.\n|273x273px]]\nThe next day drive 30 km (½ hr) north to the ghost town of Rowley (Alberta) to sight-see (or nearby Big Valley (Alberta)|Big Valley to see the \"creation museum\") before continuing to Wetaskiwin (190 km, 2 hr), to see the Reynolds-Alberta Museum with its huge collection of automobiles, aircraft, and machinery. The following day, drive 110 km (1¼ hr) to Elk Island National Park to explore the Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Village outdoor museum explaining Alberta's Eastern European heritage (seasonal May to September) and see the famous bison (buffalo) herds, then camp here or drive to Edmonton for a hotel (35 km to the Strathcona County|easternmost suburbs, 50 km to Edmonton/Central|the City Centre). While there, get lost in Canada's largest shopping mall and entertainment complex and see the art gallery, museum, and arena. This is the ''northernmost point'' on this itinerary, but only the centre of Alberta. Continue north from here if you are going to the Alaska Highway, for example.\n\nEdmonton to Jasper is the longest stretch on this itinerary at nearly 4 hours, so consider stopping at Wabamun Lake or Pembina River Provincial Park for a picnic, or go in to Edson or Hinton for a restaurant meal, or shorten the trip and stay in a cabin or tipi (indigenous-style tent) in Brule. At Jasper, you are back in the Rockies with lots of hikes to do or a gondola to ride if you prefer.\n\nFrom Jasper the world-famous Icefields Parkway (230 km, 3 hr) takes you to Lake Louise, reputed to be one of the most beautiful places on earth.  If you can afford it, the Chateau Lake Louis hotel is one of Canada's most famous, otherwise proceed to Banff (55 km, 45 min) or Canmore (an additional 25 km, 20 min) for more reasonable accommodations but still in the beautiful setting of the Canadian Rocky Mountains. There are more hikes and drives from here and the town of Banff is also home to several historic sites and museums and lots of touristy shops. From here, you can make side trips to Kananaskis Country for more mountains or Cochrane (Alberta)|Cochrane to get back to cowboy country.\n\nFinally from Canmore to Calgary's airport is 120 km, or 1 hr 15 min in good traffic.\n\n====Icefields Parkway====\nConsidered one of the world's most scenic single-day drives, from Lake Louise to Jasper, you drive right past the edge of the Columbia Glacier, the largest glacier in northern hemisphere outside of the Arctic.\n\nThis can easily to turned into a circle tour (see above) by adding stops in Edmonton and Calgary. It can also be part of a route to Alaska by linking with Alberta Highway 40 (see above).\n\n====Big stuff tour====\n\n\nDuring the mid twentieth century there was a mania for building roadside attractions in Alberta, especially if it could be called the \"world's largest\".  For example:\n*  World's biggest '''Baseball Bat''' – Edmonton (''Edmonton/North|North Edmonton'')\n*  World's largest '''Baseball glove''' – Heisler (Alberta)|Heisler\n*  World's biggest '''Beaver''' – Beaverlodge\n*  World's biggest '''Bee''' – Falher\n*  World's biggest '''Chuckwagon''' – Dewberry\n*  World's biggest '''Dinosaur''' – Drumheller\n*  World's biggest '''Dragonfly''' – Wabamun\n*  World's biggest '''Golf Putter''' – Bow Island\n*  World's largest '''Golf Tee''' – Trochu\n*  World's biggest '''Mallard Duck''' – ''Whitford Lake Bird Sanctuary'' (Andrew)\n*  World's biggest '''Mushrooms''' – Vilna\n*  World's largest '''Oil Lamp''' – Donalda\n*  World's biggest '''Perogy''' – Glendon\n*  World's biggest '''Piggy Bank''' – Crowsnest Pass|Crowsnest Pass (Coleman)\n*  World's biggest '''Pysanka Easter Egg''' – Vegreville\n*  World's largest '''Railroad Spike''' – Hines Creek (Alberta)|Hines Creek\n*  World's biggest '''Sausage''' – Mundare\n*  Susie the World's largest '''Softball''' – Chauvin\n*  World's biggest '''Star Trek Enterprise Replica''' – Vulcan (Alberta)|Vulcan\n*  World's biggest '''Sun dial''' – Lloydminster\n*  World's biggest '''Tipi''' – Medicine Hat\n*  World's first '''UFO landing pad''' – St. Paul (Alberta)|St. Paul\n*  World's largest '''Weather Vane''' – Westlock\n*  World's largest '''Western Boot''' –  Edmonton (''Edmonton/West End|West End'')\n\nFor more, visit: [https://roadsideattractions.ca/roadside/alberta.html Large Canadian Roadside Attractions]\n\n=== Indigenous tourism ===\n\nThe major year-round places to learn about Indigenous culture would be the Royal Alberta Museum in Central Edmonton, Fort Edmonton Park in Edmonton/West End|West Edmonton, the Glenbown Museum in downtown Calgary, the Buffalo Nations Luxton Museum in Banff, Blackfoot Crossing on the Siksika reserve near Strathmore, Head Smashed In Buffalo Jump near Fort Macleod, Heritage Park in Calgary, Tsuut'ina Nation Culture/Museum just outside Calgary.  Seasonal sites include Metis Crossing in Kalyna Country, Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park near Milk River, and the Majorville Cairn and Medicine Wheel near Bassano.\n\nOne of the best ways to see Indigenous culture up close is to take in a \"powwow\" (a festival centred around dancing, drumming, and singing competitions).  Most \"reserves\" (as First Nations communities are often called)  have at least one each summer; for a listing see [https://windspeaker.com/powwows Windspeaker]. There are also two famous ones attached to the Calgary Stampede and Edmonton's \"K-Days\" fair in July. Several stand-alone powwows are also found in cities now as well, often around National Indigenous Day on June 20th. Events are also common around National Truth and Reconciliation Day in late September or during National Métis Week during the first week of November. Increasingly, Indigenous themes are integrated into other types of festivals, such as the arts, notably the Dreamspeakers International Film Festival in Edmonton the last week of April and the Rubaboo Arts Festival the following week.\n\nIndigenous-inspired cuisine is surprisingly difficult to find in Alberta, partly due to (overly?) strict regulations on using wild-harvested meats and plants. Compared to the Fine dining|Nordic countries, there is comparatively little emphasis on using wild foods among Albertan chefs. It is possible to find farmed bison and elk meat but it is much more expensive than beef for a similar taste, which perhaps explains the lack of uptake. The one Indigenous food than every Albertan knows, \"bannock\" (fry bread or flat bread), is very recent in origin. To be sure, for thousands of years Indigenous people here made various kinds of flat bread from flours made of maize, nuts, roots, and so on. But the modern recipe of wheat flour, lard, and baking soda, is entirely based on goods introduced by Canadian fur traders in the last 250 years. Nevertheless, bannock is considered thoroughly nativized, and you will find it at every museum and powwow.\n\nShopping for Indigenous souvenirs typically means leather clothing, especially moccasins (slippers) and mittens, decorated with glass beads. Other handicrafts could include tobacco pipes, saddles, parkas (fur coats) and ribbon skirts.  Nowadays, however, many Indigenous artists prefer to work in media like sculpture and painting and their work can be found more often at art galleries than at souvenir shops on the sides of highways.\n\n==Do==\nThe main attraction in Alberta (outside of the two big cities) are the open spaces and the proximity to nature. This is a good place to visit if you like the idea of outdoor life.\n=== Outdoor life ===\n\nHorse riding is a major attraction here, especially in the south and west: cowboy country. Guest ranches and trail rides are plentiful.\n\nThe ski resorts of Marmot Basin in Jasper National Park, and Sunshine Village, Lake Louise and Norquay in Banff National Park dish up almost every kind of terrain for the hardcore skier, yet allow novice skiers to have fun through green runs and long cruising runs. If the crowds bother you, there are other, smaller, ski areas in the province.\n\nGreat hiking can be had in the Rocky Mountains (Canada)|Rockies or on Alberta's sections of the Trans Canada Trail.\n\nThere are a few lakes that allow one to do boating, \"sea-dooing\" (jetskiing) or most other watersports despite Alberta's landlocked nature.\n\nThere are many excellent golf courses available to the public across the provinces. Areas of particular interest include the mountain parks where Banff Springs, Jasper Park Lodge, Kananaskis Country, Stewart Creek, and Silver Tip are recognized as some of Canada's best courses. Central Alberta also offers several excellent courses, including Wolf Creek and Alberta Springs. In the Edmonton area, popular courses include the Northern Bear, Cougar Creek, The Ranch, and Goose Hummock. In Drumheller, the back nine of the Dinosaur Point Golf Course features several very dramatic and spectacular holes.\n\nOffroad driving using \"quad\" bikes, trucks, dirtbikes, and even Snowmobile|snowmobiles is practically the official sport in Alberta. If it is loud, fast, and spews noxious emissions, it can be bought or rented in Alberta.\n\n=== Events ===\nThe biggest festivals in the province are the Calgary Stampede in July combining rodeo and carnival and Edmonton's Fringe Festival in August showcasing avant-garde theatre and street performers. However, hosting festivals has become the unofficial provincial obsession, especially in the short summer months, so expect local media and social media to have lots of suggestions ''every day'' from May to September and at least weekly the rest of the year.  Notable genres of festival include modern folk music (Calgary, Edmonton, Canmore), film (Edmonton, Calgary, Banff), food trucks (Edmonton, Calgary), multi-ethnic food and dance (Edmonton, Calgary), rodeo (Calgary, Red Deer, Ponoka), as well as street festivals for each of the province's main ethnic communities, notably the Ukrainians (Edmonton, Calgary, Ukrainian Village museum, Vegreville, Lamont), Indigenous peoples (province-wide around summer solstice, as well as sporadically the rest of the year), and in Edmonton and Calgary: Caribbean carnivals, Latin American fiestas, Filipino street parties, and more.\n\n=== Sports ===\nAlberta is one of the world's heartlands of Ice hockey in North America|ice hockey. Two of world's top professional teams located here in Edmonton and Calgary playing from September to April, and if they qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs, possibly as late as June.  But if you'd just like an inexpensive taste of the game without overpriced beer, laser light shows, and deafening music that have infected the professional game, there are dozens of elite amateur and university teams found across the province. Hockey is so popular here that people had to enter a lottery just for the ''chance'' to buy tickets to the (later postponed) under-21 Men's World Championships in Edmonton and Red Deer in January 2022.\n\nWinter sports more generally are easy to try here, with Calgary's Canada Olympic Park being a good place to try bobsleigh, for example. And every small town and city neighbourhood will have a skating rink with public skating times and a curling rink, where locals can show you how to throw a stone if you're willing to ask.\n\nRodeo is a major sport here as well, often tied in to the main fair of many towns, including even big-city Calgary. Check the \"see\" section above to watch rodeo, but you can't really \"do\" rodeo without being trained first. A better idea is to try a dude ranch first.\n== Learn ==\nAlberta is a popular destination for international students, primarily at the university level, but also at colleges and high schools. There are dozens of institutions that are designated as international student ready, so the best idea is to consult the [https://www.alberta.ca/international-students-studying-alberta.aspx provincial government's website on the topic].\n\nThe most popular choice would undoubtedly be the Edmonton/South Central|University of Alberta in Edmonton which has one of Canada's largest medical schools and teaching hospitals as well as schools of dentistry, pharmacy, engineering, business, and others that are popular with foreign learners.  Classes in all these disciplines are available in English and sometimes also in French.  The University of Calgary also has a similar offering of faculties.\n\n==Eat==\n\nSince Alberta was settled after the industrial revolution was already well established, it completely lacks a regional food culture based on millennia of peasant traditions as one would expect in the Old World or even many local specialties based on a few generations of adaptation and hybridization as you might expect in longer-settled parts of North America. What it does have is an abundance of quality beef (and bison!), raised on its rich grasses and finished on local barley (not corn [maize], as in the US) and a high tolerance for international influences, going back right to the beginning when men from China's Fujian province often worked as cooks in railway-building camps. To this was added the British influence, American cowboy traditions, and continental European dishes. As a result the smallest towns will have a \"Chinese café\" usually serving an odd assortment of hamburgers, spring rolls, won ton soup, \"perogies\" (Ukrainian dumplings), and poutine. In the bigger towns and suburban neighbourhoods this quirky eclecticism has sadly been largely replaced by an assortment of chain restaurants. However, in the main resort towns of the Rockies one can find fine dining, and in the two major cities it is possible to find a number of more experimental restaurants as well as variety of ethnic dishes from every corner of the globe, due to recent immigration (Calgary has the province's only Uzbek restaurant, for example). The only thing truly hard to find is good seafood; but when in Rome do as the Romans do, and when in Alberta, go for beef. If you're vegetarian, you will still be distinctly in the minority and might suffer from a lack variety outside the major cities, though even the big chains are much better than in years past.\n\n==Drink (and smoke)==\n\nThe drinking age is 18 - younger than most other provinces in Canada. Alcohol is available from the many private liquor stores and beer/wine stores throughout the province. Unlike other provinces, liquor retail is privatized, there's no government-owned alcohol monopoly; unlike most American states, you cannot buy alcohol directly in grocery stores, although many grocery stores have liquor stores in unattached buildings nearby.\n\nSince 2018, possession of 30 grams of recreational cannabis has been legal everywhere in Canada. You can find cannabis retail stores in most towns and cities in Alberta, which has the most of any province. As with alcohol and unlike the other provinces Alberta has chosen to let private business do the selling.\n\nProduction of craft beer and spirits were significantly deregulated in 2015, leading to an explosion of new microbreweries and distilleries. The province is now home to a burgeoning craft scene. Even small towns like Lacombe are now home to breweries making once-obscure brews like fruited kettle sours.\n\n== Buy ==\nThe main attraction is Edmonton/West End|West Edmonton Mall, which was the world's largest shopping centre from 1983 to 2004 and includes over 800 shops, an ice rink, an indoor waterslide park and wave pool, a bowling alley, a gun range, a minigolf course, an amusement park, a multiscreen cinema, a casino, two hotels, over 100 restaurants or food kiosks, several bars and nightclubs and parking for more than 20,000 vehicles. This is really more of an enclosed neighbourhood than a \"mall\" as typically conceived. It is Alberta's most visited attraction with over 32 million visitors each year.\n\nBesides that, there are other smaller malls, typical \"high streets\" in Edmonton and Calgary and two notably large \"power centres\" (outdoor malls), South Edmonton Common in Edmonton and CrossIron Mills in Calgary Region|Balzac near Calgary.\n\nUniquely among the provinces, Alberta does not have a provincial sales tax, although the federal 5% sales tax still applies and is ''added to the price at the till'' and is not shown on price tags.\n\n==Stay safe==\n\nThe following areas of Alberta are considered higher risk areas with respect to crime.\n* Calgary - walking during night hours should be avoided in the East Village, Victoria Park, and the Bow River Pathway between Eau Claire Market and the Calgary Zoo. These areas are prone to drugs and prostitution. There are panhandlers on various downtown streets.\n* Edmonton - an area northeast of downtown is a prostitution stroll. There is also a stretch of Whyte Avenue that can be a problem after 7PM, given its high bar concentration.\n\nOtherwise, Alberta as a whole is a relatively safe area. However common sense should be applied. Do not leave valuables visible in vehicles and lock all vehicle doors.\n\nGrowth in urban centres in Alberta has led to increased traffic. Allow plenty of time to reach a destination, especially during rush hour or during adverse weather.\n\nAlberta's weather is very changeable and volatile, especially in the mountains and the foothills and also during the spring season. Driving conditions can deteriorate quickly. Before going out, always check the local forecast. Road conditions are available through the [https://ama.ab.ca/ Alberta Motor Association].\n\nDuring winter strong Chinook winds in the foothills, especially south of Calgary, can blow a vehicle off the road. Highways 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 22 and 23 south of Calgary are the most vulnerable to these conditions, with Highway 22 usually being the worst. Extra caution is advised, particularly for higher-height vehicles such as trucks and SUVs.\n\nAlberta has had cases of the West Nile Virus. In the spring and summer, it is wise to be protected using Deet-based repellents.\n\nThe area within and around the mountain parks is bear country. Hikers, hunters and campers in these areas should follow all Aggressive animals#Bears|bear safety tips. Campsites should be kept clean, all dishes properly washed, and all tables wiped clean after a meal. Never leave any food or garbage loose or unattended. Hikers should travel as a group, make noise regularly and stay on established trails. Pets should be kept out of bear country.\n\nTaxis can be in short supply in Calgary and Edmonton at times, especially during holidays, poor weather, and on weekends. It is advisable to phone ahead in the daytime for a reservation if you realize you may need a taxi. In most cases, taxis are easily available at the airports.\n\nDuring summers tornadoes are not uncommon and happen most in central Alberta. Edmonton has been hit by many tornadoes, the biggest of which was an F4 in 1987. Hail is very common during these storms — usually very small but sometimes as big as softballs. Check Environment Canada about risks.\n\n==Go next==\nSince Alberta shares the Rocky Mountains with British Columbia (to the west) and several American states (to the south and southwest), travellers interested in skiing, camping, hiking and other outdoor pursuits not need not limit themselves to just the Albertan section of the mountain chain. The other major cities with notable attractions and international air connections near to Alberta—relatively, but still many hours drive away— would be Vancouver, Seattle, or Denver, though there are intra-U.S. connections via smaller airports like Billings or Spokane as well.\n\nA less common path is to the east or southeast, into the wide open spaces of the Great Plains. Here there are no rail connections and few major airports, so driving is virtually a must. When travelling across Saskatchewan or the northern tier of the neighbouring states, you are far from the usual tourist trail, but you can find little-known natural gems here like Grasslands National Park or the Great Sandhills. For urban destinations, the only other main city on the Canadian Prairies to rival Calgary or Edmonton is Winnipeg, with its historic centre, Canadian Museum of Human Rights and an international airport. A little further to the south, major attractions like the Badlands and Black Hills region of South Dakota are accessible with enough time, and from there on to more commonly-travelled parts of the U.S.A.\n\nThe most adventurous next step from Alberta is certainly to the north, where literally millions of square miles of boreal forests are to be found.  The Alaska Highway through the Yukon is the obvious choice in terms of routes to the great north country, but consider also the Northwest Territories for those who truly want to be off the beaten path.\n\nOf course, once you've mastered the rugged-mountains-and-vast-arid-plains combination of Alberta perhaps you'd like to compare to similar experiences on the other side of the globe. Consider Australia's Great Dividing Range and Outback, Russia's Urals and Steppes, South Africa's Drakensberg and Veld, or Argentina's Andes and Pampas.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Most of these polders, unlike polders such as the Beemster and Flevoland, are not reclaimed lakes or seas, but instead are reclaimed from the many riverbanks of the many rivers that meander through the region.\n\n==Destinations==\n\n, \n| region4description=As its name implies, Molenlanden is a land of windmills, featuring the well-known Kinderdijk.\n\n| region5name=Papendrecht\n| region5color=#578E86\n| region5items=\n| region5description=Example of the dike-villages found around the river Merwede.\n\n| region6name=Sliedrecht\n| region6color=#4F93C0\n| region6items=\n| region6description=Somewhat industrial city that made itself a name through its dredging companies, and additionally a gateway into the Biesbosch National Park.\n\n| region7name=Zwijndrechtse Waard\n| region7color=#5BCC48\n| region7items=, \n| region7description=Mostly acting as an extension of Rotterdam, this former island definitely has some character of its own.\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==Understand==\nAlblasserwaard and the Drechtsteden are two regions (Dutch: ''Landstreken'') of the Netherlands. The Alblasserwaard is located between the rivers Lek in the north, the Merwede (Boven-Merwede and Beneden Merwede) in the south, the Oude Zederik, Merwedekanaal and Linge to the east and the Noord in the west. The region has been named after the Alblas river, which was once a heavily used river in the region.\nThe Drechtsteden consist of most of the Dutch cities which have their names end with 'Drecht'. These include Dordrecht, Papendrecht, Sliedrecht and Zwijndrecht. These cities count some 270.000 citizens in total, spread over  of land. The Drechtsteden, which literally means 'Drecht-cities', only consists of the cities of such a name found along the Beneden-Merwede, Noord and Oude Maas rivers. The Netherlands, however, counts many more 'Drechtsteden' throughout the country. Alblasserwaard-Drechtsteden is best known for the iconic and well-known Kinderdijk.\n\n==Talk==\n\n==Get in==\n===By car===\nThe region is crossed by three highways, the A15, A16 and A27/E311. The A15 is the highway that visits most of the destinations in the region. From cities such as Hilversum, Utrecht and Almere, use the A27 heading south, turning onto the A15 going west at Gorinchem. This is also where you will find exit 27, which services Gorinchem. The highway then goes on to connect to Hardinxveld, Sliedrecht, Papendrecht and Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht in that order. Dordrecht can be reached by following the N3 from exit 23, servicing Papendrecht. Zwijndrecht can be reached by following directions through Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht, or by following the A15, turning onto the A16 when it terminates, not heading for Rotterdam, and then using exit 22 to enter Zwijndrecht.\nFrom Amsterdam, either travel to Hilversum using the A1 or Utrecht using the A2 following the directions above, or head to Leiden and Den Haag using the A4 up to Rotterdam. Here, cross the Nieuwe Maas. Shortly after, the A4 will terminate, at which point you turn towards the east, onto the A15. This highway runs alongside the A16 for a few kilometres, after which the two go their separate ways. Following the A15 will get you past Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht, Papendrecht and the others as described above. Again stay on the A16 to get to Zwijdrecht and Dordrecht. From most of the North and East Netherlands, first travel to Arnhem, from which you follow the A50 heading for Utrecht. Follow directions to Wijchen, which will get you onto the A50. At ''Knooppunt Valburg'', turn onto the A15 heading for Tiel. Following the highway after passing Tiel will get you to Gorinchem, from which the directions from Hilversum can be followed.\n\n===By public transit===\nAlblasserwaard-Drechtsteden can be reached by public transit rather easily. From Rotterdam, The Hague, Breda, 's-Hertogenbosch, Lelystad or Roosendaal, take a train to Dordrecht. You'll be able to choose between NS' Sprinter and Intercity services, of the latter is the faster option. The Sprinters from 's-Hertogenbosch, Roosendaal and Den Haag, however, stop at |lat=51.8153 | long=4.6412}} before terminating at |lat=51.8074 | long=4.6677}}. From here, most busses service the surrounding cities.\nMost of Alblasserwaard is serviced by Arriva, connecting to the aforementioned station in Dordrecht, running along the river Merwede up to |lat=51.8337 | long=4.9676}}, after which the service runs through some of Vijfheerenlanden before eventually terminating in Geldermalsen, which can be reached using Sprinter services from Utrecht, 's-Hertogenbosch, Tiel and Den Haag|Den Haag Centraal.\n\nAs of Apr 2023, [https://www.qbuzz.nl/dmg/ Qbuzz] operates buses in the Drechtsteden - Molenlanden - Gorinchem area.\n\n==Get around==\n\n==See==\n\n==Do==\n\n==Stay safe==\n\n==Go next==\n\n\n\n"

                    "text": "\n'''Albufeira''' is a city (''cidade'') and municipality (''concelho'') in the district of Faro (Algarve). Albufeira is one of the most popular and internationally famous holiday destinations in the Algarve, the most southern and sunniest region of continental Portugal. The resorts and hotels extend from Olhos d'Agua to Galé along the beautiful rocky coastline of the area.  Many holiday makers return year after year because of the lovely beaches, very good climate, proximity of many restaurants, bars and pubs.\n\n==Understand==\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce a small fishing village, Albufeira (Portuguese phrasebook#Wikivoyage pseudo-phoneticization|ahl-boo-FAY-ruh, /aɫ.bu.ˈfɐj.ɾɐ/) has developed to be a very touristy area. It's not a place to experience any level of authentic Portugal, as any local culture is overwhelmed by foreign-themed businesses.\n\nThe origins of Albufeira date back to the prehistoric period. Later it was settled by the Romans, who called it \"Baltum\". The name of Albufeira goes back to the time of the Moors \"Al-Buhera\", as the town in the 8th century was an important trading centre. There are hardly any remains from this period, only a plaque to commemorate the former Moorish castle on the upper town. Mid-13th century, Albufeira was recaptured by the Order of Knights of Santiago under Afonso III of the Moors.  After that, it was for many centuries an insignificant fishing village. The huge Lisbon earthquake in 1755, devastated large parts of the country, and Albufeira was particularly affected. The subsequent tsunami flooded the lower part of the village. This destroyed any significant monuments.\n\nIn the last quarter of the 20th century, Albufeira's fortunes were revived. Its discovery as the main tourist destination of the Algarve marked a huge expansion from fishing village, to town, to city. Today, the hotels and resorts extend almost seamlessly along the beautiful Albufeira coastline. In the summer months up to 300,000 holidaymakers join the usual 22,000 residents.\n\n==Get in==\n===By train===\n\n* \n\nTrains from Lagos and Faro take about 1 hr each (for €2-3). The train from Lisbon takes 3–4 hr. There is now a rapid train that takes 2½ hr, but with more limited runs.\n\n===By bus===\n*  across the street near the round about.&lt;br /&gt;Local buses to the center go from here, e.g. take the Azul line. Here also you will have to interchange coming by bus from the train station.\n}}\n\nFor buses from and to local nearby towns and cities, checkout [http://eva-bus.com/horarios.php the timetables of the local transport company '''Eva Bus'''].\n\n===By plane===\n'''Faro Airport''' () is also the main entrance to get in the Algarve through many low cost airline companies, and there is a large choice of airport transfers carrier companies that can provide private, shared or public ground transportation to Albufeira or any major place in the Algarve.\n\n==Get around==\n\n\n\nThere are local buses that run throughout town&amp;mdash;ask your ho(s)tel for a timetable.\n\nTaxis are available and can usually be found in the city centre.\n\n===By car===\nCar rental facilities are found in the city centre and include major international chains (Hertz, Europcar) and local ones. Even for the expert driver, getting around can be quite challenging in Albufeira as there are no street signs to navigate you through the maze-like structure of the endless roundabouts, making maps similarly difficult to interpret. Coupled with the high cost of car rentals, taxis or buses may be simpler modes of transportation.\n\n==See==\n\n\n\n* \n* \n\n==Do==\n\nMore than 25 superb beaches, many of them recognised for their quality with the distinguished Blue Flag by FEE, entice holidaymakers to swim and walk. The long sandy beaches Praia dos Pescadores, Praia do Tunel and Praia do Inatel stretching for miles in front of the old town offer a variety of water sports including parasailing, jet-skiing, and kayaking.Smaller sandy beaches sheltered by rocky bays with bizarre sandstone cliffs extend to both sides.\n\nThe marina was opened in 2003 in an artificial basin on the western edge of the city, with a capacity to moor nearly 500 boats.\n\nAlufeira can offer many varieties of culture, entertainment and family fun.\n* \n\n==Buy==\n* \n\n* \n\n* The narrow streets of the lower old town are filled with shops and street vendors that offer souvenirs and beach accessories. In the summer months, it is worth taking a stroll through the pedestrian zone with its pubs, bars and restaurants to drink into the special atmosphere of this bustling city.\n\n==Eat==\nThere are many restaurants to choose from, with many of them offering traditional Portuguese fare as well as a wide variety of fresh seafood. Dishes involving different preparations of codfish are plentiful, and the Cataplana styled dishes are well known in this region. Shellfish such as prawns, lobster, and crab tend to be very expensive, while fish is much more affordable. For a break from seafood, try the chicken piri-piri (roasted chicken with a sort of spicey sauce).\n\n===Budget===\n\n\n====In the Old Town====\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n====Along The Strip Albufeira====\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n====In or at the Belavista shopping centre====\n\n* \n* \n\n===Mid-range===\n\n* \n\n===Splurge===\n\n*\n\n==Drink==\n\nNightclubs, cafes and snack bars are abundant in the Old Town and on the Avenida Sa Caneiro, called ''The Strip'', the best known nightlife destination in the entire Algarve, especially popular with tourists from UK and Ireland. If you are looking for drunk people, loud music and cheap drinks, this is where you have to head. Everything is a bit more expensive in the discos at night, so many holiday makers will drink in the bars and go to the disco after 01:00&amp;mdash;they are open until 06:00 in the summer!\n\n==Sleep==\nHolidaymakers have the choice of more than 500 different accommodations in Albufeira and the surrounding area. Many of these hotels and resorts stretch along the coast between Vilamoura and Albufeira on the beaches of Inatel, Praia da Oura, Santa Eulalia, Olhos de Água and Falésia. West of Albufeira, between the marina of Albufeira and the tourist centre of Armação de Pêra many more hotels and resorts sit on top of the cliffs, overlooking small rocky bays and the beautiful sandy beaches of São Rafael, Castelo and Galé. If you prefer to stay closer to the picturesque old town of Albufeira to enjoy the vibrant atmosphere in the narrow lanes or to experience the night life on the famous “Strip”, you will find many hotels and apartments along the ring road Av. dos Descobrimentos, encircling the city centre, offering beautiful panoramic views towards the marvellous bay of Albufeira.\n\n===Mid-range===\n\n* \n| content=This hotel in Albufeira offers rooms equipped with cable TV, air conditioning and kitchenette.

                    "text": "\n'''Albuquerque''' is a vibrant, sprawling city near the Central New Mexico|center of New Mexico. Cradled in the Rio Grande Valley beneath the Sandia Mountains, it is by far the largest city in the state, acting as the media, educational, and economic center of New Mexico, as well as the home of the state's only major airport, making it a common entry point into New Mexico. Despite this, Albuquerque is often overshadowed as a tourist destination by Santa Fe (New Mexico)|Santa Fe,  to the north.\n\nBut any visit to New Mexico would be incomplete without taking in what Albuquerque has to offer, as New Mexico's only major city has pleasant scenery, colorful history, and a wealth of great attractions in its own right. Here, in a setting that has been made familiar to many by the television series ''Breaking Bad Tour|Breaking Bad'', you'll find many excellent museums, colorful neon signs along old Route 66, the naturalistic beauty of the Rio Grande and the Sandia Mountains, and a spectacular hot-air balloon festival in the fall.\n\n==Understand==\n\n===History===\nAlbuquerque was founded in 1706 as a small Spanish settlement on the banks of the Rio Grande and was named for the Duke of Alburquerque (hence Albuquerque's nickname, \"The Duke City\"). In the 1880s the railroad came to town, and almost overnight a new city grew up around the train tracks a couple of miles away from the original settlement. This \"New Town\" became the hub of commerce for the state, and the city grew exponentially (eventually the \"New Town\", which today is Downtown, and the original \"Old Town\" settlement were joined to become part of the same city).\n\nIn the 1920s the federal government designated a series of highways that ran from Chicago to Los Angeles as Route 66, and Albuquerque was one of the towns \"The Mother Road\" passed through. Starting in the 1950s, Albuquerque grew exponentially given federal investment in the local military bases and a massive influx of visitors and new residents, and for the most part it hasn't slowed down. Today, Albuquerque is still the hub of commerce and transportation in the state. While Santa Fe is the state capital and the principal tourist destination of New Mexico, Albuquerque is the state's only truly urban area, with a city population of over 500,000 and a metropolitan population of nearly a million people. This is where you'll find the headquarters of the state's businesses, the University of New Mexico, and the Albuquerque International Sunport, the only major airport in the state.\n\n===Climate===\n &amp;#160;&amp;#160; Data from [http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/normals NOAA (1981–2010)]\n}}\nAlbuquerque is in the high semi-desert [35.11N −106.64W (Elev. 4989&amp;nbsp;ft/1521&amp;nbsp;m)] and has a generally warm, dry climate with four distinct seasons. Spring is sunny and windy, although temperatures at night can be unexpectedly cool. Summers are hot (highs average 90–95°F/34°C, and temperatures near 100°F/38°C are not rare) and still mainly dry, but monsoonal conditions develop in July or August and produce furious if short-lived thunderstorms. Have rainwear available in the summer, although you won't use it most days. Fall is delightful, with comfortable temperatures and a return to generally dry conditions. Winter can be blustery, with overnight lows below freezing, but subzero temperatures are rare. One winter-weather issue for the traveler: snow, while infrequent and short-lived, does occur, and its relative rarity means that local drivers don't deal with it well. If you happen to be in town for a snowstorm, expect road chaos far out of proportion to the amount of snow that falls.\n\n===People===\nAlbuquerque's demographics are reflective of New Mexico as a whole. While Albuquerque does have a large non-native population, the city's makeup is predominantly white and/or Hispanic, with a significant population of Native Americans. These groups are spread throughout the city, but the largest concentrations of Hispanics are found in the South Valley (along the river on the south side of town) and in the Southeast Heights near Kirtland Air Force Base. The Southeast Heights is where you'll also find a large foreign-born population, with significant groups of Vietnamese, Taiwanese, Central American, African, and Middle Eastern descent.\n\nAlbuquerque is a casual town: expect shorts, a T-shirt, and sandals to be entirely acceptable almost everywhere. It's also a very humble city, with something of a self-deprecating vibe; you may hear a local remark on how backwards and small it is compared to larger Western cities, though this frequently gets rebuked with a passion from locals who adore their home. Either way, people here tend to be extremely friendly and exhibit very little pretension.\n\n===Visitor information===\n* \n\n==Get in==\n\n===By car===\nTwo interstate highways pass through: I-40 goes east–west and I-25 goes north–south. Where they meet is a large intersection called \"The Big I\". Albuquerque's Central Ave. is part of old Route 66.  A minor note of caution: I-25 south of the city is a \"safety corridor\" in which state law mandates higher fines for traffic violations.  Enforcement is spotty, but take the speed limits seriously anyway.\n\n===By plane===\n* | url=http://www.cabq.gov/airport/ | email=\n| address= | lat=35.04923 | long=-106.61675 | directions=\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\n| hours= | price=\n| wikipedia=Albuquerque International Sunport | image=AlbuquerqueSunportentrance.JPG | wikidata=Q1578972\n| content=The major air hub for all of New Mexico. Alaska, Allegiant, American, Delta, JetBlue, and United serve the Sunport with limited service from their respective major hubs, but it's Southwest Airlines that operates most traffic into ABQ, with direct service from most western cities and from some of Southwest's hubs in the Midwest and eastern United States.\n}}\n\nOne tip: If you're prone to airsickness, try to get flights into this airport that arrive either before noon or after sundown, particularly during late spring and early summer. The high elevation, hot sun, and spring winds combine to produce thermals that can make afternoon arrivals an extremely bumpy proposition. There are no major safety issues (the airport's runways are long, owing to the adjacent Air Force base, with no nearby obstacles to run into), but try telling your stomach that! The rough ride is less of a problem with outbound flights.\n\nIncidentally, this airport has a number of attractive displays of New Mexican arts and crafts, and is a more pleasant place than most airports to kill time while waiting for a flight. The Sunport also has charging stations for electronics and free wireless internet access. The major car rental companies are nearby, with a shuttle from the airport to the large rental center. The airport is served by a number of [https://abqsunport.com/getting-around/ground-transportation/ shuttle services] and by local bus #50 on the lower level at the west end of the shuttle island.\n\n===By train===\n\nAlbuquerque is a layover stop along '''Rail travel in the United States|Amtrak's''' ''[http://www.amtrak.com/southwest-chief-train Southwest Chief]'' daily train route. The station is at the , in downtown at 320 First St SW (in the same building as the Greyhound depot). The westbound train to Los Angeles is scheduled to arrive at 3:55PM and departs at 4:45PM. The eastbound train to Chicago arrives at 11:42AM and departs at 12:10PM. The station has a small cafeteria.\n\nA commuter rail line, the '''[http://www.nmrailrunner.com New Mexico Rail Runner Express]''', connects Albuquerque to Santa Fe and to the smaller communities north and south along the Rio Grande, including Belen, Los Lunas, and Bernalillo to Belen as its southern terminus. The main station is at the Alvarado Transportation Center in Downtown, which has regular bus connections along Central Avenue and to the airport. The Rail Runner runs daily, although service can be limited outside the weekday rush hour periods. Fares are based on how far you ride; a day pass will usually be in the range of $4–10. Tickets can be purchased online or from ticket agents on the train.\n\n===By bus===\nAlbuquerque has a fine bus depot at the  in downtown, 320 First St SW, which is served by '''[http://www.greyhound.com Greyhound]''' , and '''[http://www.autobusesamericanos.com.mx/joomla/ Autobuses Americanos]''' which provides bus service to many points in Mexico. The depot has a small cafeteria.\n\n==Get around==\n\n\nAlbuquerque is a heavily planned city.  In much of the city, the major roads are lined primarily with businesses with residential mazes on the insides. The city is divided into four quadrants, with street addresses taking the form \"12345 Main St. (NE/NW/SE/SW)\" in which the NE/NW/SE/SW suffix denotes the quadrant of the city containing the address. The railroad tracks, which run parallel to I-25, are the east–west dividing line, and Central Ave. is the north–south dividing line. Thus, the street address 3600 Menaul NE would be north of Central and east of the railroad tracks. This nomenclature, while useful in helping you with maps and directions, has the drawback that you can't tell whether a street runs north–south or east–west simply by looking at the address.\n\nBy and large it's difficult to get truly lost in Albuquerque, thanks in large part to the looming presence of the Sandia Mountains to the east. If you can also remember that I-25 runs north–south, I-40 runs east–west, and the Rio Grande runs along the bottom of the valley in the western part of the city, you should be able to make your way around the city without too many problems. Here are some basic terms that will come in handy when asking for directions or looking at a map:\n\n* '''Central Avenue''' is a principal east–west artery, running roughly parallel to I-40 and through '''Downtown''' just west of I-25 and past the '''University of New Mexico''' (UNM for short) just east of I-25.\n* The '''Heights''' are the eastern part of town closest to the Sandia Mountains. You may also hear reference to the '''Foothills''', which are the most extreme eastern part of the city, right at the base of the mountains.\n* '''Uptown''' is a business and shopping district in the Heights at I-40 and Louisiana Blvd.\n* The '''North Valley''' and '''Los Ranchos de Albuquerque''' (which is a separate municipality from Albuquerque) encompass the area north of I-40 between I-25 and the river.\n* The '''South Valley''' is the area south of Central Avenue west of I-25.\n* The '''Westside''' is all the suburban neighborhoods on the western side of the river. '''Rio Rancho''', a separate community from Albuquerque, is the metro area's largest suburb and can be considered a northern extension of the Westside. Sandwiched between Albuquerque and Rio Rancho is the village of '''Corrales''', which sits adjacent to the river and has a more rural feel, with a single narrow roadway through town lined with picturesque adobe buildings, many of them containing locally owned shops.\n\n===By car===\nIf you're driving, be prepared for frequent road construction.  The city government web site gives [http://www.cabq.gov/construction/traffic-reports information on major construction projects], but there are always minor ones going on. Several radio stations try to give traffic reports during morning and afternoon rush hours, but the service tends to come and go, and it's best to inquire locally as to which stations are offering it.  KKOB-AM, 770 on the dial, seems to be fairly reliable for these reports. The interchange of I-40 and I-25 is commonly called \"The Big I\", and you will hear it referred to as such in traffic reports. Traffic congestion, while not nearly as horrible as some of the other cities in the Western U.S., can still get bad during the rush hour and on Saturdays. The two interstates and the river crossings usually have the worst congestion.\n\nMany Albuquerqueans seem to consider I-40 and 25, which run through the city, to be their own personal expressways. The lack of turn signal usage is a running joke for most Albuquerque drivers, so watch for cars changing lanes without warning. However, Interstate traffic usually flows around the pace of the speed limit.\n\nDriving while talking on your cell phone is illegal in Albuquerque unless you use a hands-free system.\n\n===By bus===\n'''[http://www.cabq.gov/transit/ ABQ Ride]''', , is Albuquerque's public transit system. Despite some strides in the development of its public transit system, Albuquerque is still primarily a driving city, so with the exception of Central Avenue public transit is still for the most part very underdeveloped. Most of ABQ Ride's routes spur out of the Alvarado Transportation Center in Downtown at Central Avenue &amp; First Street, which also serves as Albuquerque's Amtrak station and Greyhound depot as well as a Rail Runner station. Bus service is reduced during the weekend.\n\nThe '''ART''' (formerly '''Rapid Ride''') is an express bus service operated by ABQ Ride which runs frequently, utilizing bright red articulated buses. There are three routes: the #766 (Red Line) and #777 (Green Line) each run very frequently and almost entirely on Central Avenue, serving attractions such as the BioPark, Old Town, Downtown, UNM, Nob Hill, the fairgrounds, and Uptown; the #766 runs between Uptown and Unser/Central on the Westside, while the #777 runs between Downtown and Tramway/Central on the eastern edge of the city. Additionally, the #790 (Blue Line) connects UNM to the Cottonwood Mall area on the Westside, but runs less frequently than the Central Avenue lines and is geared more towards commuters. Local routes that are useful for visitors include the #50, which runs Monday–Saturday between the airport and Downtown; and #40 (the \"D-Ride\"), a free shuttle which circulates around Downtown on the weekdays.\n\nFor visitor access to the Sun Van paratransit service, call  or  at least two business days in advance.\n\nAll travel on ABQ Ride is free.\n\n===By bike===\nAlbuquerque is fairly bikeable, but it's a sprawling Western city and things are spread out. It's hillier than it looks; Old Town and Downtown attractions are several hundred feet lower than things in the heights on the eastern side of the city; plan accordingly. Getting around by bike can be a mixed bag in Albuquerque: street cycling can be risky as drivers may not always be aware and most major streets lack bicycle lanes (and even those that do have lanes may require uncomfortably close proximity to fast traffic). On the other hand, Albuquerque has a very proactive cycling community and a splendid paved trail network which is undergoing an expansion phase.\n\nThe crown jewel in this network is the '''Paseo del Bosque Trail''', which runs along the east side of the Rio Grande and offers lovely riverside scenery.  Another backbone to the trail network is the '''North Diversion Channel Trail''' which runs from UNM north to Balloon Fiesta Park, and while not nearly as scenic as the Bosque trail (it runs along a concrete drainage channel and past some industry) it offers the occasional grand vista of the city. Another fun ride is the paved trail along '''Tramway Boulevard''' on the eastern edge of the city, which offers excellent views of the city and access to the foothills of the Sandia Mountains. You can find a complete bike map of all the trails, lanes, and recommended routes on [http://www.cabq.gov/bike/ the city's bicycling website].\n\n===By horse===\nA principal corridor for equestrian use is the '''Paseo del Bosque Trail'''.  Trailhead parking lots are large and one, at the Los Ranchos de Albuquerque|Los Ranchos open space in the North Valley, has a feed store, .\n\n==See==\n\n* \n** \n** \n** \n* \n* \n* \n* \n*  Sandia Peak east of the city, and is one of the longest and most spectacular aerial tramways in the world. The first upward tram departs at 9AM (except Tu in the off season), and service continues until early evening. The 15-min ride to the top is incredible, bringing you right up to the rocky face of the Sandias. The view of the city from Sandia Peak is tremendous (especially after sunset), and there is a visitor center at the top. Closed for two weeks in spring and fall for \"maintenance,\" but spring winds are so intense that you really don't want to be on an aerial tram then anyway.\n}}\n* \n\n* \n===Old Town===\n\nThe Old Town is east of Rio Grande Boulevard in between Central Ave. and Mountain Rd. (''west of downtown'').\n\nA nice sightseeing area, Old Town is where the city was founded in 1706 and is a place where centuries of history and modern life merge; 18th century architecture with narrow brick paths is blended with adobe architecture, and there are lots of little nooks and crannies, small restaurants, and specialty shops. At the center of the district is the pleasant , which has a gazebo, historic exhibits, and is bordered on the north by the , the oldest building in Albuquerque. In Christmas time, thousands of ''luminarias'' (paper bags filled with sand and illuminated from within by a lit candle) line the streets. Guided tours of Old Town are available from a [https://www.abqtours.fun/ private operator] or from the [https://www.cabq.gov/culturalservices/albuquerque-museum/albuquerque-museum-tours Albuquerque Museum].\n\nThere are several museums within easy walking distance of the Old Town Plaza. Most of them are on Mountain Rd., just a few blocks northeast of the Plaza.\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===University of New Mexico===\n\n\n\nBy far the largest institution of higher education in the state, UNM has a significant presence in the center of the city. The main campus makes a very pleasant diversion, with its Pueblo-Revival adobe buildings and pleasant landscaping. Near the center of the campus is a , a popular relaxing spot for students where you can rest on the lawns and feed the birds.\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n===Itineraries===\n* '''Breaking Bad Tour|''Breaking Bad'' Tour''' – A tour of filming locations from Albuquerque's main claim to fame: the popular television series ''Breaking Bad'', which was set and produced almost exclusively in Albuquerque. This itinerary contains most of the filming locations for the show as well as some local businesses selling show-inspired products.\n\n==Do==\n\n===Outdoors===\n* \n* \n* \n** \n** \n\n* The '''Sandia Mountains''' offer outdoors opportunities ranging from straight hiking (the La Luz trail is popular, perhaps too much so) on to serious, multi-day rock climbing. Mountain biking is also really popular, and there are great trails in the foothills as well as at a ski area on the other side of the mountains during the summer. If less athletically inclined, ride the Sandia Peak Tramway (see \"See\" section above) to the top. At the base of the mountains, near the tramway, you can find magnificent views of the city and mountains and access trails into the mountains, especially around the . For a map of Sandia Mountain trails, see [http://www.fs.usda.gov/cibola the Cibola National Forest website]. During the winter, the [http://www.sandiapeak.com/ Sandia Peak Ski Area] serves skiers and snowboarders; see Cedar Crest for details. The ski area can be reached either by taking a 45&amp;nbsp;min. drive around the mountain to the base lodge or by taking the tramway up to the top of the mountain—presuming there's enough snow at the top (skiers get a discount on tramway tickets, but you have to bring your own equipment).\n\n===Sports and amusements===\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Performing arts===\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta===\n west of I-25, take either Alameda Blvd or Tramway Blvd exit off I-25 | price=$10, children ages 12 and under free (''parking $15 per car'') | wikipedia=Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta | wikidata=Q4712821 | lastedit=2017-06-04 | content= }}\n\nThe Fiesta is the world's largest ballooning event and one of the most photographed events in the world. A cultural landmark for Albuquerque (and indeed, all of New Mexico), this festival gives you a first-hand look at the world of ballooning. For nine days in October, you can walk out onto a large field where balloonists from around the world set up, inflate, launch, and possibly land their balloons. Mass ascensions of balloons with hundreds of different colors and shapes create an often stunning and magnificent sight. It's one of the most heavily attended festivals in the entire U.S.\n\nBalloons fly best in cooler conditions, so many of the events take place early in the morning. Traffic is pretty bad around the festival; expect a long, long line of cars (you may want to seriously consider taking park-and-ride to beat the traffic). Get your hotel reservations '''''far''''' in advance, because everyone fills up around this time of year.\n\nIf the event is rained or snowed out, there are no refunds on prices. Most years the weather works in favor of the balloonists, so this shouldn't be a problem, though.\n\n\nThe event begins on the first Saturday of October and ends with a farewell mass ascension on the Sunday of the following weekend, with numerous events in-between, such as concerts and balloon races. Here are a few of the highlights of the fiesta:\n\n* '''Dawn Patrol'''. Every day there's a Dawn Patrol at around 6AM, where a few balloons take off before the sun rises. These balloons test the conditions before other balloons take off.\n* '''Mass Ascension'''. On weekend days at about 7AM the Mass Ascension occurs, which is the lift off of all the balloons participating in the fiesta, usually in two waves. Not to be missed.\n* '''Balloon Glow'''. On weekend evenings (except for the final day of the event) a Balloon Glow takes place, when the balloons don't lift off the ground, but are illuminated by the light of their propane burners going off.\n* '''Morning Glow'''. The same as the balloon glow but early in the morning (may not always occur).\n* '''Special Shapes Rodeo'''. Happens at 7AM on the Thursday and Friday of the event, which is a Mass Ascension for all the \"special shape\" balloons. There are also Balloon Glows called Glowdeos (a portmanteau of \"glow\" and \"rodeo\") for the special shape balloons. The special shapes are the balloons in forms other than the standard balloon shape, and are very popular with kids; expect to see animals, cartoon characters, clowns, and many other colorful creations. Returning favorites include a milk cow, a wagon coach, and a trio of bees.\n\nAnd if you want to do more than watch the balloons, there are several local companies which provide balloon rides year-round:\n* \n\n===Other annual events===\n\nBesides the Balloon Fiesta, there are numerous festivals and celebrations on a yearly basis. Here are some of the major ones:\n\n* \n* \n* \n* Around '''Christmas''' time, thousands of '''luminarias''' (a paper bag half-filled with sand with a lit candle placed inside) line the streets of Old Town. If you come to the city during this time of year you are also likely to see electric luminarias (a string of lights designed to resemble authentic luminarias) lining the roofs of many buildings in the city. You may also see luminaria displays in some of the city's residential neighborhoods, on the UNM campus, and on many an individual's front yard, but Old Town provides the most accessible and dramatic display.\n\n==Buy==\n\nUpon first glance, it might seem like your only place to shop are the miles and miles of strip malls that line the major arterials. While that's not ''entirely'' the case, everything is really spread out, with the exception of the concentrated Old Town-Downtown-Nob Hill area along Central Ave. So while you can find just about anything you're looking for, you will probably have to drive a ways to get it.\n\nHere are some good places around town to shop:\n\n* \n** \n** \n** \n** \n** \n** \n** \n* \n** \n** \n** \n* \n** \n** \n* \n* \n* \n\nOutside these areas, there are also some specific businesses around town that are worth your time:\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Eat==\n\nDining out in Albuquerque tends to be relatively inexpensive and very casual. Many places offer outdoor seating. Iced tea is the beverage of choice.\n\n===New Mexican dining===\nNew Mexican cuisine is unique. Be ready for the question \"Red or green?\" or in Spanish \"¿Rojo o verde?\" which refers to the chile-based sauce included in or used to smother various menu items. There are constant arguments as to which is hotter, the ripe and often dried red chile, or the immature green chile; however, spiciness depends much more on the strain of pepper and how the chile is prepared rather than the color, and varies greatly by restaurant, so inquire and experiment. Many meals will include ''sopaipillas'', the characteristic New Mexican fry bread, as a side. The characteristic desserts are ''flan'', a type of custard, or ''Natillas'', closer in texture to pudding.\n\n====Budget====\n* \n** \n** \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n** \n** \n* \n* \n* \n\n====Mid-range====\n* \n* \n* \n* \n** \n** \n\n===Non-New Mexican dining===\n\n* \n\n====Budget====\n* \n*  long chile-cheese dog with green sauce instead of traditional red.\n}}\n* \n* \n** \n** \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n** \n** \n* \n\n* \n\n====Mid-range====\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n====Splurge====\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Grocery stores===\n* \n:* \n:* \n* \n:* \n:* \n:* \n:* \n* \n* \n:* \n:* \n* \n:* \n:* \n* For your more typical chain groceries, '''[http://www.albertsons.com Albertsons]''' and '''[http://www.smithsfoodanddrug.com Smith's]''' each have several stores in the city.\n\n==Drink==\n====Downtown====\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n====Nob Hill &amp; UNM====\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n====North I-25 Corridor &amp; Heights====\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n====Westside====\n* \n* \n\n==Sleep==\n\n\nIf you want a nicer—and pricier—hotel, then head east on I-40 to \"uptown\" (in the northeast side of the city, which is at higher elevation than \"downtown\" close to the river) or north on I-25. If you don't mind less free stuff, Central Ave. (old Route 66) is cheaper. However, there are some real dives along Central Avenue, many with unsavory reputations and occasional police raids. Hotels around the airport are generally vanilla-flavored, business-traveler places, but at least are somewhat less expensive than airport hotels in many cities. There are a few nice highrise hotels in the Downtown/Old Town area.  Lodging Per Diem is $75.\n\nAlbuquerque is experiencing a massive wave of hotel building, mainly in the \"Mid-range\" class.  This apparently is driven in part by the infamous lodging shortages during the Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta in October.  The result is that during other parts of the year, affordable hotels shouldn't be too hard to find.  Even with the growth in the hotel market, lodging can be tight for the Fiesta, so if you're coming then, reserve well in advance—months rather than days.\n\nFor some free lodgings try looking for cafes where bands are playing (normally on the weekends) and ask among the punk kids and see if they'll help.  Even they, however, may not have much space during the Balloon Fiesta.\n\n===Budget===\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Mid-range===\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Splurge===\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n*  from downtown Albuquerque)\n| phone=+1 505 344-9297 | tollfree= | fax=+1 505 342-1302\n| checkin= | checkout= | price=$150–315\n| content=The inn and  grounds are beautiful, set near the Rio Grande bosque with conference and meeting facilities available.\n}}\n\n==Stay safe==\n\nAlbuquerque has an average crime rate compared to some other American cities, but most of it is property crime of more concern to residents than to visitors.\n\nCentral Avenue is home to some of Albuquerque's main attractions, but portions of it can be somewhat dangerous after dark. The section from the train tracks (eastern edge of downtown) to University Blvd. can be a little scary in the evening.  Even in Downtown, while Central Avenue is passable, smaller nearby streets such as Copper Street can be scary after dark. The Nob Hill/UNM district (between University and Carlisle) is perfectly safe at night, but Central gets progressively seedier east of Carlisle, and can get quite scary around the Fairgrounds. Consider the bus or a cab through these areas after the sun goes down.\n\nDue to its size and mild climate, the streets of Albuquerque are considered home to many people. While not typically a danger, do expect to meet up with beggars and vagrants, particularly around UNM.\n\nIf you're going to be engaging in outdoor recreation (even as laid-back as watching an Isotopes day game), slather on the sun screen.  The elevation of the city is  or higher, and there is usually not much cloud cover, so one can get a bad sunburn in surprisingly short order.\n\nAlso, New Mexico is very arid.  That, and its high altitude results in very low humidity in both summer and winter, which can lead to dehydration.  Drink plenty of water. A common complaint among visitors from lower altitudes is a persistent headache, which is often mistaken for altitude sickness, but is really a common symptom of dehydration. Consider carrying a water bottle and drinking frequently throughout the day if you don't already.\n\nBe forewarned about New Mexican cuisine; if you're not used to green chile, go easy at first.  Many first-timers have tried to eat the hottest chile they could find, only to discover six hours later that it was ''much'' hotter than they remembered.  Be prepared.\n\n==Connect==\nThe area code for the city is '''505'''.\n\nEvery branch of the '''[https://abq.ent.sirsi.net/client/en_US/default Albuquerque/Bernalillo County Library System]''' provides free wifi; they also have computers available but these require that you purchase an internet access card for $3.

There are also a number of [http://www.cabq.gov/wifi/#map free wi-fi hot spots provided by the city], mainly around Civic Plaza in Downtown, the Sunport, and the Old Town Plaza. Also, it is free to connect to the guest wifi on the UNM campus.  Generally, there aren't very many wireless cafes in the city, but there is a good concentration around the UNM/Nob Hill area. The local Flying Star Cafe and '''[http://www.satcoffee.com/ Satellite Coffee]''' locations offer free wireless internet to customers.\n\n===Newspapers===\n* The '''''[http://www.abqjournal.com/ Albuquerque Journal]''''' ($0.50 daily, $1.50 Sundays) is the state's largest newspaper and talks about issues in the metro area, the state, and the world.\n* The '''''[http://www.alibi.com/ Alibi]''''' (free Wednesday mornings) is a free weekly that discusses issues in the metro area and runs some columns, but is more focused on the arts scene and has some great movie and restaurant reviews.

This includes bars and restaurants; the only exceptions are casinos and cigar bars. In addition, Albuquerque has banned smoking on all public property except the golf courses.\n\n===Consulates===\n*  \n\n==Go next==\n\n\n'''North of Albuquerque:'''\n* '''Santa Fe (New Mexico)|Santa Fe''', one of the world's great travel destinations, is about  to the north.  The direct route is via I-25, but if you have time and the weather forecast is good, consider taking instead the \"Turquoise Trail\" (NM SR 14) on the east side of the Sandia Mountains. If you'd rather not drive, you can also take the Rail Runner commuter train straight into the heart of the city.\n* If taking the Turquoise Trail, stop at '''Madrid (New Mexico)|Madrid''', an artist community along the way.  There's a small selection of galleries, a glass blower and decent tavern for lunch. Another attraction on the route is the '''Tinkertown Museum''' near Cedar Crest, which contains a large collection of wood carvings and Americana.\n* '''Bernalillo''' is  north on I-25 and is connected via the Rail Runner commuter train.  The '''[https://nmhistoricsites.org/coronado Coronado State Monument]''' is a notable attraction, as well as the Santa Ana Pueblo's casino and golf course, which are right next to Bernalillo.\n* There are several Native American '''New Mexico Pueblos|pueblos''' between Albuquerque and Santa Fe just off I-25. Some of them offers attractions and a chance to explore the area. If you have a few hours to kill, consider a detour to Cochiti Pueblo and the '''[https://www.blm.gov/visit/kktr Kasha–Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument]'''. This little known monument, open for day use ($5/vehicle), contains some gorgeous natural scenery and geologic formations, such as a narrow slot canyon you can hike through. To get there, get off at the Santo Domingo Pueblo exit (Exit 259) and follow the signs up SR 22 and onto a gravel road to the monument.\n* The pretty '''Jemez Mountains''' offer pleasant hiking and fishing in the summer and can be good for skiing and snowshoeing in the winter, although snowpack varies greatly from year to year and may be insufficient for winter sports. Take I-25 north to Bernalillo, then US 550 to San Ysidro, where NM 4 (502 on some maps) takes off through the astonishing red rock of San Diego Canyon and into the Jemez.\n* '''Los Alamos''' and '''Bandelier National Monument''' are also to the north, and about as distant from Albuquerque via the Jemez route as via the Santa Fe route.\n* Beyond Santa Fe lies the beauty and cultural color of '''North Central New Mexico|north central New Mexico'''—Taos, Sangre de Cristo Mountains, etc.\n\n'''South of Albuquerque:'''\n* '''Isleta Pueblo''', off of I-25 just south of the city, is a small Native American village with the St. Augustine Church, a large white mission and one of the oldest in the nation.

                    "text": "\n'''Albury-Wodonga''' is a twin city straddling the Murray River border of the two south-eastern Australian states of New South Wales and Victoria (state)|Victoria. Albury is the city on the New South Wales bank of the river, Wodonga the Victorian city on the southern bank. For all practical purposes related to travel, the two cities are one.  The cities are a gateway to the gourmet area surrounding Beechworth, the mountain town of Bright and the Rutherglen winery area.  They also make a good stopping-off point on the drive between Melbourne and Sydney.\n\n==Understand==\n\nWhilst in many senses Albury-Wodonga operates as a single community (sometimes to the dismay of residents), the twin cities possess parallel municipal governments and state government services. The closer proximity of Melbourne and the local predominance of Australian rules football perhaps give Albury a closer cultural affiliation with Victoria.\n\nGrand plans were made by the Gough Whitlam government in the 1970s to turn Albury-Wodonga into a major inland city and the cities have grown rapidly from sleepy country towns to major regional centres.\n\nThe Albury-Wodonga Visitor Information Centre is on Lincoln Causeway (on what was once the Hume Highway) between the two cities. It is open 9AM-5PM daily.\n\n=== History ===\n\nThe ''Wiradjuri'' people were probably the group of Indigenous Australians resident immediately before the advent of Europeans in the area in the 1820s-1830s. European settlement was first gazetted at this popular river crossing in 1839 and after a decade a small settlement was well established.\n\n1851 saw the separation of Victoria from New South Wales as a separate colony with the Murray marking much of the border, and Albury and Wodonga developed as a border town, with customs points between a protectionist Victoria and a free trade favouring New South Wales.\n\nA permanent bridge was built over the Murray river in 1860, with horse-drawn coach connections running between the train stations in Wodonga and New South Wales, each running trains on different railway gauges.  Even after the rail bridge was built, trains from Victoria ran to Albury, and trains from New South Wales ran to Wodonga, as the governments could not agree on a common interchange station.\n\nAlbury eventually emerged as the choice for interchange, but the railway gauges remained incompatible until the 1960s when the standard gauge track was laid to Melbourne allowing the first trains to run from Sydney to Melbourne without a change in Albury.  The size of Albury station still reflects this heritage.\n\nAlbury was also the focus of attempts to open up the inland trade along the Murray, with paddlesteamers seen as a technology that would open up large tracts of farmland to the market.  Although strongly supported by the South Australian government the paddlesteamers were never really a financial success, but the wharves and paddlesteamers in Albury today are at least a tribute to the tenacity of the steamer pioneers.\n\n==Get in==\n through Albury]]\n===By plane===\n*  | url=http://www.flyalbury.com.au | email=\n| address= | lat=-36.067778 | long=146.958055 | directions=\n| phone= | tollfree=\n| hours= | price=\n| wikidata=Q17440\n|lastedit=2023-09-02| content=Is served by: [http://www.rex.com.au/ Rex Airlines] flying from Sydney and Melbourne; [http://www.qantas.com.au/ Qantas] flying from Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.

Although the standard gauge line was extended to Melbourne to allow direct services in the 1960s, the intermediate stations (such as Wodonga), Wangaratta, etc., were only serviced by the Victorian trains.  The Sydney to Melbourne trains would run express from Albury to Melbourne.  In 2012 the standard gauge line was completed for the intermediate stations, meaning that the Sydney to Melbourne trains now stop at Wodonga.  However, as part of the reconstruction, the Wodonga station was moved around 5&amp;nbsp;km from the Wodonga town centre.  Albury station remains easily accessible to the Albury town centre.\n\n\n\n\n\n* [https://transportnsw.info/regional NSW TrainLink] run two services a day in each direction between Sydney and Melbourne.  These trains stop only at Albury station.\n* [http://ptv.vic.gov.au/route/view/1706 V/Line] run three trains a day in each direction from Southern Cross Station in Melbourne. On weekdays they run an additional coach service connecting with the Melbourne train to and from Seymour.  The coach service stops in the centre of town in Wodonga, away from the railway station. All V/Line trains stop at Wodonga and terminate in Albury.\nIf you do wish to take the train into Albury, however, it is recommended that you take the V/Line service from Melbourne, as it costs just $9.20 for an adult whereas from Sydney the cost is $92, a whopping 10 times the price.\n\n=== By bus ===\nV/Line operates daily buses from Albury to and from\n\nCanberra (4 hours)\n\nAdelaide (13 hours)\n\nKerang (6 hours)\n\n==Get around==\n\nIn typical Australian fashion, the lack of cooperation between states has resulted in the lack of proper signage as both states don't really put the other state's city, making navigation quite difficult. However, within each city, signage to the respective CBD is well-signed, but it's still easy to get lost. Nevertheless, locals are almost always willing to help you.\n\n'''By bus'''\n\nBoth Albury and Wodonga have extensive bus networks. There is also a bus that connects the two cities' CBDs that departs every 30 minutes.\n\n==See==\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Do==\n* \n* \n*\n*\n*\n\n==Buy==\nBoth Albury and Wodonga have many large department stores to cater to their growing population.

                    "text": "\n\n'''Alcalá de los Gazules''' is a town of 5,200 people (2018) in Cadiz (province)|Cadiz. It has a uniform cityscape that is a protected monument. Alcalá lies in the mountainous hinterland of Andalusia close to the Los Alcornocales Natural Park, which is lined with cork oaks.\n==Understand ==\n===History ===\nRock paintings near the place testify to the early settlement of the area. In Roman times there was a settlement called Lascuta nearby, made famous by the \"Bronze of Lascuta\" from 189 BC that was found there. From the Visigothic period, traces are also preserved. After the conquest by the Moors, the place was named Qalat at Yazula (\"Castle of the Gazules\"), which refers to a family of the same name. In 1264 the village was conquered by Alfonso X el Sabio (the wise) and henceforth called \"Alcalá de los Gazules\".\n\nLater the village belonged to the Ribera family, the dukes of Alcalá, who were mainly responsible for the construction of the historical buildings that are still preserved today. The Moorish castle complex was blown up during the Spanish War of Independence (1808–1814). \n\n==Get in==\n\n\n\nAlcalá de los Gazules is 3&amp;nbsp;km from the A381 motorway between Jerez de la Frontera and Algeciras.  The nearest airports are at Jerez and Gibraltar, both less than an hour's drive away.  There are four buses a day from Seville, Jerez, Cadiz and Algeciras.  The nearest rail stations are at Jerez and Algeciras.\n\n==Get around==\nAlcalá de los Gazules is in the Alcornocales Natural Park, a vast area of woodland and rocky peaks that stretches across the eastern half of the province.  There are numerous nature trails through the park and details are available from any tourist information office in the province.\n\nWithin an hour's drive of the town are the windswept cliffs and golden sandy beaches of the Costa de la Luz, the Bahia de Cadiz Natural Park with its flamingos and many other wading birds, the historic British colonial outpost of Gibraltar, the ancient city of Cádiz, Jerez de la Frontera with its sherry bodegas and thoroughbred horses, and the glorious mountain scenery of the Sierra de Grazalema.\n\n==See==\n\nThe '''Parroquia de San Jorge''' (church) is well worth a visit even if you are not religious.  It feels untouched by time and contains many examples of historic symbolism - not least the great gilded statue of St George, the patron saint of the town, slaying his dragon.\n\nThere are numerous '''fairs and festivals''' throughout the year:\n*Carnaval (early March)&lt;br&gt;\n*St George's Day (23 April)&lt;br&gt;\n*Semana Santa (the week before Easter)&lt;br&gt;\n*Summer Feria (5 days in late August)&lt;br&gt;\n*Romeria de Nuestra Señora de los Santos (second week of September)\n\nFor further details see the town's [http://alcaladelosgazules.es/secciones/fiestas/ official website].\n\n==Do==\nIf you are into '''bird-watching''', come in April–May or September–October when millions of birds migrate between Europe and Africa. At any time of year you are likely see booted and Bonnelli's eagles, griffon vultures and lesser kestrels wheeling above the town.\n\n'''Horse-riding''' is available at the [http://caballoselalamo.com/UKindex.html Finca el Alamo] and at the campsite, [http://en.campinglosgazules.com/ Camping Los Gazules].\n\n'''Artists and photographers''' will find plenty to fire their imagination.  The long summer evenings are especially good for landscape photography.  A British-run residential art school, Painting in Spain,[http://www.paintinginspain.co.uk/] offers tailor-made courses for individuals or small groups.\n\nThere are plenty of resources for '''cyclists, hikers and climbers''' in the Alcornocales and in the various other Natural Parks in the Province of Cadiz.\n\nThere are excellent '''golf courses''' nearby including [http://www.fairplayresort.es/en/ Fairplay Golf Hotel] at Benalup-Casas Viejas (20&amp;nbsp;km away) and [http://arcosgolf.es/ Arcos Gardens] (40&amp;nbsp;km away).\n\n==Buy==\nThere are no tourist gift shops in Alcala.  However there are many little food shops where you can buy excellent locally-made produce: goats' or sheep's milk cheeses, honey, chorizos and delicious bread and cakes.  The cheese factory shop on the Poligono la Palmosa (behind the gas station) is worth a visit, as is the tiny Horno de Luna bakery in Callejon Bernadino, near the Mercado de Abastos (indoor food market).\n\n==Eat==\nThere are numerous restaurants catering for all pockets, and most of the bars will serve tapas at any time.  Lunch is the main meal of the day, served from around 13:30 until 15:30, and a \"menu del día\" will give you a three-course meal and a drink for less than €10.  Local specialities include game - wild boar or \"jabali\", venison, rabbit or partridge; hot gazpacho (soup thickened with breadcrumbs) and, in early June, tiny snails in broth (known as Caracoles). Fruit and vegetables are essentially seasonal; some, like wild asparagus or the fruits of the chumbo (prickly pear) are harvested from the countryside around the village.  Visit the market on Wednesday or Saturday mornings to stock up, or just admire the quality.\n\nYou are not in a paella &amp; sangria zone here!\n\n==Drink==\nPale sherry or \"fino\" is widely available and consumed in large quantities by the locals at festivals, often watered down with lemonade when it is known as \"rebujito\".  At the other end of the sherry scale is Pedro Ximenez, a very sweet, raisin-flavoured drink which is surprisingly good over ice.  Tinto de verano (red wine and lemonade or soda with ice and lemon) is a refreshing alternative to beer on a hot day.\n\n==Sleep==\n*Hotel La Palmosa, Área de Servicio La Palmosa (Ctra.

                    "text": "\nImage:Plaza de Cervantes, Alcalá de Henares, España (10).JPG|thumb|250px|Plaza de Cervantes.\n'''Alcalá de Henares''' is a city 30 km northeast of Madrid. Its attractive medieval centre, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is full of interesting old buildings. It's a university and religious centre, and famous people linked to the town include Miguel Cervantes (baptized and almost certainly born here), author of ''Don Quixote'', Cardinal Cisneros (refounder of the University of Alcalá, the current Complutense University of Madrid) and Katherine of Aragon (born here), first wife of England's King Henry VIII. Alcalá is easily visited as a day-trip from Madrid, and because it's so close to Madrid Barajas Airport it makes a good first or last night stop on a tour of northern Spain.\n\n==Understand==\n\nThere are two [https://www.turismoalcala.es/ tourist information centres]: one in Plaza de los Santos Niños (near the Cathedral) and another in Capilla del Oidor (the place with a tower in Plaza de Cervantes). \n\nAlcalá is placed in a flat field on the right side of Henares River, while the left side is a natural space with high hills. The historical centre is at 500 metres from the river, to avoid the frequent floods; however, the last overflow happened in the 1940s and new neighbourhoods have been built in the river banks since then. \n\nAlcalá de Henares goes back to a Roman settlement by the name of ''Complutum'' (hence the tendency to name stuff related to the town \"Complutense\" according to Latin grammar) while its current name goes back to a Muslim fortress (compare the word \"alcazar\" for former Muslim fortresses). Both the Roman and the Muslim settlement had their cores somewhat outside the modern urban core of present-day Alcalá. \n\nThe town has a strong connection to Cardinal Cisneros, the confessor of the \"Catholic Monarchs\" and perhaps the most powerful non-royal in the Spain of his era. His coat of arms contains swans (''cisne'' in Spanish) and they can be seen all through the town. Cardinal Cisneros is linked to the university, which he transformed into a proper university in 1499 (often given as the foundation date as the previous institution did not teach the full range of early modern university subjects). \n\nPrior to the Alhambra Edict, Alcalá had a large and prosperous Jewish and Muslim community. The edict was passed by the Catholic Monarchs on the urging of Cisneros. It banned Jews and Muslims from living in Spain. Today, buildings in the historic city centre are marked according to the part of town they belonged to. \n\nAlcalá de Henares was also the site of the baptism of Miguel de Cervantes, the best known author in the Spanish language. He was almost certainly also born here and a house that was linked to Cervantes in the 20th century is presented as his birth house. Although he and all his siblings for whom baptismal records survive were baptized here, there are those who doubt his birth occurred here, in part because his birth house is to be found in the Jewish quarter. Cervantes went by a second last name that was not that of his mother. (In Spain and Portugal people usually have two last names, the first from the father, the second from the mother.) Some argue that he did this to conceal possible Jewish ancestry. \n\nAnother famous son of the town was Manuel Azaña, the last President of the Second Spanish Republic. He resided just across the street from the \"Cervantes house\", although Azaña was not aware that Cervantes had lived there.\n\nThe University of Alcalá was moved to Madrid in the 19th century (hence the name \"Complutense\" of Spain's largest, most prestigious university) but a new university claiming the tradition of the old institution was founded in the 20th century.\n\nAlcalá has suffered a great deal during several Spanish wars, since it occupies a strategic position. The city was occupied by both sides of the conflict during the War of the Spanish Succession, the Peninsular War (in which the Napoleonic troops made the population suffer because of its support to guerrilla fighters) and the First Carlist War. The Civil War was especially tragic: the local military garrison sided with the rebels in the first days of the war, and the troops brought from Madrid to put down the rebellion also burned some churches; then during the war the city was repeatedly bombarded by the Luftwaffe at the orders of Franco, which killed many people and destroyed many buildings; after the war the Francoists imprisoned thousands of Republicans (including local poet Marcos Ana, whose father had died during a bombardment in the war) and killed hundreds of them; in 1947  an arsenal exploded by accident, but it was blamed on \"marxist terrorism\" and several people were shot. Given the anti-clerical tendencies of the Second Spanish Republic, it should not surprise that one of the churches has a blatantly pro-Franco inscription regarding the Civil War, but it might surprise you to hear that it is still there unaltered and not put into any context by additional plaques or the likes.\n\nIn the 1960s and 70s many factories were established and the population grew from 25,000 in 1960 to 140,000 in 1980, attracting many migrant workers from Castilla-La Mancha, Extremadura and Andalucía. Since the 1990s the city has become a magnet for foreigners and nowadays Romanians make up 10% of the population.\n\n==Get in==\n\n\n===By plane===\nMadrid Barajas airport is 15 km west, with extensive connections across Europe and beyond. Bus 824 runs between Alcalá and Terminals 1 &amp; 2 (via Torrejón de Ardoz), every 30-40 min weekdays and hourly at weekends from about 07:00 to 22:00, taking 40 min. These buses run between Barajas and central Alcalá (corner of Via Complutense and Calle Murillo); some of them continue to the University.\n\n\nAnother option to reach Alcalá from the airport by bus, if 824 is not available, is taking bus 200 from the airport in direction to Avenida de América and stop in Canillejas; once there, go to the bus stop on the other side of the road and take bus 223 to Alcalá (buses 229 and 227 also go to Alcalá, but not to the centre). If this sounds very complicated, you can just stay on bus 200 until the last stop in Avenida de América, which is a big bus station with clear signs, and once there take bus 223 (or 229 or 227) to Alcalá, it's easy since this is where those buses begin their journey.\n\nReaching the airport by metro &amp; suburban train involves going into Madrid and changing at Chamartin or Atocha to come out again.\n\nTo reach Alcalá by train from the airport, you must change trains in the stations of Chamartín, Nuevos Ministerios, Recoletos or Atocha. The easiest option is Recoletos since you don't have to change platform: just get out of your train and wait until the indicators say the next train is bound for Alcalá de Henares or Guadalajara.\n\nA taxi from the airport to Alcalá costs €35-40.\n\n===By train===\n* \n* \n* . It also serves the [https://quadernillos.com/ Quadernillos mall], where the local [https://www.cinesladehesa.com/cuadernillos cinema] is.\n\n===By bus===\nBuses from Madrid start from Avenida de América, outside the Metro station. Line 223 runs to central Alcalá (Vía Complutense) every 15 min or so between 06:00 and 10:00, then every 30 min. Journey time is 40 min; last bus into Madrid is at 23:00, last bus out to Alcalá is at 00:00. If you want to stop near the centre of Alcalá, get off in the first stop after you see the medieval walls on the right side.\n\nBus 227 runs to Alcalá university campus at Escuela Politécnica, M-F every 15-30 min, taking one hour. This circles the northern burbs of Alcalá and isn't convenient for the centre. \n\nBus 229 runs to Alcalá Virgen del Val bus station, east end of town, M-F every 15-30 min and hourly at weekends, taking 50 min. This bus serves the south edge of town along Calle Ronda Fiscal and isn't convenient for the centre.\n\nNight bus N202 runs to Alcalá between 00:00 and 06:00, hourly Su-Th and every 30 min F Sa &amp; holidays, taking 40 min. It runs through the centre along Via Complutense and east as far as Calle Avila.\n\nTwo Alsa buses per day from Madrid stop in Alcalá on the way to Zaragoza (4 hours) and Barcelona (7-8 hours).\n\n== Get around ==\nThe historic centre is compact and easily explored on foot. Alcalá bus service has a flat fare of  per ride; buy tickets from the driver. \n\n== See ==\nThe heart of the old town is '''Plaza de Cervantes''', with all the main sights close by, and storks nests teetering on the rooftops. The north side of the Plaza leads into the colonnaded Calle Mayor, with many bars and eating places.\n\n* , concessions \n| wikipedia=University of Alcalá | image=Universidad de Alcalá de Henares.

In many bars there is a menu of tapas and you must chose one when you order your drink. Tapas in Alcalá are the most generous in the Community of Madrid|Community of Madrid. \n\nAlcalá is known for its ''almendras garrapiñadas'', a sugar-coated almond candy.  You can buy them at ''El Convento de San Clarisas de San Diego'' (Calle Beatas 5), a cloistered abbey where the nuns make the candies with nothing but \"almonds, sugar and love.\".

                    "text": "\n\n\n'''Alcamo''' is a town in the Trapani (province)|Trapani province of western Sicily.\n\nThe climate is mild and its central position on the Gulf of Castellammare offers views of Mount Bonifato and the vineyard-covered rolling hills of the surrounding countryside. If you are at Alcamo Marina it is still possible to behold sand dunes.\n\nThe combination of town, mountain, country, beach and sea makes for a vacation full of contrasts.\n\n==Understand==\n===When to go===\nAlcamo is practically full of opportunities all the year round: in winter you can take advantage of Christmas events to visit the monuments in the town centre and the places of its \"movida\" (pubs, bars and pizzerias in particular), while in summer it is possible to walk along the promenade full of very good pizzerias too.\n\nIt is also a good idea to visit the town in June so you can take part in the celebrations in honour of Madonna of Miracles (Most Holy Mary of Miracles) or in spring if you wish to take advantage of the mild climate and visit the Nature Reserve and the ancient ruins on Mount Bonifato.\n\n===History===\n\n\nThough people think that Alcamo were founded by Arabs during the Middle Ages, the excavations in the surrounding territory confirm that there were already settlements near the present town in prehistoric times. Before the arrival of Arabs there were two villages: the first one, Longuro, was on Mount Bonifato, while the second, called Longarico, was near the present built-up areas.\n\nWhen the Arabs arrived at the village, they saw it was semi-desert and so they founded Alcamo. Afterwards the town passed under the dominion of Normans and Swabians. In time the old mosques were substituted by Catholic churches and only the ancient Arab fountain, still running, and the name of the town, whose meaning is uncertain, remained.\n\nThe built-up areas became a well fortified feud thanks to the construction of the Castle of the Counts of Modica and the walls surrounding the present town centre.\n\nIn the following centuries Alcamo progressively developed from the cultural point of view, both for literature (whose most important representative is the poet Cielo d’Alcamo) and the artistic production; in fact there are very important sculptures and paintings inside its churches, especially in the Cathedral (Chiesa Madre) where an art museum has been opened in order to collect some of these masterpieces.\n\n===Districts===\n\nOwing to its particular geographical position (with '''Mount Bonifato''' in the south and the '''Gulf of Castellammare''' in the north) a lot of streets have an inclination from the mountain, in the south, towards the sea, in the north. Mount Bonifato and the coastline are also two excellent points of reference because they can be seen from any place in town.\n\n''Corso 6 Aprile'' is very important: it is known by its citizens as “il Corso”(or ''lu Cassaru'' in dialect). This main street starts from the w:Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie (Alcamo)|Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie and finishes at ''Porta Palermo''; on the way you will also pass the w:Church of Saints Paul and Bartholomew|Church of Saints Paul and Bartholomew baroque church with its rich interior and Piazza Ciullo, which is full of young people at night.\n\nIn ''Piazza Ciullo'' (called “the Square” or “la Chiazza” in dialect), you can see the Town Hall, the Church of the Jesuits' College (Chiesa del Collegio) which is in the middle of the square and has a big round clock, Saint Olivia’s Church, restaurants and sandwich bars. Going towards Chiesa del Collegio and turning on the left, you will arrive at ''Piazza della Repubblica'', where you can admire the Castle of Counts of Modica and find also a large car park.\n\n\nAt Piazza Ciullo the main street (Corso) has a sudden narrowing: starting from this point it is called the “Narrow Corso” (“Cassaru Strittu\" in dialect). The Cathedral (Chiesa Madre) is here; if you go straight on, you will reach the Church of Saint Francis of Assisi and finally the end of the Main Street coinciding with ''Porta Palermo'' which opens onto ''Piazza Bagolino'', called the \"Bastione\" (or \"lu Bastiuni\"in dialect) owing to its high walls of defence surrounding the square. This is delimited by a sidewalk from where you can admire, above all at sunset, a very striking view, together with the coastline of Alcamo Marina. Going down Piazza Bagolino, after two turnings, you will get to a large square where you can admire the ancient Arab fountain. On its right there is a paved pathway leading to the  ''Sanctuary of the Most Holy Mary of Miracles'', which can be reached on foot through this paved road, or by car through a narrow street nearby.\n\nStarting from Piazza Pittore Renda, with ''Corso 6 Aprile'' behind, you can go round a roundabout (with the small Church of Our Lady of Graces in its middle) and arrive at ''Viale Italia'' which ends with another roundabout (known as \"La Rotonda\" par excellence). If you turn left you will get to ''Viale Europa'' where there are several interesting bars in which it is possible to taste some typical local recipes. By taking one of the right streets (''Via Monte Bonifato'' in particular) you will arrive at the Nature Reserve on Mount Bonifato, while if you go ahead you will get to a crossroads, and by turning left you will first meet the Church of Saint Mary of Jesus (Chiesa di Santa Maria di Gesù) and then a small roundabout with a statue of Saint Francis in the middle.\n\nFrom this roundabout you can go to Piazza Bagolino (by turning right and through '''Via Florio''') or to '''Piazza della Repubblica''', turning on the left.\n\n===Tourist information===\n\n* \n* \n\n==Get in==\n===By plane===\n* \n* \nThere are also taxi and shuttle bus services from Palermo and Trapani airports as far as Alcamo (for information phone: Gabellone Viaggi e turismo, Viale Italia, 31, .\n\n===By ship===\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===By car===\n*From Palermo: you can reach Alcamo by taking the Autostrada A29 Palermo-Mazara del Vallo (a motorway) as far as the junction Alcamo Est (about 64 km).\n*From Trapani: along a branch of A29 (direction Palermo and as far as the motorway junction Alcamo Ovest) or the highway 113 (about 52 km).\n\nBetween the junction Alcamo Est and Alcamo Ovest there is another motorway junction, for the neighbouring town of Castellammare del Golfo.\n\nThese motorways have two lanes and an emergency carriageway; people don't have to pay any toll but there are no petrol stations in these motorways. However, you can refuel in the towns near the motorways.\n\n===By train===\n\nThe nearest railway stations are Alcamo Diramazione (at about 7 km from the town, near the junction Alcamo ovest) and the station of Castellammare del Golfo (located at Alcamo Marina,  about 5 km from the town centre).\n\n===By bus===\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Get around==\n\n\nIn the town centre you can easily move on foot, leaving the car in the large car parks at Piazza Bagolino and Piazza della Repubblica.

The only habitation near the ruins was a Moorish farmstead on the hill above, ''al-kudja'' in Arabic. In 1229 Jaume I of Aragon muscled in on the territory, and from 1298 Jaume II built the walled town of Alcúdia.\n\nNot much happened for the next 700 years, so it remained a small town and port unspoilt by industry.

The main settlement is St Anne, a pleasant village in the middle of the island that's simply referred to as \"Town\".\n\n== Understand ==\nImage:Guernsey-CIA WFB Map.png | right \nAlderney is said to be \"the only true Channel Island\" since it alone sits in the English Channel, with fierce currents ripping by its shores. It's well north of Guernsey, Jersey and the others which are actually in the Bay of St Malo. Like them, it's a self-governing Crown Dependency, not part of the United Kingdom (and semi-autonomous within the Bailiwick of Guernsey) but ceding defence and international affairs to the UK. In practice it was vice versa, as the Channel Islands defended the UK. The other islands did so by obstructing France, so those were heavily fortified during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Alderney by its position helped to project British naval power into the western Channel. In the mid-19th century, the British panicked that a resurgent France might again challenge them, so they began greatly extending the harbour - only the western half was built, with a very long breakwater. They also built a ring of 13 fortresses around the island that were impressive, expensive, and pretty much useless.\n\nIn World War II in Europe|World War II the Channel Islands were occupied by the Germans, who reinforced several fortresses on Alderney and added their own positions. They also established two forced-labour camps, and two concentration camps run by the SS. At least 700 died here. The islanders, who had mostly been evacuated, returned to a shattered landscape. Post-war Alderney was agricultural with tourism on a small scale. It has become a domicile for various cyber-ventures, including online gambling.\n\n== Get in ==\n[http://www.aurigny.com/ Aurigny] fly between Guernsey and Alderney 2-3 times a day taking 15 min, return £60, and a day trip is possible either way.

In Guernsey St Peter Port, it's usually the \"Inter-Island Quay\" down the pier on the right, but at low tide it may be next to the Weighbridge roundabout (the \"Cambridge Steps\" are no longer used).

This is Anglican, built in 1850, trashed during the occupation but restored after the war. \n* \n*  is the best preserved of the many forts and bastions dotted around the coast. Built in the 19th century, it's on a tidal island on the west coast, though the causeway is only covered by the highest tides. Admire the setting and exterior, but you can't go in, as it's now self-catering accommodation (sleeps 13) run by the island's Landmark Trust.\n\n* '''Other forts:''' 13 were built in Victorian times against the French, and others were added in wartime. Clockwise from Fort Clonque there are visible remains of:\n** Fort Tourgis is extensive, with the Victorian structure reinforced by the Germans as ''Stutzpunkt Türkenburg'', and partly open to visits within.\n** Fort Platte Saline is nowadays used as a gravel store.\n** Fort Doyle, close to town, is a tiny fort rebuilt in wartime.\n** Fort Grosnez in the harbour is substantial, and the breakwater beyond is even more so. This is actually a much-shortened version, as repairing the repeated storm damage to the original was unsustainable. \n** Fort Albert is sturdy, as it was intended as a citadel in case invaders overran the island.\n** Bibet Head is a wartime bunker, a bit spooky and smelly, as party animals sometimes use it as a rave space.\n** Fort Chateau a L’Etoc is substantial yet out of the way on the north coast - it was intended to command an eastern harbour extension that was never built. It's nowadays private accommodation but sometimes open for events such as the arts festival.\n** [https://www.visitalderney.com/stay/fort-corblets/ Fort Corblets] is nowadays self-catering accommodation.\n** Fort Les Hommeaux Florains is on an islet, the causeway having been swept away.

It's more correctly \"Naval Direction Tower MP3\" but you'll see how it got its nickname. The railway terminates here. \n**  is on a little island off the east coast.

It was a bad idea on such an unsheltered coast and the Germans demolished it in case Allied commandoes got any ideas about landing there. \n**  is now centrepiece of a woodland wildlife reserve. \n** Nothing else along the south coast until you complete the circuit back to Fort Clonque.\n\n*  near Fort Tourgis was built in 1796 and is under restoration. There are records of a mill here from 1236.  \n* '''The lighthouse''' is prominent at Mannez near Fort Quesnard. Summer Sundays there are tours up the structure.\n* '''Nazi prison camps''' on Alderney held some 6000 men but almost their only remnants are the fortifications that those men were forced to build. There were two \"volunteer\" labour camps, ''Borkum'' and ''Helgoland'', and two concentration camps run by the SS, ''Nordeney'' and ''Sylt''. There are 397 known graves but at least 700 prisoners died on the island or on ships bringing them here, with two major wreckings. There's a small plaque on the site of ''Sylt'' next to the airport, ''Nordeney'' is now beneath the island campsite, while ''Helgoland'' a little way northwest of town and ''Borkum'' near Kiln Farm are lost under brambles. Hammond Memorial, north towards Saye Beach, commemorates the losses in Russian, Hebrew, Polish, French and Spanish. \n* '''Prehistoric remains''' are scrappy, as the megaliths were smashed or re-used as masonry. Roc à L'Epine near Fort Tourgis is a burial chamber from 4000 BC, and near Longis Beach is an Iron Age pottery, circa 500 BC.\n*  a mile northwest of Alderney is a bird reserve, and landing is not permitted during the nesting season April-July. Outside those months, there's a very basic shack which can be used overnight by birdwatchers. There's no fresh water, and the sea is your ''en suite''.\n* '''Dark skies''' at night, which midsummer is after 22:00. There's not much artificial lighting so if you get away from town and harbour on a clear night then conditions are good for Astronomy | sky-watching.\n\n== Do ==\n\n* '''What's on?'''

                    "text": "\n\n\n'''Aleppo''' (حلب, ''Ḥalab'') is the largest city in Syria - population 2.1 million. One of the oldest continuously-inhabited cities in the world, it has a wealth of historical sites, and its old city is listed as a .\n\n==Understand==\nImage:AlepQalat.jpg|400px|thumb|The Aleppo Citadel As it is in any Muslim country, the call to prayer is called out from mosques five times a day starting in the early morning. Aleppo's muezzins are traditionally well known for their beautiful calls to prayer.\n\nAleppo is a fairly conservative city. Dress appropriately to avoid any problems and to avoid standing out too much. Men should wear shirts and trousers and women should not wear anything that is too revealing.  If you follow that simple dress code you should not have any problems. Head scarves are not necessary unless you want to enter a mosque or church but even then grey robes are available at no extra charge.\n\nPrior to the Syrian Civil War, Aleppo was known for its large Armenian community, many of whom were descended from refugees fleeing the Armenian Genocide remembrance|Armenian Genocide, but it is unknown how many remain after the war.\n\nAleppo was the epicenter of the fighting during much of the Syrian Civil War which erupted as a result of the Arab Spring in 2010. Syrian government forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad eventually prevailed over the rebel groups following Russian intervention in 2016, thus returning all of the city of government control, but not before it had suffered over 30,000 deaths and much of the old city had been destroyed.\n\nThere are no hostile feelings towards Americans or Westerners in general (although Americans tend to be subjected to more scrutiny by the authorities than other nationalities). You could, however, find yourself in trouble if you engage in open criticism of and against the Syrian government or the president.  Your best bet is to avoid political conversations all together just to avoid any possible problems. If you do engage in political discussions with Syrians, be aware that they might face intense questioning by the secret police if you are overheard. As a general rule, always assume that you are being watched by the plain-clothes policemen (''mukhabarat''). You will notice that not many uniformed policemen can be seen in the streets, but this is because the police have a wide network of plain-clothes officers and informants.\n\nFriday is a holy day and most shops and historic sites are closed so plan accordingly for this.\n\nStealing is looked down upon and thus is not very common.  Crime is generally low and you should feel safe to walk around in any part of the city at any time day or night. But as in any city, it's a good idea to keep an eye on your belongings, particularly in the souk.\n\nMeals are a bit later than in the U.S. but similar to the times in some European countries.  Lunch is from 13:00 to 15:00 and dinner around 20:00. Syrians take a siesta in the middle of the day, from about 15:00 to 18:00, but this means that the night life is very active.  You can return to the markets and public squares that you visited during the day and by 22:00 they will be bustling with people selling food and treats and drinks.  It is a like a street fair every night.\n\nAleppo is a beautiful and historic city, but is too dangerous to recommend visiting.\n\n=== Climate ===\n\n\nAleppo has a cool steppe climate. The mountain series that run along the Mediterranean coast, the Alawiyin Mountains and the Nur Mountains, largely block the effects of the Mediterranean on climate (rain shadow effect). More than 80% of precipitation occurs between October and March. It snows once or twice every winter. Average humidity is 55.7%.\n\n==Get in==\n\nAs of 2019, travel to Aleppo is difficult as major highways are blocked by the civil war and travel on roads that are can take a long time due to frequent military checkpoints. It is however possible to travel overland from Damascus independently or by bus. Travel from Turkey is not possible.\n\n=== By plane ===\nAs of 2023 there's a limited number of scheduled flight to Aleppo, including a few international flights per week, to Yerevan () and Erbil (). However, flights often have to be cancelled at short notice as the airport is a frequent target of Israeli missile strikes.\n\n* .\n}}\n\n=== By train ===\n\nAll long distance trains, including international trains, are cancelled indefinitely. Repairs on the route from Damascus via Homs and Hama have picked up pace, and there has been rumours that a limited number of passenger trains might return, however it is very unclear if or when this will happen. National operator '''CFS''' do run a local commuter train from the suburb and major refugee camp ''Jibreen'', of little use to visitors.\n\n* \n&lt;!-- Saved former text here for reference\nAleppo is close to the main border crossing with Turkey.  You will need a visa to enter into Syria.  It is typically more convenient to secure a visa in your home country as the consulates in Turkey do not usually issue tourist visas.  How you get the visa varies by country so check with a travel agent or consult.  Citizens of the predominantly Arab nations and Turkish citizens do not require a visa.\n\nAt the border, most nationalities can secure a 2-week transit visa in 20–30&amp;nbsp;minutes. American passport holders, however, will have to wait between 3 to 10&amp;nbsp;hours to secure a transit visa, as the border guards must fax Damascus to check with Syrian intelligence, and may be turned away.  A transit visa is US$16, payable in USD or SYP. Each border post has a branch of the Central Bank of Syria to exchange currencies.  There are no facilities for credit/debit cards. Travellers cheques are also not accepted.\n\nRemember that there is a departure fee of 500 SYP.\n\nAleppo has quite extensive public transport connections with Turkey|Turkish cities just north of the border. There are at least two daily '''bus/minibus''' services from Antakya|Antioch (3 hr). Gaziantep, on the other hand, has twice weekly '''trains''' to Aleppo (5 hr, departing from Gaziantep at 20:30 on Tuesdays and Fridays and arrive five hours later in Aleppo, at an inconvenient 01:29), costing €12.75 pp one-way. There is also a once-weekly train service from Mersin on Mediterranean Turkey|Turkish Mediterranean coast, also calling at Adana. Trains depart from Mersin at 23:00 on Fridays and call at Adana station around midnight. They arrive in Aleppo at 08:10 next morning and cost €14/€13 pp from Mersin/Adana respectively.\n\nFrom Lebanon several daily buses leave from Beirut's Charles Helou bus station going via Tripoli and Homs.\n--&gt;\n\n==Get around==\n\n\nTaxis are everywhere, probably more taxis than people.  They are easy to take and very affordable but just make sure it is a licensed taxi.\n\nMinibuses: Called \"serveece\", these are small white vans that drive around and you can hop on and off by signalling to the driver. They get very full in rush hours.\n\nRental cars: Hertz and other rental car agencies are available in Aleppo but the driving can be very hectic and if you are not accustomed to driving in a place with few rules and almost no regard for street signs you should probably not attempt to drive on your own.\n\n==See==\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n=== Museums ===\n* \n* \n* \n\n=== Mosques ===\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n=== Churches ===\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Do==\nWalk around the city at least a few times to really get a feel for what it is like. It is a vibrant and lively place that will continually surprise you. Any amount of time spent walking around the city will reveal another historical site or point of interest. Check out the Christian section of the city to see a different part of Aleppo. If you want to shop for clothes, al-Telal street is bustling nearly every night with crowds checking out the shops and street stands piled high with every type of clothing imaginable.\n\n==Buy==\nImage:AlepSouq.jpg|thumb|A quiet moment in the Aleppo Souq on Friday, before the civil war.\n\nGold: Although the prices are as high as they have ever been, gold is still a worthwhile purchase here. There is a special gold pattern called the Aleppo weave or chain that is made only in Aleppo. All gold is sold by weight and is 22 carat.\n\nBoxes: Aleppo is also famous for its intricate inlay work that can be found in boxes of all shapes and sizes. These boxes are beautiful and can be found at almost all of the shops in the souq. A great, affordable gift to take home.\n\nWraps/tablecloths: There are many nice wraps that can be worn as shawls or used as tablecloths that are also available everywhere in the souqs. Another good gift.\n\nSweets: Pistachios are everywhere in Aleppo and accordingly there are many different kinds of sweets made from the pistachio. These usually come in a decorative box and are yet another good gift.\n\nCoffee and spices: It is impossible to walk through the souq without being caught up in the scent of freshly ground coffee and spices like cumin. You can also buy very ornate pots to make your coffee in.\n\nSoap: One of the most famous Aleppine products is its olive oil soap. Many factories produce this using traditional techniques. The price varies depending on the proportion of olive and laurel oil, prices and assortment is better in the shops just in the 2 roads south of the Clock Tower rather than in the Souq's tourist traps, even if most shop keepers speak very little English (prices per kilo are clearly shown).\n\n==Eat==\nImage:AlepFustuq.jpg|thumb|Sweets with pistachios.\nThe area around Aleppo is famous for pistachio farming, so be sure to try the baklava and other pistachio-based sweets while you're here.\n\nCommon Syrian street food like falafels and shwarma are excellent and available throughout the city. In the souks you will also find tiny restaurants with a few stools serving up dishes like Fuul (pronounced “fool”), a  bean soup served with fresh bread, onions and mint. If you are adventurous, look for the men frying curry-flavoured pancakes near the entrance to the souk. The pancakes are wrapped in bread and topped with hot sauce. Also try and buy some of the freshly made pita bread that is sold everywhere as it is delicious.\n\nFor breakfast, a fresh glass of juice and cheese sandwich can be had from the juice stands near the clock tower. Many cafés also serve great ice cream for a treat.\n\nIf you are tired after a day of wandering around the souk, try one of the cafés near the base of the citadel. They offer light snacks and drinks, including a wide range of coffees and refreshing glasses of minted lemonade.\n\nTravellers on a strict budget should be prepared to eat very similar meals everyday as there is not a lot of variety in the diet at the cheaper end of the range.\n\nThere are plenty of good restaurants around and meals are very affordable.\n\n* \n\n===In the Christian Quarter (El Jedeide) district===\n* \n* \n* \n* '''Sheraton Hotel'''. It may seem wrong to come to Syria and head for the Sheraton but they do offer an excellent buffet breakfast, which, if you're willing to splurge, makes a nice change from the typical Syrian fare and will set you up well for a day of exploring. They also do a fine cup of coffee.\n\n===In Aziziyeh===\n\n* '''Al- Challal'''\n*    WANES  Restaurant\n\n==Drink==\n\nAlcohol is permitted but not widely available. You can find stores selling liquor on a few streets near the clocktower. Try Zaki al-Arsuzi (across from Al Kommeh restaurant) and Jbrail Dalal streets.  There is a liquor store a few metres away from the Aleppo Hotel (on a side street from the clocktower).  In the new city there is a store at Al Hateb square.  Restaurants and hotels that cater to Westerners will generally serve alcoholic beverages.\n\nThere is one local beer, called Al-Sharq, while the Damascus brew Barada may also be found. Neither are exactly lethal - 3.7% and 3.4% respectively.\n\nA wide range of other beers from the Middle East and Europe can also be found, along with wines from Syria, Lebanon and France.\n\nArak is a local aniseed spirit which can be found at some small shops.\n\n* \n\n==Sleep==\n\n===Budget===\n\n* '''Al-Gawaher''' – Bab al-Faraj Street, Behind Library. Perhaps the best backpacker spot in Aleppo. Rooms have satellite TV and both en suite and shared bathrooms are very clean. Many have balconies and others overlook a common area, where travellers often meet to chat. The rooftop gives great views over the city and is another nice spot to spend the evening. Staff are friendly and English is spoken. Tours can be arranged to the Dead Cities, Apamea and other sites. The only possible downside is that staff are late risers and so getting breakfast can be a problem. Breakfast is not included. There is, however, free coffee and tea available 24/7.\n* '''Hotel Alnagm Alakhdar''' (aka Hotel Green Star) – Around the corner from the Al-Gawaher on Sharia Hammam Al Tal (next to the Sheraton parking entrance off the Clock Tower end of Bab El Faraj - it could not be more central - 963-21-212 60 23, mob. 963 -944-25 76 45), it also has a nice roof terrace but the atmosphere is not nearly as lively. The rooms come with sinks and fans or aircom. There are no TVs in the rooms but two shared ones: one in the lounge and the second one on the top floor. Try and get one on the top floor that opens onto the roof terrace. Staff speak a little English but are very helpful. Breakfast is not included.\n* '''Hotel Kaser Alandaloss''' - Just off Bab Al-Faraj Street, in sight of the clock tower on a small block, nestled between a couple of soap merchant stores. The rooms are nice, and they have excellent showers and a comfortable central area to sit, eat, use the internet. There's no option for breakfast, but if you want some tea or some food, they are more than likely to make some for you.\n\n===Mid-range===\n\n* \n&lt;!--\n* '''Tourist Hotel''' - Well known for having sparkling clean bathrooms, perhaps the cleanest in all of Syria according to some reports.\n* '''Hotel Somar''' – It is nothing fancy but rooms here are clean with satellite TV, bathrooms and a little shared courtyard. The price is expensive, however, compared to the budget hotels, which offer rooms of a similar standard.  --&gt;\n\n===Splurge===\n* \n* \n\n'''Hotels that are closed''' as of early 2020:\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n==Connect==\nAn internet access in the old town and near the main attractions (the Citadel, the Souq and the Grand Mosque) can be found at Tara Cafe. It is located in the underground lair of the caravansary of the Adlliyah Mosque and provides standard rates for internet access. It is not an internet cafe, but rather a cafe that provides internet access as a service on laptops that can be rented by the hour.\n\nThe Friends Cafe Net is also located in the area of the Citadel. From the entrance to the Citadel, walk straight (south) to a block with shawarma &amp; chicken outlets on the ground floor. The cafe is just behind the block in a small street called \"Jnenyt al-Fariq(1)\". From the outlets, follow the street to your right, turn left then immediately right.\n\nThe closest internet cafe to most of the budget hotels, in the Bab al-Faraj area, is the Concord, which is in an ice cream parlor and cafe by the same name. It charges an outrageous rate for Aleppo and Syria and general.\n\nThe other internet cafe within walking distance is at Adam Cafe, across the street from the Baron Hotel. Nevertheless, the internet cafe is in the bottom story of an all-male tea house which may make female customers feel uncomfortable. If you wander around the new Christian quarter of al-Aziziyeh you can find many internet cafes such as Area 51, Montana and Kool Net which offer high speed access. All of the aforementioned cafes provide discount cards for chunks of time.\n\n==Stay safe==\nMany buildings in the city, particularly in the Salaheddin neighborhood and surrounding areas, have been damaged severely by the civil war. Buildings can and do collapse, often with deadly consequences. Stay away from buildings that have sustained heavy damage or look structurally unstable.\n\n==Cope==\n===Consulates===\n*  \n\n==Go next==\n* Damascus\n\n\n\n"

The city is a faded shadow of its former glorious cosmopolitan self, but still worth a visit for its many cultural attractions and still-palpable glimpses of its past.\n\n== Understand ==\n=== History ===\n\n\n\nFew cities of the world have a history as rich as that of Alexandria; few cities have witnessed so many historic events and legends. Founded by Alexander the Great (''Iskander al-Akbar'') in 331 BCE, Alexandria became the capital of Greco-Roman Empire|Roman Egypt; its status as a beacon of culture is symbolized by Pharos, the legendary lighthouse.\n\nThere had long been a fishing village here, called Rhakotis, but Alexander had greater plans for it. Its strategic value was obvious: it had a great natural harbour, a backing lagoon to prevent land attack, a fertile hinterland, and potential control of trade routes up the Nile and overland to the Red Sea and Arabia. But the approach to the harbour was tricky: the coastline and off-shore islands were low and without landmarks, so sailors could easily take the wrong channel and get wrecked on the shoals. To guide them in, On the trail of Alexander the Great#After Alexander|Alexander's successors Ptolemy I &amp; II built a '''lighthouse''' on the nearby island of Pharos. It stood just over 100 m tall, so only the Great Pyramids were taller. A bronze mirror atop it reflected sunlight by day, and by night the flames of oil-soaked sheep fleeces. It was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the name of the island \"Pharos\" came to apply to all subsequent lighthouses, and spawned modern words such as \"phares\" in French.\n\nA jetty over 1 km long was built to connect Pharos to the mainland, dividing the bay into an eastern and western harbour. Silt and landfill built up along the jetty so it broadened into a peninsula, the present-day district of Anfushi. The lighthouse was badly damaged by earthquakes in 956, 1303 and 1323, then fell into disuse and disrepair. In 1480 Sultan Qaitbey used the ruined stone to build his fortress here. The rest of it was eaten by coastal erosion, and came to lie on the sea-bed. But a combination of ancient descriptions, modern marine archaeology and satellite imaging give us a detailed picture of it.\n\nAlexandria under Ptolemy I &amp; II prospered not just through trading, but as a knowledge economy. They set out to acquire and understand every manuscript they could. Arriving ships were searched, and any manuscripts seized and copied onto papyrus. In the great '''Library of Alexandria''' texts were translated, catalogued and studied. Scholars, philosophers and scientists flocked to work on these texts, and to create new material. Just one example of their creative output was the ''Septuagint'', the first Greek translation of Hebrew holy texts that became the Christian Bible Old Testament.\n\nTrade and knowledge made Alexandria cosmopolitan, with the largest Jewish populations and Hellenistic cultures anywhere. It retained its importance, and was capital of Egypt, while power was shifting elsewhere: the rise and decline of Rome, the rise of Byzantium, and growth of Persia. But the city suffered natural disasters (eg the tsunami of 365 CE) and a series of wars (particularly against Rome), and the library was destroyed. When the Arabs conquered Egypt in 641 CE they founded a new capital to the south in Fustat, now Cairo. Politically, economically and intellectually, Alexandria was no longer the place to be.\n\nAlexandria survived as a trading port; On the trail of Marco Polo|Marco Polo described it around 1300 as one of the world's two busiest ports, along with Quanzhou. However, its strategic location meant that every army on its way to Egypt passed through: Napoleon's troops stormed the city in 1798, but the British conquered it in the '''Siege of Alexandria''' in 1801. The Egyptians under Mohammed Ali took control of the city and rebuilt it, but the Orabi Rebellion in 1881 and massacres of Europeans in the city led the British to strike back and hammer the rebels with the three-day '''Bombardment of Alexandria''', reducing much of the city center to rubble.\n\nOnce again, Alexandria rose from the ashes. Its cosmopolitan and decadent lifestyle before and during World War II gave birth to its greatest poet, '''Constantine P. Cavafy''', and was chronicled in Laurence Durrell's ''Alexandria Quartet'' and a series of works by E.M. Forster including ''Alexandria: A History and Guide'' (1922), described by some as the best travel guide ever written.\n\nYet this world, too, took a shattering blow in the 1950s when Egypt's new fiercely nationalist leader Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized vast swathes of the economy and forbade foreigners from owning or running companies. This forced tens of thousands of foreigners out of the country, including virtually all of Alexandria's once 150,000-strong Greek community. Alexandria thus ceased to be a cosmopolitan city.\n\nToday's Alexandria is a dusty seaside Egyptian town with miles of tatty low-rise and 'burbs holding its population of 5 million, yet its status as Egypt's leading port keeps business humming, and tourists still flock to the beaches in the summertime. And while much of the city is badly in need of major repair, its history is still evident: the French-style parks and the occasional French street sign survive as a legacy of Napoleon, and the few remaining Greek restaurants and cafés still do a good trade.\n\n=== Climate ===\n\n\n: ''See also: Egypt#Climate''\n\nAlexandria has a hot desert climate (BWh), but highly influenced by sea breeze, with sunny hot humid summers and mild moderately wet winters. The daytime can be humid in summer, with summer temperatures averaging 31&amp;nbsp;°C (88&amp;nbsp;°F), but evenings are usually cooler and breezy, especially by the Corniche. Winters can get cold, with daytime highs down sometimes to 12&amp;nbsp;°C (53&amp;nbsp;°F), with occasional rain and sometimes hail. Humidity is high throughout the year. The best time to visit Alexandria is in spring (March–June) and autumn (September–November). It's at its busiest in summer, when Egyptians flock down to escape the searing heat of Cairo.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:smaller; width:70%;\"\n|+[http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/egypt/alexandria.php Alexandria mean sea temperature]\n|-\n!Jan\n!Feb\n!Mar\n!Apr\n!May\n!Jun\n!Jul\n!Aug\n!Sep\n!Oct\n!Nov\n!Dec\n|-\n|18°C (64°F)\n|17°C (63°F)\n|17°C (63°F)\n|18°C (64°F)\n|20°C (68°F)\n|23°C (73°F)\n|25°C (77°F)\n|26°C (79°F)\n|26°C (79°F)\n|25°C (77°F)\n|22°C (72°F)\n|20°C (68°F)\n|}\n\n=== Orientation ===\nAlexandria is a long thin city, pinched between the swampy delta and the sea. Its east-west artery, the Corniche, rolls on for about 30 km. However the advantage to the visitor is that all transport is funnelled along this corridor, so you shouldn't wait more than a minute for a taxi, buses or microbus going your way. The tram line runs parallel a block or two further inland.\n\nAt the western tip lies the Citadel of Qaitbey, built near (and from) the ruined ancient lighthouse or Pharos. The Corniche then sweeps around the eastern harbour, with Anfushi the tongue of land behind it, to the central hotel area around Saad Zaghloul; then passes the east end of the harbour at the jetty opposite the new library. Almost all the sights, and the bulk of the accommodation and restaurants, are along this congested 5-6 km strip or nearby. But on and on eastwards rolls the Corniche through rundown beachfront districts of Rushdy, San Stefano and Mandarah. The blingy hotels of Montazah are a bright spot then the tat, burbs and ribbon-development resume, out to Aboukir.\n\n=== Tourist offices ===\n\n* \n** \n** \n** \n** \n** \n** \n\n== Get in ==\n\n\n=== By plane ===\nAlexandria has domestic flights daily from Cairo, Luxor, Hurghada and Sharm el-Sheikh, with Egyptair the main operator. Saudia Airlines fly from Jeddah and the Gulf States, and Turkish Airlines fly from Istanbul. Flights from Italy by Wizz Air have ended as of June 2023. And all of airlines of the country including: Air Cairo Air Arabia Nile Air FlyEgypt and Petroleum air services (PAS).\n\n | url= | email=\n| address= | lat=30.917778 | long=29.696389 | directions=\n| phone= | tollfree=\n| hours= | price=\n| wikipedia=Borg El Arab Airport | image=Borg El Arab Airport Departure Hall.jpg | wikidata=Q1194015\n| lastedit=2021-10-26\n| content=All flights into Alexandria use this airport 45 km southwest of downtown. It's small but modern, ample for the low passenger numbers it now handles. Cafe and clean toilets and that's about all. There is no public transport - a taxi downtown will take 60-90 min, and reckon at least  as they've no competition.\n}}\n\n'''El Nouzha''' airport was nearer the city but closed in 2011, supposedly for rebuilding with Borg el Arab just a temporary arrangement. The work was abandoned and there are no plans to re-open El Nouzha.\n\n'''Cairo''' () is the main portal of entry into Egypt and you travel onwards overland. The Cairo-Alex flight only makes sense as a connection with another flight.\n\n=== By train ===\nTrain is the best way to travel between central Cairo and Alexandria, with 30 services a day. Best of these are the \"Specials\", running non-stop and taking 2 hr 40 min; almost as good are the \"Express\" services taking around 3 hours (usually stopping only in Tanta on the way). These trains are clean and comfortable, air-conditioned, and with snacks available. One-way AC1 tickets cost  (Oct 2018). The fast trains are sometimes also called Spanish, French or Turbo because of their rolling stock. See \"Egypt#get around by train\" for how to buy tickets. Online, in advance, direct from the railway company ENR, is best.\n\nTrains from Cairo all depart from Cairo/Midan Ramses|Ramses Station. In Alexandria they arrive downtown at , where taxis and microbuses are waiting, or a 15-min stroll north along Nabi Daniel St brings you onto the Corniche. Nabi Daniel is a street market and closed to traffic, so taxis use the parallel Saad Zaghlool St.\n\nBut when your \"non-stop\" train arrives, and everyone piles out, ask around before following. You may have stopped 3 km east at  on Abu Qir St at the top of Mushir Ahmad Ismail St. Only get off here if you're heading for an eastern district such as San Stefano. Otherwise sit tight, and in a couple of minutes the train will rumble on and terminate at Misr Station.\n\nTrains to Alexandria also run from Marsa Matruh and the delta towns. These are \"ordinary\" trains that can't be booked online, so buy your ticket at the station. Some trains run directly from Luxor via Cairo, but these too are slow \"ordinary\" trains, and you're better taking fast trains and changing in Cairo.\n\n=== By bus ===\nSeveral bus companies offer a bus service into Alexandria at a very low price range: . Buses are air-conditioned and come complete with a hostess trolley service. Companies include Golden Arrow, West Delta, Super Jet, Pullman and El Gouna. Operating times vary from one company to another, but there are trips between Cairo and Alexandria virtually every hour from early morning until midnight.\n\nWhile the buses are perfectly comfortable, the duration of your journey from Cairo to Alexandria (and vice versa) will depend on your pick-up/drop-off point. Most buses start out from the Almaza Bus Station in Cairo/Heliopolis|Heliopolis and stop by Cairo/Midan Tahrir|Midan Tahrir and Cairo/Giza|Giza before finally setting out to Alexandria; if you join from Heliopolis expect a 4-5 hour trip rather than the average 2-3.\n\nThe main bus station is  but there are a number of bus pick-up/drop-off points inside Alexandria. These are usually either at ''Gedid'' station (except ''El Gouna'', which uses ''Sidi Gaber'' station) which is a bit far from the city of Alexandria so it shouldn't cost more than a  cab ride,  max. Don't take a taxi with anyone that approaches you right outside of the bus. Walk outside the station and catch a taxi there if you must. There is also a bus from ''Gedid'' to ''Sidi Gaber'', and from ''Sidi Gaber'' most parts of the city are accessible by minibus or tram if you are looking to save money. The bus fare will run you half a pound.\n\n=== By car ===\n\nThere are two roads between Cairo and Alexandria, both taking 3 hours. The usual cautions for driving in Egypt apply; see Egypt#By car.\n* '''Agriculture Road''' has a speed limit of 90 km/hr for private cars and has 4 lanes in each direction. This is the main road, so it can get a little crowded. It also gives access to Damnhour and Tanta.\n* '''Desert Road''' has a speed limit of 100 km/hr for private cars and has 4 lanes in each direction. True to the name, this crosses the desert and is less crowded and faster. There are cafes every few km.\n\n=== By boat ===\n\nAlex remains a major sea port, but all international passenger services are axed because of this region's turmoil and loss of tourist traffic. It may still be possible to arrange freighter travel, but with so many migrants trying to reach Europe from the Middle East by sea in the 21st century, they will be very wary about taking you. So your best bet may be to call in a favour from a friend with a gin-palace private yacht.\n\nThe Med cruise liners seldom visit here nowadays. Nile cruises still call at Alexandria, Cairo and the ancient Egyptian sites up to Luxor and Aswan. But all of these are package tourist itineraries, and not available to book as point-to-point ferries.\n\n== Get around ==\n\nAlexandria is a long, ''long'' city but there's good transport along the Corniche. It also extends several km inland past the lagoons, but you've no reason to go that way.\n\n=== By taxi ===\n\n\nAlexandria's yellow and black taxis are a good way to travel in the city, and a cheap one as well. Be careful though: taxis will uniformly refuse to use meters (the rates haven't been adjusted in years) and drivers love to take advantage of non-Alexandrians (both foreign and Egyptian), so it's best to agree on the fare before you get in. No taxi ride between any two points in the city should cost more than . If you are on a day trip to Alexandria, hire a taxi outside the railway station for the day and pay  per place. For example, pay around  if you plan to see 5 places in 3–4 hr, or  if you plan to see 8-10 places in 5–6 hr.\n\nTo get into a taxi, wave at the driver and yell the name of your destination. If the driver agrees they would park at the side of the road as soon as possible. Some taxis will stop to pick you up even if they already have a passenger, but such offers are best refused. Furthermore, always check back once you get out of the taxi, there is no number to call if you lose anything of value, and nearly no chances of having it returned.\n\n'''Fast Call''' taxis can be booked by phone at 19559 or 0800-999-9999 (toll free). These are pricier but generally much better than ordinary black and bright yellow cabs.\n\n'''Careem''' and '''Uber''' operate in Alexandria. You will need a local number, as the driver will call you back for details of the pickup and drop off points.\n\n=== By tram ===\n\n\nAlexandria has a creaky, slow but very cheap '''tram''' system that dates back to 1860 and looks the part — it's the oldest one still running in Africa. The route map is remarkably confusing and changes on a regular basis, but one factor stays constant: the network is split into the interurban '''Ramleh Lines''' (''Tram el-Raml''), which use '''blue-and-cream trams''' and run across the city a few blocks back from the sea towards the eastern suburbs, and the '''City Lines''' (''Tram el-Madina''), which use '''bright yellow trams''' and run west and south of central Alex. The two meet at '''Raml Station''' (محطة الرمل ''Mahattat el-Raml''), right at the heart of Alex. In general, the Ramleh Lines are relatively quick despite their age, as they have substantial stretches of dedicated and uninterrupted right-of-way; the City Lines, however, frequently get stuck in traffic.\n\nFor both lines, the flat fare is , bought on board. Note that the first car (out of three) in the blue trams is reserved for women only. The lines run until 1AM, every 10-30 min or so.\n\nProbably the most useful service for tourists is yellow tram #25, which runs from Raml Station to Ras el-Tin and Fort Qait Bey. You can also hop on any blue tram ''west'' from Sidr Gabr bus/railway station to get to Raml, but not all eastbound trams stop there.\n\n=== By bus ===\nThere are a variety of local bus services which have improved significantly in the past few years, but they are rather confusing for those who haven't lived in Alexandria for a while. Apart from city buses, you will also find \"mini-buses\", which work on hop-and-go basis. They are easily recognizable 14-person buses, which will stop when you wave and stop where you need to get off. The drivers rarely speak English, so make sure you know the Arabic name of your destination or that you already know where to stop. The routes are usually along the main streets, with drivers following well-known routes. The routes are written in Arabic on the sides of the vehicle, but even if you speak Arabic this may not be helpful; the drivers sometimes change routes without changing their signage. However, if you remain in Alexandria for some time you may learn the somewhat elaborate system of hand signals the locals have devised to indicate the desired destination. A journey will generally cost between .\n\n== See ==\n=== Historical monuments ===\n\n*  regular &amp;  concessions; Maritime Museum \n| wikipedia=Citadel_of_Qaitbay | image=CW QaitbayCitadel Front.jpg | wikidata=Q1938065\n| lastedit=2019-01-31\n| content=Set on the tip of the Anfushi/Pharos promontory, looking back over the eastern harbour and downtown Corniche. It was built by Mameluke Sultan Abdul-Nasser Qa'it Bay in 1477 CE, by re-cycling the stone of the ruined lighthouse. It tried (with limited success) to defend the city against invaders, from crusaders to Napoleon, and was in military use as late as 1882, when the British bombarded it.&lt;br /&gt;There are two entrances and admissions. West, facing your approach along the Harbour mall, is the ground-floor Maritime Museum - this is of little interest. (Its collection continues in a building on the mall.)

The name \"Kom el-Shouqafa\" means \"mound of shards\" as people brought offerings to the dead here in earthenware bowls, then smashed the empties before returning home. They are composed of a ground level construction that probably served as a funerary chapel, a deep spiral stairway and three underground levels (the lowest now flooded by groundwater) for the funeral rituals and entombment. The place was discovered in 1900 when the ground gave way under a donkey. Built as a separate (and older) catacomb, the '''Hall of Caracalla''' became linked when energetic tomb-robbers tunnelled through. It seems to have been a burial place for the Roman emperor's horses, as horse bones predominate. No, not the donkey's. The catacombs are interesting for their plan and for their decoration, as the last of the pharonic burials transitioned into Grecian and Roman styles. But if you've seen the richly decorated burial chambers around Luxor, this one will suffer by comparison.\n}}\n* , students \n| wikipedia=Pompey's Pillar (column) | wikidata=Q492487\n| lastedit=2024-08-02\n| content=An ancient monument, this 25-meter-high granite column was constructed in honor of the Emperor Diocletian in AD 297.

They also venture out to wrecks from ancient Greece, the Napoleonic era, and the Great War. They offer training courses, but beginners will do much better to train in the Red Sea. (They run trips there but you're probably going anyway.)

A few expatriates work in this section. This section is increasing now as many new factories are built in '''Borg el Arab'''.\n\nOther than that, there are some but not many international schools that employ expatriate teachers. Generally they pay less than the much more lucrative educational section in Cairo.\n\nAlexandria has got quite a large number of language schools. You can find girls-only, boys-only and mixed schools. Also international certificates -like the IGCSE or the American SAT I and SAT II- could be completed in most of these schools. Moreover, study is available in English, French and also German.\n\n== Buy ==\n\nStandard shop hours are daily until 10PM or later, but in summer they take a siesta from noon to 4PM. Ramadan hours also vary.\n\nTypically, vendors of a particular product cluster along a street.\n\n* '''Nabi Daniel''', the street between the railway station and Corniche, has many booksellers with titles in several languages.

The most central branch on Saad Zaghloul Square is open daily noon-2AM.\n\n* '''San Giovanni Club''' within that hotel has live music, singers and oriental dancers until late.\n\n== Sleep ==\n\nAccommodation in Alexandria has quite a different feel due to the old buildings with sometimes nice colonial style lobbies. There is a good selection of hotels in all price ranges.\n\n=== Apartments ===\nFor stays of a month or more, consider renting. Apartments are easy to come by, in a range of prices ( per week) and states of repair. Landlords/ladies tend to live in the same blocks and will be willing to haggle the rates. It's definitely worth visiting an apartment before placing any money down, preferably in late afternoon so you see how well the lighting works and the worst of any insect problems. (It's very unlikely to find any accommodation near the coast that's completely roach-free!)\n\n=== Budget ===\nIt is mostly not necessary to reserve ahead online, this is in general more expensive. Just check around where many hotels are—there are at least 7 or so near Triomphe Hotel, where you can walk in and ask for a price.

At various points in her past, Alexandria has been part of the District of Columbia, a regional slave trading market, an occupied city, a washed-up post-industrial hamlet, and a hometown to famous American heroes and rebels. Today, the town serves as an interesting day-trip alternative for weary tourists looking to escape the capital, a treasure trove of early American architecture, a romantic getaway for metro-area residents, and a bedroom community for the white-collar workers that fuel the Federal labor mills to the north.

More than just a tourist destination or open-air museum, Old Town is a vibrant community of residents who take great pride in their city. The streets north and south of King Street near the river boast nearly 4000 18th- and 19th-century buildings still used as private residences.

The location is known as a medieval residence of Russian princes. It was home to several important events in Russian history. The residence is now transformed into a convent and preserves noteworthy architectural sights, while the city is quite unremarkable.\n\n==Understand==\n===Geography===\nAlexandrov is on the eastern edge of ''Klin-Dmitrov ridge'', a series of hills lying north from Moscow. The city stands on the banks of the tiny river Seraya, the left tributary of the Sherna that further flows into the Klyazma. The area near Alexandrov is very typical for the central part of Russia: it is a nearly flat land with vast forests and small fields. Alexandrov is an important transport hub, the crossing of the principal Moscow&amp;ndash;Yaroslavl railway and the circular railway line around Moscow (the so-called ''Big Ring of Moscow Railway''). The M8 highway runs 25&amp;nbsp;km west from the city. A number of local roads pass through Alexandrov and offer connections to Kirzhach, Kol'chugino, Yuryev-Polsky, and to the cities of Moscow Oblast. The population of Alexandrov was 59,000 in 2018.\n\n===History===\nImage:Alexandrov-sloboda.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Alexandrova Sloboda with the Cathedral of St. Trinity and the hip-roof bell-tower of the Crucifixion\nThe settlement of Alexandrov is known since 14th century. However, the official foundation date is 1513, when Vasili III, the Grand Prince of Moscow, built a residence, fortifications, and first stone churches on the banks of the river Seraya. At that time, the settlement was known as ''Alexandrova sloboda'' or ''Alexandrovskaya sloboda'', which means that it was an independent community exempt from taxes and duties. In 1564, Ivan the Terrible, the son and the successor of Vasili III, made Alexandrov his permanent residence. He suffered from defeats in the war with Lithuania and felt constant fear of treason. Then, he decided to leave Moscow and to escape from the nobility in Alexandrov. Alexandrov shortly became the actual center of the country: for example, one of the first printing factories appeared here in 1568. However, some negative things appeared as well.\n\nTo protect himself, Ivan the Terrible organized a special army called ''oprichnina''. This army had superior rights and did not hesitate to rob and murder others (first of all, nobility and merchants). This made Alexandrov a strange and sorrowful place where Ivan the Terrible combined orthodoxal religiousness with the savageness and depravity. The flourish of Alexandrov lasted for 17 years, until 1581. In the fall of 1581, Ivan the Terrible killed his son (this accident is shown in the well-known painting by Ilya Repin) and left Alexandrov forever.\n\nThe town rapidly decayed and also suffered from Polish army during the Time of Troubles (1598-1613). In 1654, the former residence was transformed into a convent and later used as a place of exile. Alexandrov has been designated a town since 1778. It gained the regular rectangular layout and later (1870) hosted the Moscow&amp;ndash;Yaroslavl railway. In 20th century, Alexandrov was strongly industrialized and lost nearly all of its original buildings. The industry of the city includes the production of electronics (such as TV sets of the well-known ''Rekord'' brand), crystals and diamonds, textile, and alcohol.\n\n===Orientation===\nAs you arrive to the train and bus station of Alexandrov, you will find yourself on a large square, ''Komsomol'skaya ploschad'' ('''Комсомольская площадь'''). The street running perpendicular to the railway tracks is called ''ulitsa Lenina'' ('''улица Ленина'''). It will lead you through the central part of the city and finally bring you to another square, ''Sovetskaya ploschad'' ('''Советская площадь''') with the easily recognizable Cathedral of the Nativity on it. Here the street changes its name to ''Sovetskaya ulitsa'' ('''Советская улица'''), runs downhill, crosses the river, and comes to the convent &amp;ndash; the old Alexandrova sloboda. Following the same street after the convent, you will start a way east to Kol'chugino and Yuryev-Polsky.\n\nAnother important street is ''Krasnyi pereulok'' ('''Красный переулок''') that runs perpendicular to ulitsa Lenina. You will get to this street from the north while arriving by car from the M8 highway (from Moscow, Yaroslavl, and many other destinations). Following the same street in the southern direction will bring you to Kirzhach.\n\n==Get in==\n\n\n\nAlexandrov is on the boundary of Vladimir Oblast. It can be reached easily from Moscow Oblast and from Yaroslavl Oblast, while the connections from Vladimir Oblast are less frequent. Alexandrov is usually visited together with Kirzhach and Yuryev-Polsky or on the way to Rostov Veliky and Yaroslavl.\n\n===By plane===\nThe nearest international airport is in Moscow.\n\n===By train===\n\nTrains are preferable for travelling from Moscow, Yaroslavl, and Kirzhach:\n* '''From Moscow:''' local trains run every hour. The trains depart from ''Yaroslavsky station'', and the trip takes 2 hours. Additionally, there are 2 daily express trains to Yaroslavl and one express train terminating in Alexandrov. The express trains are slightly faster, but they require a \"long-distance\" ticket (see Russia#Get_around|Russia:Get around for details). All the local trains make a stop at Sergiev Posad. A number of long-distance trains departing from ''Yaroslavsky station'' will also stop in Alexandrov.\n* '''From Ivanovo:''' one local train runs early in the morning, while two long-distance trains to Moscow travel during the night. The trip takes five hours. On the way to Alexandrov, you will pass through Yuryev-Polsky and Kol'chugino.\n* '''From Kirzhach:''' local trains every 1.5–2 hours (mind the gap in the afternoon), the trip takes 40 minutes.\n* '''From Yaroslavl:''' same to Moscow, but there are just two local trains per day (travel time 4 hours) and two express trains (2.5 hours). A number of long-distance trains running in southern direction can be used as well. You will pass Rostov Veliky on your way.\nAdditionally, there are two local trains from Dmitrov. If you travel from Vladimir, take a local train to Orehovo-Zuevo and change there to another local train to Alexandrov. The whole trip will take at least 4 hours, so the direct bus connection is recommended instead.\n\nThere are two railway stations in Alexandrov.\n\n* \n* \n\n===By bus===\n* \n** '''From Moscow:''' 3 buses per day (# 676), departing from ''VDNH metro station''. The trip takes about two hours (mind longer trips during rush hours).\n** '''From Vladimir:''' 6 buses per day via Kol'chugino (3.5 hours).\n** '''From Yuryev-Polsky:''' 2 buses per day (2 hours).\n**There are several daily buses from Kirzhach. The town of Kol'chugino is another convenient transit point with buses to Alexandrov departing every 2–3 hours.\n\n===By car===\nAlexandrov has road connections to the neighboring towns of Kirzhach (37&amp;nbsp;km) and Kol'chugino (40&amp;nbsp;km). From Kol'chugino, you can further reach Yuryev-Polsky (77&amp;nbsp;km) or Vladimir (120&amp;nbsp;km, via ''Stavrovo'').\n\nMoscow Oblast and Yaroslavl Oblast can be reached via the 25-km connecting road that joins the M8 highway in the village ''Dvoriki''. The alternative way to Moscow Oblast is the road to ''Strunino'' and further to A108. The northern road to M8 (via ''Lukyantsevo'') is not recommended due to the poor quality.\n\n* '''From Moscow:''' take M8 highway towards Yaroslavl, then turn right in the village ''Dvoriki'' (130&amp;nbsp;km; 50&amp;nbsp;km from Sergiev Posad).\n* '''From Vladimir:''' take M7 highway towards Moscow, then turn right,  via ''Stavrovo'' and Kol'chugino (120&amp;nbsp;km).\n* '''From Yaroslavl:''' take M8 highway towards Moscow, then turn left in the village ''Dvoriki'' (190&amp;nbsp;km; 140&amp;nbsp;km from Rostov Veliky, 70&amp;nbsp;km from Pereslavl-Zalessky).\n\nThe parking space is available all round the city.\n\n==Get around==\nThe central part of the city is rather small and easily explored by foot. The convent and the train station are found on the opposite sides of the city center (about 20 min walk). A number of city bus routes are available: in particular, buses # 4 and 7 run between the station and the convent.\n\n==See==\n===Alexandrova sloboda===\nAlexandrova sloboda is the eldest part of the city and the former residence of Russian princes. It is niw the '''Assumption convent''' (''Успенский монастырь'') jointly operated by the Russian Orthodox Church and the museum. Sloboda is the must-see attraction in the whole city: come here to feel the quiet of ancient walls and churches and to learn something about Russian history. The present white-painted stone walls were built in 17th century and follow the general style of medieval Russian fortresses. Original ramparts from 16th century can be seen outside the walls. Inside the convent, you find several remarkable buildings:\nImage:Sobor in Alexandrova Sloboda.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cathedral of St. Trinity\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* '''Further buildings:''' ''church of Theodore Stratelates'' (надвратная церковь Феодора Стратилата: 1682, over-the-gate), ''church of the Presentation'' (церковь Сретения Господня: 1682, a small stocky building in Russian style), ''living chamber'' (келейный корпус: 1682, rebuilt in 19th century), and a number of small buildings from 18th &amp;ndash; 19th centuries. These buildings are pretty regular, since they were constructed after the decay of the prince residence, as regular churches and houses in a regular monastery.\n\n===Churches===\nImage:Alexandrov ChurchNativity2.JPG|thumb|right|240px|Cathedral of the Nativity\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Secular buildings===\nImage:Александров. Усадьба Первушина.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Pervushin's estate\n* \n* \nIn the city center, you will find further old buildings from 18th&amp;ndash;19th centuries (note the street names: Советская, Первомайская, Военная, Ленина, Революции, Красной Молодёжи). All of them are, however, unremarkable.\n\n===Museums===\n* \n| wikidata=Q4263814\n| content=The museum occupies the original wooden building where Anastasiya Tsvetaeva, a Russian writer, lived in 1915-1917. Her sister Marina Tsvetaeva, a famous poetess, visited this house and wrote some of her well-known poems here. The managers of the museum do their best to guide every visitor. In fact, visiting the museum without a guide is just impossible, because there are no exhibits to watch. The whole museum is an elegantly furnished room with photos on the walls and an imitation of the footbridge in the middle. The guide will readily tell you about the Tsvetaevas family and also show an exhibition \"Alexandrov &amp;ndash; the center of 101st kilometer\" about people who were prohibited to live in Moscow during the Soviet times and stayed in Alexandrov. The museum is a local cultural center: it hosts musical and poetical performances, books about Marina Tsvetaeva are also sold here. }}\n* \n* \nThe museums of Alexandrov are not very exciting. Artificial stones are really unusual, while the two other museums try to compensate the lack of exhibits by the intensive (and even useless) guidance. The reconstruction of the 19th century life is rather common for Russian museums and can be found elsewhere. To learn more about Marina Tsvetaeva, visit the museums in Moscow, Ivanovo, and Tarusa.\n* for each exhibition, about  for the whole museum\n| content=The museum includes seven basic exhibitions. Additionally, it offers a number of scenic \"interactive excursions\" that reconstruct the medieval atmosphere and show some old Russian traditions, however, in a very imitation way. \n}}\nAmong the exhibitions, you find\n** '''Palace of Ivan the Terrible''' &amp;ndash; the reconstruction of the prince palace.\n** '''Treasures from three centuries''' &amp;ndash; the collection of old books, icons, textile, and embroidery.\n** '''Tsar court in Alexandrova sloboda''' &amp;ndash; the history of the prince residence and oprichnina.\nThe must-see exhibition is one in the church of the Intercession (Tsar court in Alexandrova sloboda). Here you find the ivory carved throne of Ivan the Terrible and other original items from 16th century. You will also enter the church and watch the unique wall paintings inside the hip. Downstairs in the same building, one finds the original basement of the prince palace. Other exhibitions are fairly regular.\n\n==Do==\n* \n* \n* \n\n==Buy==\nIn the city center, you find two large food supermarkets:\n* '''Paterson''' (Патэрсон) &amp;ndash; Красный пер. 2 (open daily, 08:00&amp;ndash;22:00)\n* '''Pyatyorochka''' (Пятёрочка) &amp;ndash; ул. Ленина, 1\nNote also smaller shops at the following streets: Ленина, Советская, Революции.\n\n''Souvenirs'' are sold at Alexandrova sloboda: near the entrance and inside the convent.\n\n===Banks===\n* '''Moscow Industrial Bank''' &amp;ndash; Красный пер. 21\n* '''Sberbank''':\n** Октябрьская ул. 2\n** ул.

Free Wi-Fi.\n}}\n* \n* \n\nWhile there are many places to eat, finding a really nice place can be difficult. Locals will often advise going to the neighboring town of Strunino (Coza Nostra), because most of the restaurants of Alexandrov suffer from typical Russian problems (unfriendly waiters, loud music and drunk people during the evening hours). If you are not too hungry, try the '''Soviet union''' coffee house, which seems to follow reasonable standards of quality. For a fast food, '''cheburechnaya''' will perfectly suffice.\n\n==Drink==\nTry alcoholic drinks produced by the local factory.

The location is known for the monk's settlement (''Смоленско-Зосимова пустынь''), a 17th-century side settlement (''skit'') of the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius (Sergiev Posad). Arsaki keeps nice examples of red-brick churches in Russian revival style from late 19th century. The buildings belong to the church, but they are inside the military territory. Entering this territory requires an ID and is likely problematic for non-residents.\n** ''Get in:'' local trains to Moscow or Dmitrov (every hour).\n* '''Bol'shoe Karinskoe''' (Большое Каринское) &amp;ndash; the village 4&amp;nbsp;km south-west from Alexandrov (N56° 22.427', E38° 39.997'). The field near the village (''Каринское поле'') is a place of the battle between Russian and Polish troops in 1609, during the Time of Troubles. The monument commemorates this event.\n** ''Get in:'' buses and minibuses to Strunino (every hour). The bus should follow \"via Karinskoe\". There is an alternative route taking a different road.\n* '''Karabanovo''' (Карабаново) &amp;ndash; the unremarkable industrial town 10&amp;nbsp;km south from Alexandrov. The red-brick industrial building from early 20th century, the constructivist building  of the club, and the war memorial &amp;ndash; it is likely all to see here.\n** ''Get in:'' local trains to Kirzhach, buses or minibuses every 15–30 minutes.\n* '''Lizunovo''' (Лизуново) &amp;ndash; the village 20&amp;nbsp;km south-west from Alexandrov. The museum of Alexei Musatov, a Soviet writer.\n** ''Get in:'' no public transport.\n* '''Lukyantsevo''' (Лукьянцево) &amp;ndash; the village 15&amp;nbsp;km north from Alexandrov (N56.5045°, E38.7132°). The late 16th century monastery (''Свято-Лукианова мужская пустынь'') preserves three Russian-style buildings from late 17th &amp;ndash; early 18th century: ''church of the Nativity of the Theotokos'', ''church of the Epiphany'', and ''church of Ekaterina''.\n** ''Get in:'' three buses daily.\n* '''[http://www.stefmon.ru/ Mahra]''' (Махра) &amp;ndash; the ''convent of St. Trinity'' (Свято-Троицкий Стефано-Махрищский женский монастырь), 15&amp;nbsp;km south from Alexandrov (N56.2705°, E38.6804°). The convent dates back to 14th century, but most of the buildings were destroyed during the Soviet period. The original buildings are the baroque-style ''church of Sergiy Radonezhsky'' (over-the-gate) and the ''church of Peter and Paul'', both from late 18th century. You will also find a refectory building and living halls from late 19th century. The largest and the most impressive ''church of St. Stephan'' was rebuilt in 1997. The territory of the convent is well decorated and looks very picturesque during the summertime.\n** ''Get in:'' buses every two hours.\n* '''Strunino''' (Струнино) &amp;ndash; the unremarkable town 10&amp;nbsp;km west from Alexandrov. Note the pretty regular church of Transfiguration (1893-1898), the ravaged red-brick industrial building from early 20th century, and few buildings in constructivism style.\n** ''Get in:'' local trains to Moscow, buses every 20–30 minutes.\n\n===Further destinations===\n* '''Kirzhach''' &amp;ndash; the small town interesting for its 16th century monastery.\n* '''Kol'chugino''' &amp;ndash; one of the relatively new towns of the region. It lacks any important tourist attractions, yet the services (hotels and restaurants) may be useful.\n* '''Rostov Veliky''' &amp;ndash; one of the main destinations of the Golden Ring, the ancient town with numerous remarkable monuments.\n* '''Sergiev Posad''' &amp;ndash; the well-known destination with a huge ancient convent, one of the most important religious places in Russia.\n* '''Yuryev-Polsky''' &amp;ndash; the ancient town with a unique 13th century cathedral and sleepy provincial atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

If you are looking for fast paced resorts or a calm tranquil setting either is attainable. The entire region is around . Although the number of permanent residents is under 500,000 the area receives more than tenfold that in tourism each year. The busiest times of year tend to be July and August.\n\n=== History ===\nFollowing the neolithic period of the regions history, approximately 1000 BC, settlements and trading ports were established by the Phoenicians who were attracted by deposits of copper, manganese and iron. They came from the coastal regions of the eastern Mediterranean of modern-day Syria, Israel and Lebanon. Circa 550 BC Portimão was one of the ports founded by the Carthaginians who came from North Africa. In the 2nd century BC the region came under the control of the Romans as they spread throughout the Iberian Peninsular. Many Roman ruins still remain today throughout the Algarve and can be seen in many areas, but the best to visit are probably at the Milreu ruins,  from Faro, where buildings that started construction as a Roman villa later became a Christian Church.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Roman Empire, the Visigoths took control of the Algarve until the invasion of the Moors from North Africa in 711 AD. At this time, the Visigoths who came from central Europe, were defeated in the Battle of Guadalete by a force of invading Arabs and Berbers.\n\nThere followed a period of five centuries of Arab rule in Iberia. The Moors conquered the Algarve in 716. Faro, which had been called Santa Maria, was renamed Faraon, meaning 'the settlement of the Knights'. Even the name of the region owes its origin to the Moors who knew the region as 'al-gharb' meaning 'the west'. There is evidence of the moors throughout the Algarve  and Southern Spain, illustrated by chimney stacks, pottery and the Moorish style of architecture, and particularly, the Arabic castle at Silves. The castle was built by Almoravid Arabs in the 11th century out of red sandstone and dried mud and is the best preserved Moorish castle in the country. In the 12th century, King Afonso III, with a little help from English mercenaries, finally evicted the Moors and once again the Portuguese dominated the region, although the area was not fully secure from Moorish attacks until the middle of the 13th century.\n\nBorn in Porto in 1394, Prince Henry the Navigator based himself somewhere around Lagos/Sagres, and is considered to be responsible for many of the 'discoveries' made by the Portuguese in the middle ages sending out expeditions to Africa, the islands of Madeira and the Azores. In 1419 he was appointed governor of the province of the Algarve.\n\nDisaster struck on 1st November 1755, with a huge earthquake whose epicentre was reported to have been 200km South-West of the country and registering 9 on the Richter Scale. The coastal areas of the Algarve were devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. The devastation was not only limited to the Algarve, British naval reports from the period indicate the arrival of a huge wave in the port of Lisbon. The damage to Lisbon was almost total, and following huge political turmoil the person responsible for the reconstruction of the city was the Marquis of Pombal, the then Prime Minister.\n\n=== Climate ===\n&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\n}}\nThe Algarve's geographical position on Europe’s south-western tip in the south of Portugal gives it some special bioclimatic features. Although situated by the Atlantic Ocean, it has a temperate climate with Mediterranean characteristics, more than 3,000 hours of sunshine per year and a low annual average rainfall, mainly during the winter months. Even in the hottest days in July and August a mild breeze from the Atlantic provides relief.\n\nThe Serra in the northern half of the Algarve has a considerable influence on the climate of the region. It forms a physical barrier against the cold winds blowing from the north and the lows from the Northwest,  thus giving the Algarve coast an almost Mediterranean climate, with low annual rainfall and mild temperatures in winter. Furthermore, it is also a barrier for the misty winds that come from the South.\n\n===Visitor information===\n* \n==Talk==\nEnglish is in general used as a business language and is spoken in the tourist areas, where restaurant menus are multilingual. If you are travelling in the interior, then you would do well to carry a pocket dictionary with you, and have Wikivoyage's Portuguese phrasebook at hand. Also in case you unexpectedly have to deal with the police, English may not always be understood. You should be careful with any impolite comments – many Portuguese people have spent some time abroad and may understand you better than you think.\n\n==Get in==\n\nInternational flights into [https://www.ana.pt/en/fao/home '''Faro Airport'''] () then (1) by bus: national buses run from outside the airport to the bus terminal regularly throughout the day time on weekdays or (2) by taxi: will be under  from the airport to the train station.\n\n===By car===\nThe toll motorway A2 leads to the Algarve from the north. You will need to allow approximately 2 hours for the 240 km drive from Lisbon to the A22 north of Albufeira.\n\nFrom Spain the toll free A49 joins the A22 near Castro Marim in the Algarve after 145 km and about one and a half hours driving.\n\nIn the Algarve the toll motorway A22 ''Rua do Infante de Sagres'' goes from Lagos (Portugal)|Lagos in the west to Castro Marim in the east at the Spanish border. Toll tariffs on the A22 depend on the distance and are recorded electronically only. Since the toll was introduced at the end of 2011 the parallel route of the national road EN125 is quite busy during rush hours, because many locals shy away from using the A22 for cost reasons. Cars with a foreign number plate have several options to pay the toll collected by an electronic system on the A22 motorway:\n\n*'''Toll Card''': this card, valid for one year, can be charged with  and needs to be activated by SMS, entering the license number.\n*'''Toll Service''': you can have unlimited use of the A22 for 3 days after activation, for a one off fee of .\n*'''Easy Toll''': Payment by credit card (Visa or Master Card), with the toll directly deducted from your bank account\n*'''Via Verde Visitors''': renting a so called on board unit (OBU), a device that can be used both on roads with electronic or manual toll collection.\n\n===By plane===\n, the third largest in Portugal, is the main airport for the region.

A single ticket Seville-Faro costs  with [https://www.alsa.com/en ALSA] and the journey takes 2 hr. Flixbus also has a few connections per day for slightly higher prices.\n\n===By train===\nThere are several daily train connections to Algarve operated by [https://www.Cp.pt CP]. ''Alfa Pendular'' (''AP'') trains connect Porto and Lisbon with Faro twice (sometimes three times) a day, making several stops on the way, journey time is 5½ hr or 3 hr, respectively. ''Intercidades'' (''IC'') trains connect Lisbon with Faro as well, they stop at more places and are a bit slower than ''AP''. They run three times a day, journey time is 3½ hr. There is also one seasonal ''InterRegional'' (''IR)'' train.\n\nIn Tunes it is possible to change for ''Regional'' (''R)'' train to Lagos (Portugal)|Lagos, in Faro to Vila Real de Santo António.\n\n===By boat===\nThere is a ferry service between Vila Real de Santo António and Ayamonte (Spain). The ferry was once a main mean of transportation although after the construction of the Guadiana International Bridge it is nowadays mostly used by tourists. [http://www.navieraarmas.com/ Naviera Armas] operates a ferry to Portimão from Madeira (connecting with Gran Canaria) with a couple of departures per month.\n\n==Get around==\n===By train===\nThe Algarve Railway (''Linha do Algarve'') is a convenient possibility to get around Algarve. It connects Lagos (Portugal)|Lagos in the west with Vila Real de Santo António on the border with Spain, calling at most towns and cities along the way (Portimão, Silves, Tunes, Loulé, Faro, Tavira, etc.). There is no direct train between Lagos and Vila Real d/S/A. Operated are usually ''Regional'' trains, between Faro and Tunes also ''Alfa Pendular'', ''Intercidades'' and ''InterRegional'' trains. Journey from Faro to Lagos takes from 1h30min to 1h45min.\n\nThere is also one part of The Southern Railway (''Linha do Sul''; Lisbon - Tunes), although in Algarve are situated only two stops of this line - Messines-Alte and Tunes. These stations are served by ''Intercidades'' and ''InterRegional'' trains.\n\nAll trains are operated by [https://cp.pt CP].\n\n===By bus===\nRegional bus companies include [http://eva-bus.com/index.php?lang=uk '''Eva Transportes'''] and [http://www.frotazul-algarve.pt/ '''Frota Azul Algarve''']. [http://www.algarvebus.info Algarve Bus] website has a collection of bus information for Algarve region.\n\n===By car===\n\nA car is often the best way of seeing the Algarve, owing to the limited public transport services. Cars can be hired at Faro Airport and in other towns and cities in the Algarve. Most car rental companies will stipulate a minimum age of 21. Prices start from about  a day for a small car and there is often a wide range of cars to choose from.\n\nThe Algarve has a good network of roads, but be aware that some country roads are little more than dirt tracks. Roads are however generally well maintained, however, road markings may randomly disappear (in this case stick to the right as far as possible - a favourite Portuguese habit is to overtake, still they are mindful). After many years, the A22 (IP 1) motorway was finally completed in 2007, which goes from Bensafrim in the west all the way to Monte Francisco on the Portuguese/Spanish border. The Algarve, like the rest of Portugal and mainland Europe, drives on the right.\n\nPetrol stations are found all over the Algarve. All stations will sell standard unleaded (95 RON) and super (97 RON) and diesel. Some stations sell LPG (''GPL'') as well. Unleaded petrol is known as ''gasolina sem chumbo'' and diesel ''gasoleo''. Petrol prices in Portugal are high in comparison to other European countries; as of August 2009 a litre of 95 RON unleaded costs around  a litre, 97 RON super  a litre and diesel  a litre.\n\n==See==\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Do==\n* '''Beaches''' &amp;mdash; over 100 different beaches, each unique in its own way.

Most travellers come to Algeciras for its numerous ferry connections to Morocco and don't spend more than a few hours in the city. A shame, given the town's quiet charm.\n\n==Understand==\n\nThe north-south coastal road, Avenida de la Marina, is Algeciras's main artery. The '''tourist information office''' (''Calle Cervantes''), is well signed from this road.\n\n=== Orientation ===\nAlgeciras is on the Western side of Bahia de Algeciras (Algeciras Bay) virtually opposite Gibraltar. Roughly speaking, it is orientated north to south.  The Avenida Virgen del Carmen is the main road that runs along the water front.  The ferry port is about midway along the Abenida del Carmen: it can't really be missed as dozen of signs are pointing in its direction and there is constant ferry traffic in and out of the port.  There is also an elevated heliport right in front of the ferry port.\n\nThe main shopping streets, together with the town square and central market, are set back behind the Avenida Virgen del Carmen and are mainly pedestrianised.  There is a wide range of shops here, from local food shops and boutiques to the main brands.\n\nThe bus and railway stations are close together, about 300 m west (and slightly to the south) of the ferry port in the main town.\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By train===\nFrom Algeciras there are daily train connections to Madrid. Three a day on the very picturesque route to Ronda and Granada (Spain)|Granada.\n\nThe  is 300&amp;nbsp;metres west of the port entrance. Just walk outside the station and straight down Calle Cervantes (the street in front of you) until you reach the Avenida de la Marina. You will see signs from here to the port.\n\n===By bus===\nBuses to main Spanish cities, 10 connections daily to Malaga (2-3 hours, ). There is a ''free shuttle bus'' between Algeciras and Tarifa for Tangier-Tarifa ferry ticket holders, 40 min ride.\n\nThe  is just up the road from the tourist office, heading away from the port.\n\n===By boat===\nThe  is the heart of Algeciras and is well-signed from most roads in the city. Services from the following destinations arrive at the port:\n* Ceuta—daily services running about every hour from 08:00 - 22:15, 60-90 min trip, .\n* Tangier|Tangier Med—daily services running about every 90&amp;nbsp;minutes from 07:00-22:00. Fast ferries (40 minutes+ 20&amp;nbsp;minute free bus, ) and normal ferries (2½&amp;nbsp;hours, ) are available. Note that Port of Tanger Med is the commercial port of Tangier, about 30&amp;nbsp;km from Tangier, and is different from Port of Tangier, which is served from Tarifa, Spain. (The French spelling is Tanger, the English is Tangier.)\n*Tangier - fast ferry (high speed craft by [http://frs.es FRS] or Inter Shipping) between Tangier and Tarifa (not directly to Algeciras) running hourly, ticket €35-40, duration 35 min. There is a free shuttle bus leaving for Tarifa terminal from the ticket offices at Algeciras' harbour one hour before the corresponding ferry's departure.\n\nIf you are headed for the bus station, you have to leave the port and walk about 7&amp;nbsp;minutes up the hill (opposite of the ocean).\n\n==Get around==\n=== By bus ===\n*[http://www.algeciras.es/bus Local bus information]\n*[http://www.algeciras.es/opencms/export/sites/algeciras/.galleries/publicaciones/editorial/pub-movilidad-2017-lineas-y-paradas-bus.pdf Downloadable PDF of bus routes and frequency]\n\n==See==\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n* \n* \n* \n\n==Do==\nPlaces of natural interest include:\n*  park at the southernmost point of mainland Spain, and of mainland Europe, at the point where the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea meet in the Strait of Gibraltar, which places it on the migratory route for many birds.\n}}\n* \n* \n* \n\n==Buy==\n* \n* \n\n==Eat==\nYou'll find plenty of cheap bars, cafes and restaurants along the Avenida de la Marina, Calle Alfonso Once and around Plaza Alta.

Overlooked by many travellers, the country is bursting with beauty waiting to be discovered. From the bustling markets of Algiers to the pristine beaches of its Mediterranean coast, from the jaw-droppingly beautiful mountains of the north to the mesmerising deep reaches of the Sahara desert to the south, there is something for almost everyone to explore. Enjoy traditional cuisine, explore the ancient ruins, take in the breathtaking views, and then breathe in a world where few travellers tread. Algeria, and in particular Algerian hospitality, will leave a lasting impression on your heart and mind.\n\n==Regions==\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==Cities==\n*  (Arabic: '''الجزائر''') — The capital of Algeria, and the nation's political and cultural center. It is a vibrant and multicultural city, with a mix of French, Arab, and African influences. The city is well known for its beautiful architecture, stunning beaches, and lively nightlife. \n*  (Arabic: ''' عنّابة''') — a town with 200,000 inhabitants in the east of the country next to the border of Tunisia.\n*  (Arabic: '''باتنة''') — the main city and commune of Batna Province, Algeria. With a population of 340,000, it is the fifth largest city in Algeria. It is also one of the principal cities of the Chaoui area and is considered the capital of Aurès.\n*  (Arabic: '''بشار''') — small city in the Sahara, not far from the Moroccan border. \n*  (Arabic: '''قسنطينة''') — Algeria's 3rd largest city with a canyon going down through it. Also known as \"city of bridges\" for having a lot of impressive and beautiful bridges.\n*  (Arabic: '''وَهران''') — Algeria's 2nd largest city after Algiers, also called \"second Paris\" or \"Rai city \" by Algerians, with many impressive buildings from colonial times and also being popular for making quality rai songs\n*  (Arabic: '''سطيف''') — the trade capital of Algeria, Setif El-Ali (The High) is the capital of high plateaus, with quite moderate temperatures and occasional snow falls in the winter.\n*  (Arabic: '''تامنراست''') — largest town in the south and starting point for expeditions to the Sahara and the Hoggar Mountains.\n*  (Arabic: '''ﺗﻴﻤﻴﻤﻮن''') — a small Saharan oasis town which makes a good base for trips to the desert.\n\n==Other destinations==\n\n*  – Roman ruins\n* '''El-Oued''' with its domed architecture, and nearby '''Grand Erg Oriental''', the Sahara's second largest dune field\n* '''Hippo Regius''', 2 km south of Annaba, an ancient Numidian city and early center of Christianity with well preserved Roman baths and forum\n*  – fantastic architecture\n*  – a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Sahara desert\n*  – Roman ruins\n\n==Understand==\n\n\n=== Politics and government ===\nAlgeria is officially known as the '''People's Democratic Republic of Algeria'''. Although the term \"People's Republic\" is commonly associated with communist states, Algeria is not a communist country. The term was adopted primarily because Algeria gained its independence through a revolutionary struggle against France.\n\nAlgeria is a multi-party republic with a strong executive branch led by a president. The president is both the head of state and the commander in chief of the army, and is elected by popular vote for a five-year term. \n\nLegislative power is vested in the two chambers of Parliament, the Council of the Nation and the People's National Assembly.\n\n=== Name transcriptions ===\n* Arabic: الجمهورية الجزائرية الديمقراطية الشعبية, ''al-Jumhūriyya al-Jazāʾiriyya ad-Dīmuqrāṭiyya aš-Šaʿbiyya''\n\n* Berber phrasebook|Berber: ⵜⴰⴳⴷⵓⴷⴰ ⵜⴰⵎⴳⴷⴰⵢⵜ ⵜⴰⵖⵔⴼⴰⵏⵜ ⵜⴰⴷⵣⴰⵢⵔⵉⵢⵜ, ''Tagduda tamegdayt taɣerfant tazzayrit''\n\n* French: République algérienne démocratique et populaire (''lit'', Democratic and Popular Algerian Republic)\n\n=== Geography ===\nAlgeria covers an area of , making it the world's tenth-largest country and the largest country in Africa. It is slightly larger than Mexico, four times smaller than the United States, and nearly 200 times larger than Africa's smallest country, Gambia. \n\nAlgeria is made up of 58 provinces and more than 1,541 communes.\n\n=== History ===\n\n==== Early history ====\nThe history of Algeria can be traced back to the earliest civilisations that inhabited the region and beyond. The earliest known inhabitants of Algeria were the Berber people, who have inhabited the region since at least 10,000 BCE. From the 8th century BCE, Phoenician traders established trading posts along the North African coast, introducing the region to the wider Mediterranean world.\n\nIn the 7th century CE, Algeria was conquered by the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate and subsequently came under the rule of various Muslim dynasties. The region was colonised by the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century and remained under Ottoman control until 1830. \n\n==== French Algeria (1830-1962) ====\nFrench rule in Algeria began in 1830 when France invaded the region, defeated the Ottoman forces, and established a colonial administration. Algeria was formally annexed and split into French departments in 1848.\n\nFrench authorities introduced a number of reforms, such as land reform, the secularisation of education, and the introduction of new laws and infrastructure. However, these policies were often accompanied by oppressive measures such as forced labor, restrictions on religious expression, and the suppression of opposition.\n\nAlgerians were treated very poorly by the French. Algerians were subjected to oppressive laws, such as the Code de l'indigénat, which denied them basic rights and freedoms. They were heavily taxed, forcibly conscripted into the French military, and stripped of their land and resources. Algerians were also subjected to violence, torture, and other forms of mistreatment by French colonial authorities.\n\n==== The Algerian War (1954-1962) ====\nThe Algerian War for Independence was a bloody eight-year conflict between the French colonial government in Algeria and the National Liberation Front (FLN), a nationalist movement that sought to end French rule and establish an independent Algerian state. The war lasted from 1954 to 1962 and resulted in the death of over 1 million people, the displacement of over 5 million people, and the eventual independence of Algeria as a nation.\n\nThe Algerian War for Independence began on November 1, 1954, when the FLN launched a series of attacks against French military and police outposts throughout Algeria. The FLN hoped to spark a popular uprising against French rule, and the attacks were largely successful. The French responded with a massive campaign of repression, employing torture, summary executions, and collective punishments against the population.\n\nThe war soon escalated, with the FLN launching guerrilla attacks against French forces, while the French launched counter-insurgency operations that included the use of napalm and other forms of indiscriminate violence. The war was also characterized by atrocities on both sides, including the massacre of civilians by French forces and the use of torture by the FLN.\n\nThe war ended in 1962, when the French agreed to a cease-fire and granted Algeria its independence. After declaring independence in 1962, Algeria underwent a period of political turbulence.\n\n==== Post-war period (1962-1991) ====\nImmediately following independence, the FLN assumed power and established a single-party government. Under the leadership of President Houari Boumediene, Algeria adopted a socialist economic system and sought to strengthen ties with other Arab and African countries. \n\nIn the late 1970s, Algeria’s economic situation deteriorated and the government’s popularity declined. In response, the government began to crack down on political dissent and religious expression, leading to an Islamist insurgency.\n\n==== Algerian Civil War (1991-2002) ====\nThe Algerian Civil War was a brutal conflict that caused great suffering to the Algerian people. Over 200,000 people lost their lives in the war, and more than 1 million were displaced. The conflict also had a lasting effect on Algeria's economy and society, as the country struggled to rebuild after the war. Although the conflict officially ended in 2002, its legacy continues to shape the country today.\n\nThe conflict began with the cancellation of the 1992 general elections, which saw the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) poised to win a majority of seats in the National Assembly. The Algerian government, a military-backed regime, responded by banning the FIS and arresting its members, sparking a long and bloody conflict.\n\nThe war was fought between the government and various rebel groups, most notably the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) and the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS). The GIA initially sought to overthrow the government and impose an Islamic state. As the conflict progressed, however, they became increasingly brutal and indiscriminate in their tactics, leading to a sharp decline in popular support. The AIS, on the other hand, sought to negotiate with the government for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n\nThroughout the war, the government employed a range of tactics to combat the rebels. These included a massive deployment of troops, aerial bombardments, and the use of torture and other forms of human rights abuses. The government also sought to co-opt the population by providing economic incentives and social services, such as free health care and education.\n\n==== Present history (2002 - present) ====\nSince the end of the civil war, Algeria has experienced an economic boom due to increased oil and gas production. This has led to a marked reduction in poverty and unemployment. \n\nIn 2006, the Algerian government approved a new constitution, which aimed to protect human rights and improve the country’s political and economic situation. This resulted in a period of political reform, as well as an increase in foreign investment.\n\nDespite its economic progress, Algeria is still facing several challenges. These include high unemployment, poverty, and corruption. The country is also struggling with terrorism, with attacks by extremist groups such as Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/ISIS/IS).\n\n===Electricity===\nOfficially, 220 V 50&amp;nbsp;Hz. Outlets are the European standard CEE-7/7 \"Schukostecker\" or \"Schuko\", or the compatible, but not always grounded, CEE-7/16 \"Europlug\" types. Canadian and US travellers should pack an adapter for these outlets if they plan to use North American electrical equipment in Algeria.\n&lt;br clear=\"right\" /&gt;\n\n==Get in==\n\n\nAlgeria is not a country you can just show up to and get in; most visitors require a visa to visit the country and the government hasn't exactly opened up the country to the rest of the world. \n\n===Visa requirements===\n[[File:Visa policy of Algeria.svg|thumb|375px|Visa policy of Algeria \n\n]]\nCitizens of Libya, Malaysia, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Western Sahara, Seychelles, and Tunisia can enter the country without a visa. \n\nIf you're not a citizen of any of the countries listed above, you are required to apply for an Algerian visa at an Algerian diplomatic mission. \n\nObtaining an Algerian visa can be challenging, as the process often involves heaps of paperwork and high fees. For example, the Algerian Embassy in the United States usually charges '''US$160''' for any kind of Algerian visa and the Algerian consulate in Alicante charges '''€95''' for visas for Spanish citizens staying up to 90 days. \n\nAs a general rule of thumb, the longer you intend to stay, the more expensive the visa will be. \n\n==== Visa application requirements ====\n\n\nAn Algerian diplomatic mission can be found in almost every country. If your country does not have an Algerian diplomatic mission, you may need to travel to another country to apply for an Algerian visa.\n\nAlthough visa requirements vary from country to country, you're typically asked to submit the following to apply for an Algerian visa: \n* A copy of your passport (must have a validity of more than six months) \n* Two passport-sized photographs.\n* Two visa application forms. \n* A notarized letter of invitation (required if you plan to stay in the home of an Algerian resident)\n* A copy of your travel itinerary.\n* A copy of your hotel reservation.\n* A copy of your bank statement.\n\n===== Special requirements =====\n* Citizens of Syria must demonstrate they have enough funds ( if they've been sponsored or  if they have no sponsor) to cover their stay in Algeria.\n\n===By plane===\nMost visitors normally enter Algeria by plane.\n\nThe main international airport and point of entry in Algeria is '''Houari Boumediene Airport''' (), which is situated in Algiers, the capital city. The airport is well-served by intercontinental flights.\n\n===By train===\nThe Algerian train company is named [http://www.sntf.dz/ SNTF] and tickets can be bought at train stations. On-line booking does not appear to be possible any more; timetables are subject to changes; the best way is to ask at the train station. The network in the north is dense. You can reach Algeria by train from Tunisia, although you will have to change trains at the border post. All border points with Morocco are closed.\n\nIf you can, try to catch the newer trains as they are more comfortable and climate-controlled.\n\n===By car===\n\nAlgeria shares borders with six countries: Tunisia, Libya, Niger, Mali, Mauritania, and Morocco. \n\n==== From Tunisia ====\nDriving into Algeria from Tunisia is the safest option. \n\n==== From Morocco ====\nThe Algerian-Moroccan border has been closed since 1994 and will remain closed for the foreseeable future. \n\nIf you like, you're more than welcome to visit settlements along the border.\n\n==== From Libya ====\nThe poor security situation in Saharan Algeria, the risk of terrorism, and the fluid security and political situation in Libya make the Algerian-Libyan border insecure, and the two border posts have been closed since 2011. It is not possible to legally cross from Algeria to Libya by land.\n\n==== From Mauritania====\nThere is one, new official border crossing (opened February 2024) near Tindouf, which at least some people have had success crossing. \n\n==== From Mali====\nThe poor security situation in Saharan Algeria, the risk of terrorism, and the unstable political situation in Mali make the Algerian-Malian border incredibly insecure, and it is unlikely foreign tourists would be able to get anywhere close to the border, let alone cross it legally. \n\n==== From Niger====\nThe poor security situation in Saharan Algeria, the risk of terrorism, and the unstable political situation in Niger make the Algerian-Nigerien border incredibly insecure, and it is unlikely foreign tourists would be able to get anywhere close to the border, let alone cross it legally. \n\n===By boat===\nThe prices aren't usually cheaper than flying so if you can and have no car nor any huge amount of baggage, take a plane. Most connections are offered by [http://algerieferries.dz/ Algérie Ferries].\n\nFrom Spain:\n* Alicante to Algiers and Oran\n* Almeria to Ghazaouet and Oran\n* Barcelona to Algiers\n* Valencia to Mostaganem\n\nFrom France:\n\nMarseille to\n\n* Algiers\n* Bejaia\n* Oran\n* Skikda\n\nFrom Italy:\n* Napoli to Tunis &amp; take a road for 1&amp;nbsp;hour\n* Roma (Civitavecchia) to Tunis &amp; take a road for 1&amp;nbsp;hour\n\n==Get around==\nWith an area of , travelling between major cities in Algeria can take ''a lot'' of time and can be dangerous if you don't know what you're doing. \n\n===By plane===\nDue to the country's immense geography, the uncertain security situation, and the lack of adequately developed infrastructure, the most convenient way of getting around the country is by plane. \n\nAlgeria has a very small airlines industry ― only four airline companies operate in the country ― and all the airline companies are owned by the government. \n\nThe two main airline companies are as follows:\n\n* '''[https://airalgerie.dz/ Air Algérie]''' is Algeria's national carrier and offers flights to almost any Algerian city. The airline uses Houari Boumediene Airport as its hub.\n\n* '''[https://www.tassiliairlines.dz/ Tassili Airlines]''', like Air Algérie, uses Houari Boumediene Airport as its hub and will take you all over Algeria. It is a subsidiary of Sonatrach, the largest company in Africa and one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world.\n\n===By taxi===\nIt's usual to take a taxi to travel near or in cities. The prices are pretty moderate but when travelling between bigger cities with large distances taxis are the same or more expensive as flying. Try to avoid unofficial taxis since it's very likely the driver will rip you off. Most taxis have no taximeter so arrange a price in advance. Many drivers will try to take advantage of your lack of knowledge but never pay more than DA30 per km regardless of what you are told. Tipping is not necessary but you can round up to the next DA10.\n\nUber doesn't operate in Algeria, but a similar app named Yassir does.\n\n===By car===\nImage:Mzab Ghardaïa.jpg|thumb|[[M'zab architecture]]\nThe road network is well developed in the north. The Algerian government has made much improvements regarding road building; new highways were built to replace the older roads. The most important highway is the 1200&amp;nbsp;km long '''N1 (Route est-ouest)''' from Annaba to Oran, almost all bigger cities in the north are connected to this highway including Algiers.\n\nA car is not absolutely necessary because of the well run public transportation system, but could be sometimes useful to reach more remote areas. Keep in mind that the driving habits of the locals are completely different compared to those of Europeans and that driving rules and prohibitive signs are more seen as guidelines, even by the police! It would be a wise decision letting a local Algerian do the driving for you in the first few days to get an impression of the driving style. If this is not possible it's recommended to stay on the highways.\n\n''Do not'' try to reach the Saharan areas with a car other than a 4x4: occasional dunes on the roads and extreme temperature changes will offer a challenge for the driver and the car.\n\nAs of 2018, fuel did not cost more than DA50 a liter.\n\n===By train===\n\nAlgerian railways are operated by '''[http://www.sntf.dz SNTF]'''; the trains and lines are being modernised. Ten comfortable high-speed trains named Autorail were bought, and two of them are in operation. Though the website is useful for checking times etc, tickets can not be bought online, only at the train stations. Prices are quite moderate but more expensive than buses or taxis, but in return you will have more comfort and enjoy wonderful landscapes.\n\n'''Main routes''':\n\n* '''Algiers''' to '''Oran''', five daily departures from '''Agha''' Station, this journey takes 4-5&amp;nbsp;hours, ''2nd Class: DA900-1130, 1st Class: DA1200-1530.''\n* '''Algiers''' to '''Annaba''', departing each evening at 19:40 and arriving in Annaba (via Constantine) at 05:38 the following morning. ''2nd Class: DA900, 1st Class: DA1270.''\n* '''Algiers''' to '''Constantine''' as above\n'''Other routes''':\n*'''Algiers to Touggourt,''' departing daily at 18:10, arriving in Touggourt at 05:00 the following morning. ''2nd Class: DA1500, 1st Class: DA2005.''\n*'''Oran''' to '''Bechar''', two daily departures. A daytime train leaves Oran at 10:20, while the night-train leaves at 20:30. ''2nd Class: DA975, 1st Class:  DA1370.''\n*'''Annaba''' to '''Tebessa''', leaving Annaba at 16:40 and arriving in Tebessa at 21:49. ''2nd Class: DA255, 1st Class: DA360.''\n\n=== By tram ===\nAlgeria has one of the most developed tram networks in all of Africa. As of 2023, there are tram networks in six major cities: Algiers, Oran, Constantine, Sidi Bel Abbes, Ouargla, and Setif. \n\nThe agency responible for the operation and maintenance of the tram network is '''[https://www.setram.dz/fr/accueil Société d'exploitation des tramways (SETRAM)]'''.\n\nGetting around Algeria by tram is remarkably economical; a ticket typically costs . You may buy a ticket at a designated tram kiosk and you can get all the information you need at a tram kiosk. \n\n'''Overview of the tram system in Algeria:'''\n* Algiers: 23 kilometres long and has 37 stops.\n* Oran: 32 kilometres long and has 19 stops.\n* Constantine: 18 kilometres long and has 21 stops.\n* Sidi Bel Abbès: 14 kilometres long and has 22 stops.\n* Ouargla: 10 kilometres long and has 16 stops.\n* Setif: 15 kilometres long and has 26 stops.\n\n=== By cable car ===\nDue to its highly mountainous and massive geography, Algeria has an extensive cable car network.\n\n==See==\n\n\nAlgeria is brimming with hidden treasures, offering a wealth of sites for the brave and curious. \n\n=== Ancient ruins ===\nAlgeria, much like neighbouring Libya, takes pride in its remarkable ancient ruins. Step back in time and explore the remnants of the Phoenician, Roman, and Byzantine civilizations that have left an indelible mark on this land.

Marvel at the archaeological site, which includes a theater, amphitheater, basilica, and captivating views of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n=== Saharan desert ===\nAlgeria's greatest tourist possibilities lie in the '''Sahara'''; there's no other place on Earth that can offer the same level of awe-inspiring experiences in this vast desert landscape. \n\nThe crown jewel of these adventures lies within the '''M'zab|M'zab Valley''', the epicenter of Mozabite culture. Prepare to be captivated by the five interconnected cities that form a breathtaking architectural playground, reminiscent of modern cubist and surrealist art. These cities are not just places to see, but experiences to be lived, leaving an indelible impression on your journey.\n\nMarvel at the harsh yet majestic Saharan Atlas mountains, their rugged peaks standing as a testament to the forces of nature. Traverse the endless expanse of the desert and explore the towering Hoggar Mountains surrounding the desert capital of '''Tamanrasset'''. \n\nFeel the thrill of adventure as you encounter the vast dune field of the Grand Erg Oriental at '''El-Oued''', an otherworldly landscape that will leave you in awe.\n\nUncover Algeria's ancient history etched in stone as you discover the remarkable rock carvings of '''Djelfa''' and the Saharan National Park of '''Tassili N'Ajjer'''. These extraordinary sites showcase a treasure trove of prehistoric art, transporting you back in time and connecting you with the rich cultural heritage of the region.\n\n=== Major cities ===\nWhile Algeria's major cities may not boast the same level of tourist attractions as its exotic locales, they offer a unique perspective on the country's modern culture, Islamic heritage, and colonial legacy. Prepare to be pleasantly surprised by the lesser-known treasures that lie within.\n* '''Algiers''', the renowned White City, may not be as heavily touristic as one would expect, considering its pivotal role in Algeria's economic, political, and cultural life. Nevertheless, as all visitors pass through Algiers, exploring the historic seventeenth-century center known as the Casbah is a must. Wander through its labyrinthine streets, immerse yourself in the vibrant atmosphere, and witness the blend of influences from various civilizations.\n* '''Oran''', the country's second-largest city, boasts a captivating blend of modernity and historical charm.

Experience the vibrant marine life with beautiful fish, enchanting sea plants, and an array of stunning shells. The shores offer a variety of sands, from yellow and white to black. Whether you enjoy fishing, swimming, or simply basking in the beauty of a breathtaking sunset, Algeria's beaches have it all. The Turquoise Coast in Oran stands out as one of the country's finest beach destinations, perfect for relaxation. Annaba, Skikda, and Ghazaouet also offer beautiful coastal spots. For visitors near Algiers, the resort town of Sidi Fredj is an undeniable gem.\n\n=== National parks ===\n\nAlgeria is more than just a barren, flat, hot desert country. The country boasts an array of beautiful national parks brimming with natural beauty.\n\n==Do==\nAlgeria is full of Roman ruins &amp; 10th-century desert towns.\nSome of which are:\n*Tassili N'Ajjer National park: A national park in southern Algeria with tons of cave arts and dramatic sandstone formation.\n*Monument of the martyrs: Iconic monument honoring independence, the people who died for the country, and veterans.\n*The church of Nôtre Dame of Africa: a Catholic church with dramatic views in Oran\n*Hamma scientific Experiments Park: gracious 19th-century botanical gardens.\n*Fortaliza de Santa Cruz: mountaintop fort with scenic city views.\n*Ketchaoua Mosque: grand mosque build in 17th-Century.\n*Royal Mausoleum of Mauritania: Likely a tomb of an Egyptian princess in Tipaza, Algeria. \n*Grand mosque of Algeria: Minarets viewing platform and a huge hall.\n*Tikja: Winter ski resort with hiking in the summer.

Many Algerians are multilingual.\n\n'''Algerian Arabic phrasebook|Algerian Arabic''' (also known as '''Darja'''), the local vernacular, is spoken natively by about 75-80% of the population. Algerian Arabic is often considered to be more difficult than other dialects due to its unique features and regional variations. The dialect is used primarily in informal and spoken communication and is not typically used for formal or written communication. If you don't know the local dialect, do not despair; all Algerians learn '''Modern Standard Arabic''' at school, so you should have no problems communicating in major cities.\n\nAlgerian Arabic has a lot of similarities with other Maghrebi dialects, including Tunisian and Moroccan Arabic. If you have some knowledge of '''Moroccan Arabic phrasebook|Moroccan Arabic''', you should have no problems getting by since Moroccan and Algerian Arabic are, to a significant extent, mutually intelligible. \n\nMany Algerians who were born during French colonial rule (prior to the 1960s) are unable to read or write Arabic.\n\n'''Kabyle''' is the most commonly spoken Berber language and is primarily spoken in cities such as Bejaia, Bouira, and Boumerdes. Berber was made an official language after major protests in 2002, and the language is taught in Algerian schools. \n\n'''French phrasebook|French''', although it has no official status, has been referred to as the \"lingua franca\" of Algeria. It is taught in Algerian schools from an early age, and it is widely used in everyday business. French is often used to transliterate Arabic words. For example, the name Yasin is transliterated as Yacine. Although many Algerians are competent in French, particularly those older than 35, many Algerians consider the language as a painful reminder of French colonial rule and in schools it is being deprioritized by the government in favor of English. However, this trend is reversed in Kabyle areas, where French is still widely spoken, including by younger people, and people will be happier to hear French than they will to hear Arabic, since in Kabyle areas, Arabic is seen as the \"oppressor's language\". Regardless of whether you speak French or Arabic in the \"wrong\" place, if you are a foreign tourist, people will be welcoming regardless of whether you are speaking a \"culturally negative\" language. \n\n'''English''' is gradually gaining popularity as a preferred language for learning, although a significant majority of Algerians have limited to no knowledge of it. Highly educated Algerians may be competent in English. The Algerian government is actively promoting the language, but some, including politicians in France, see this as an attempt to diminish French influence in the country.\n\n==Buy==\n===Money===\n.}}\n\n\n\n\nAlgerian currency is the '''Algerian dinar''', denoted by the symbol \"'''د.ج'''\" or \"'''DA'''\" (ISO code: '''DZD'''). There are coins of DA5, DA10, DA20, DA50, DA100 and DA200. Banknotes are issued in denominations of DA100, DA200, DA500, DA1,000 and DA2,000. \n\nMoney can be exchanged at banks or post offices. Make sure the exchanged bills are in good condition; people tend to be picky with accepting ripped and older bills. Be careful with currencies other than euros or US dollars: finding a bank that exchanges less common currencies could be complicated.\n\nA better exchange rate can usually be found by exchanging money through unofficial money changers on street corners. There are locations where this is a widespread practice. The exchange rate offered is generally better than the official rate. It seems to be a very safe practice and is often done in view of police, who don't seem concerned.\n\nATMs are widely available and can be found in every post office or larger bank where you can withdraw Algerian dinar with any major credit card and Maestro cards. If a pin with six numbers is necessary, enter two zeros before your pin.\n\nMany Algerian-branded ATMs don't work for foreign cards (even when showing that they support Mastercard or Visa). You may have luck with Societé Générale ATMs.\n\nGenerally speaking, Algeria is very cash-based, and most establishments won't accept credit cards. Some hotels do (in particular larger establishments), but many don't. Bringing an ample supply of Euros or US dollars in cash can result in much cheaper travel by taking advantage of the much better exchange rates offered by the unofficial exchange market, as mentioned above.\n\nAlthough the Algerian dinar has had a relatively stable exchange rate with the Euro and Dollars for the past 10 years, there still exists a significant parallel (\"black\") currency exchange market. Parallel exchange rates in between August 2018 and 2024 have remained around DA215-DA240 to the euro at the parallel market versus around DA145 at the official Forex market rate. Thus, travellers willing to exchange euros will be roughly 50% more purchasing power. The parallel market is ''de facto'' permitted in Algeria despite being ''de jure'' illegal. You will not find normal exchange houses, not even at the airport. For instance, the main square for parallel currency exchange in downtown Algiers is done fully under the eyes of a heavy police presence, ensuring safety in the location despite the large volumes of cash changing hands in public. \n\n===Costs===\nAlgeria is a remarkably economical country; an underground metro ticket normally costs  and the monthly rent for an apartment, depending on the area, is between  per month.\n\n will get you a full meal or a bus ride from one major city to another.\n\n==Eat==\n\n\nAlgerian cuisine is a mix of Mediterranean and North African flavors, with a strong French influence. Algerian cuisine is full of flavorful dishes such as tagines, couscous, and pastilla. Despite its rich flavors and vibrant ingredients, Algerian cuisine is not as widely known or appreciated as other Mediterranean or North African cuisines. Still, that shouldn't stop you from fully experiencing Algerian gastronomy.\n\n* Fettate (Sahara speciality, in Tamanrasset)\n* Taguella (bread of sand, a nomad speciality)\n* Couscous (steamed semolina with sauce containing meat and/or potatoes, carrots, courgette, and chick peas)\n* Buseluf (cooked lambs head)\n* Dowara (stew of stomach and intestines with courgette &amp; chick peas)\n* Chorba (a meaty soup)\n* Rechta (hand made spaghetti, usually served with a clear chicken broth, potatoes &amp; chick peas)\n* Chakchouka (normally, it has green peppers, onions and tomatoes; egg may be added)\n* Mechoui (charcoal grilled lamb)\n* Algerian pizza\n* Tajine (stew)\n* Mhadjeb (A dish which is a kind of flaky pancake made from semolina traditionally stuffed with onion, tomatoes, garlic, pepper, and spices)\n\n'''Desserts and snacks'''\n* Qalb El Louz (Sweet dessert made from layers of buttery semolina and ground almonds. Flavoured with orange blossom and a honey syrup, it is bursting with flavours and summery aromas. Each slice is topped with a whole almond for a lovely crunch.)\n* Baklawa (Almond cake consists of many layers of very thin dough carefully hand crafted and drenched in honey)\n* Ktayef (A kind of baked vermicelli, filled with almonds and drenched in sugar, syrup, and honey)\n\n==Drink==\n\nAlgeria produces a selection of wine (not in big volume) and also beer. Algeria was once famous for its high quality wines.  The new production is also of very high quality, particularly the red wine.  Locally produced beer is also of a very high standard.  Algeria is a majority Muslim country, so you do not find alcohol sold everywhere, but it is not hard to find it. Wine and alcoholic drinks are sold in the few bar restaurants in the big cities, better hotels, and night clubs. Some bar/restaurants can be found in nice parks, so if you are in a nice wooded park, look for the restaurants. The fast food restaurants that are open and affordable to the public do not sell beer, and the coffee shops do not sell alcohol. If you visit Algiers or coastal cities, there are fish restaurants in almost every fishing port, the fishing is traditional and the fish sold is very fresh; usually, these restaurants sell alcohol but you have to ask (do not expect to see it, some times it is on the menu, some times not).\n\nFinally, you can buy your own bottle of Algerian wine to take home in discreet shops that sell alcoholic drinks. It is better to buy it at the Algiers airport, though expect to pay  per bottle. In smaller towns, buying alcoholic drinks can be challenging; you usually find them at the edge of the towns in sketchy areas and the conditions in which the alcohol was kept are sometimes questionable. Some Muslims drink but they consider it a sin. It is in private but socially. If someone invites you into his home and does not offer alcohol, he expects you not to be drunk or smell of alcohol, and does not expect you to bring your own bottle or even discuss drinking alcohol in front of his wife and children.\n\n'''Non-alcoholic'''\n* Mediterranean juices (grenadine, orange)\n* Very sweet green tea\n* Strong coffee\n\n==Sleep==\nFinding suitable accommodation in Algeria is not a challenging task, as the country offers a wide range of housing options, including luxury hotels and budget-friendly alternatives. For those seeking a luxurious experience, beautiful deluxe rooms for couples are available at prices ranging from  per day. Conversely, low-budget tourists can find rooms priced as low as  per day. Luxury hotels provide an array of services, including cafeterias, bars, restaurants, nightclubs, and pools, ensuring a delightful stay.\n\nDuring the summer season, which spans from June 15 to August 31, many property owners rent out houses and cottages along the Mediterranean Sea, particularly in the area from Port Say (Marsa Ben M'hidi) to El-Kala. Prices for these rentals vary depending on the number of rooms, usually ranging from   per month, inclusive of electricity. It is advisable to make advance reservations through acquaintances or travel agencies to secure the desired accommodation. Additionally, many Algerians utilise internet ads for housing rentals, although it is recommended to send a trusted individual to inspect the property before making any payments, as some offers may appear attractive but prove to be deceptive.\n\nAnother notable attraction is the Meskoutine Hammam complex, which offers various amenities such as spas, pools, and more. Situated near a mesmerizing waterfall that boasts a natural hot water source with a temperature of 98 °C (208 °F), this site holds the distinction of being the second most sought-after hot spring in the world, surpassed only by the geyser in Iceland. The prices for bungalows in this complex vary depending on the number of rooms, typically ranging from  per day.\n\nUnder current Algerian laws, non-Algerians are '''not allowed''' to purchase real estate in Algeria.\n\n==Learn==\nAlthough education is free and mandatory for Algerians aged 6 to 15, the Algerian educational system has been criticised for being poorly maintained. Very few travellers, if any, take advantage of learning opportunities in the country. Unless you're fluent in either Arabic, French, or both, learning opportunities in Algeria are unlikely to be of interest to you. \n\nThe oldest and most prestigious university in the country is the '''[https://www.univ-alger.dz/?lang=en University of Algiers]'''.\n\n==Work==\n outbreak.]]\nEmployment opportunities in Algeria are '''limited''' and rates of pay are low. A lack of economic diversification, a poor educational system, rigid labour conditions, a high dependence on oil and gas revenues, and restrictive regulations on foreign investment all contribute to the country's poor labour market. Successive Algerian governments have done little to create enough employment opportunities for people. \n\nOne seldom manages life in the country effectively without knowing either Arabic, French, or both, so try to acquire the necessary language skills. Doing so will open many doors for you. \n\nThe largest employer in Algeria is the Algerian government and the government employs 30-40% of the Algerian workforce. If you manage to secure employment in Algeria, there's a ''good chance'' you might end up working for the Algerian government because the government has controlling stakes in many Algerian companies. \n\nAlgerian companies are hierarchical and there are set expectations for both senior managers and junior employees. Senior managers are generally expected to be decisive and demonstrate leadership qualities, and junior employees are generally expected to follow their superiors at all times.\n\nWhile being a foreigner puts you at an advantage (Algerians generally trust foreign skills more than local skills), the importance of doing things the \"Algerian way\" ''cannot be overstated''. Taking too much time to make a decision, showing no interest in doing tasks, not having good morals, not greeting superiors properly, and openly disagreeing with your superiors will undoubtedly distance you from people. \n\nIt is not unusual for Algerians to hire their close friends and family members. Algerians do not see this as an unfair practice; rather, they consider it gratifying to help others in need. \n\nThe working week typically runs from Sunday to Thursday. Friday and Saturday are rest days. \n\nThe Algerian authorities do not take too kindly to people abusing Algerian immigration laws; a lot of migrants from West Africa and the Sahel often try to enter Algeria illegally (without any paperwork and documentation) in search of better opportunities in Algeria. Many of these migrants work as labourers. Given Algeria's proximity to Europe, some migrants try to enter Europe.\n\n==Stay safe==\n\n\nDo not travel to or in Saharan Algeria overland if you have no experience with driving in desert areas or knowledge of Algerian roads. The area is sparsely populated (which means help is limited), and you can get lost easily if you don't know what you're doing. For this reason, access the area by plane. \n\nDo not travel after nightfall; travel by plane if you can, instead of by car; travel with public transports; avoid minor roads; ask the police or gendarmes if you are unsure about your surroundings. Check the travel advice on the Australian, Canadian, Irish and New Zealand government websites.\n\nTravel is heavily discouraged for Jews, as antisemitism is ubiquitous in Algeria. Do not speak about any aspects of Judaism or Israel, and if you do happen to be Jewish, don't reveal it.\n\n=== Political unrest ===\nSince gaining independence in 1962, Algeria has experienced a long history of political instability. Anti-government protests and demonstrations are not uncommon, and they can turn violent pretty quickly. \n\n'''Do not''' take part in political protests or make strongly worded comments against the government on social media; people, including dual citizens of Algeria, have been prevented from leaving the country for doing that. \n\nBe vigilant and aware of your surroundings; if you see any signs of a protest or disturbance, you should leave the area immediately and seek a safe place.  \n\nIt is strongly recommended that you monitor and listen to local media during your stay in Algeria.\n\n=== Extreme weather ===\n\n90% of the country is covered by the Sahara desert. Algeria is a very hot country and temperatures can go as high as . Be sure to hydrate often and wear appropriate clothing to deal with the heat.\n\n=== Terrorism and banditry ===\nAreas near the borders with Niger, Mali, and Mauritania are unsafe due to general lawlessness. Generally speaking, tourists have little or no reason to go to those areas as they have nothing that interests tourists. The exception to this is the Tadrart Rouge, which is on near the border with Niger but which is safe for travel. Note that although the security situation in Libya has significantly improved in the past few years, the two border crossings with Libya and Algeria, at Ghat and Ghadames, remain closed for the foreseeable future (updated Jul 2024). \n\n=== Antiquities ===\nAlgeria has strict laws concerning the export of antiquities. If you buy a souvenir that looks old or antiquated, try to obtain the necessary documentation for it. Better to be safe than sorry. Not doing so will land you in serious trouble with the Algerian authorities.\n\n===Photography===\nAlgeria may be replete with wonderful photo opportunities, but you should steer clear of photographing government buildings, security installations, or military/law enforcement personnel.\n\n=== LGBT travellers ===\nAs is the case throughout the Arab world and the Middle East, homosexuality is ''frowned upon'' by the vast majority of Algerians. Open display of such orientations may result in open contempt and possible violence.\n\n=== Racism ===\nAlgeria is, to a significant extent, a welcoming country. Hospitality is a cornerstone of Algerian culture, and Algerians consider it shameful not to give a guest a warm welcome.\n\nThis being said, Black-skinned people may be incorrectly assumed to be migrants from the Sahel and may attract unwanted attention from the authorities.\n\n=== Algerian dual citizens ===\nIf you are an '''Algerian citizen''' – being a dual citizen of Algeria or having an Algerian father – possessing another passport will not exempt you from mandatory military service (applicable to men only) or grant you consular access and protection in the event you get detained or arrested.\n\n=== Women travellers ===\nIf you are married to an Algerian, you do not require permission from your husband to depart the country.\n\nForeign women often attract the attention of Algerian men. Being overly friendly to or making direct eye contact with an Algerian man may cause him to think that you're \"into\" him.\n\nBe warned that some men may sexually harass you. If this ever happens, don't be afraid to create a scene and don't feel the need to be polite; no woman should put up with rotten behaviour like that.\n\n==Stay healthy==\nAlthough Algeria has a universal healthcare system that covers all citizens and provides free medical care at public facilities, the public healthcare system is notorious for being poorly maintained; the system has been beset by underfunding, understaffing, overcrowding, corruption, and mismanagement. In addition, expect little to no help if you're not proficient in Arabic, French, or both. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated many of the problems facing Algeria's already troubled healthcare system. Private medical facilities are generally much better equipped than public medical facilities. \n\nMedical care in Southern Algeria, particularly in the Saharan Algeria|Sahara, is virtually non-existent, even for non-citizens. If you’re planning a trip to the area, it’s advisable to bring your own medical supplies.\n\nAlgeria is sometimes struck by localized power cuts during '''summer''' in the south, which means that refrigerated foods may go bad. Therefore, you should keep that in mind when eating in restaurants, as the likelihood of getting food poisoning is always there.\n\nMosquitoes are also a problem in Algeria, but they are just a nuisance, as malaria is not common. In urban areas, there is periodic city-wide spraying against mosquitoes.\n\nDo not expect very good '''water''' quality in southern Algeria, for drinking you can buy bottles of water instead of drinking tap water, they are cheap at  DA40 for 1,5L, so 5L of good water costs less than US$1.\n\n==Respect==\n\nAlgerians, North Africa|North Africans, and Middle East|Arabs in the Gulf share a common culture; therefore, much of what is considered good manners in the Arab world applies to Algeria. \n\nHonour is an important cornerstone of Algerian culture and forms the basis of all relationships in the country. Algerians believe that turning down someone's request causes them to lose honour. Be smart about what you say openly — criticising someone in public or making someone look bad in front of others can cause an Algerian to lose their honour, i.e., lose face. While it's not a crime to publicly shame someone in Algeria, Algerians are generally remarkably sensitive to strongly worded comments and won't hesitate to react with anger if you do anything that makes them feel unvalued and disrespected. \n\nAsk questions about or show some interest in Algerian history, geography, tourist attractions, and culture; this will get Algerians to like and respect you. As is the case anywhere, Algerians appreciate good comments about their country, customs, and culture. \n\nShow respect to elders. Act politely around someone older than you or in a position of authority, and do not say or do anything that would make them feel challenged.  \n\nThe terms \"brother\" and \"sister\" are often used to address people. They ''are not'' considered offensive. \n\nAlgerians generally value their privacy. That being said, it's not rude to ask if someone's married or if they have children.\n\n===Sensitive issues ===\n\n====Politics====\nDomestic politics are both highly sensitive and polarised. Algerians, in general, have a strained relationship with their government and it is common for them to express feelings of frustration, annoyance, and anger towards their government and politicians. While it's not a social faux pas to discuss politics, try to avoid stating your opinion on local politics; Algerians may not appreciate what you have to say. \n\nAvoid talking about Morocco. Although there are strong cultural, religious, and historical ties between the two nations, Algerian-Moroccan relations have been strained by several social and political issues. \n\nAvoid being overly enthusiastic about France. The French occupation of Algeria was a period of great suffering for many Algerians. Thousands of Algerians were arrested, imprisoned, tortured, exiled, and mistreated by the French, and Algerians feel that France hasn't done enough to acknowledge the harm it has caused to Algeria. In France, Algerians are sometimes discriminated against and treated with a degree of contempt. If you are of French-Algerian heritage, you should be extra careful; demonstrations of enthusiasm for France might get you labelled as a \"harki\" (a historically contested term with negative connotations) or a \"traitor\".\n\n'''Ethnicity''' is a ''very sensitive subject'' in Algeria. The Berbers, who make up 15-20% of the population, have a long history of being mistreated by the Arab-dominated Algerian government and have long struggled for autonomy and cultural rights. It would be considered awkward to ask an Algerian about what their ethnicity is; it could cause them to believe that you are questioning their loyalty to Algeria. Keep in mind that some Algerians believe that Algeria is not an Arab country. \n\nTry to not discuss the '''Algerian Civil War'''. Tens of thousands of Algerians perished during the war and it is still a wound in the national consciousness.\n\n==== Religion ====\n'''Islam''' is the state religion of Algeria, and is, at least on paper, practiced by 99% of the population. That being said, there's no special dress code in effect and Algerians are generally not as religious as their Arab counterparts. Algerian dress styles are generally similar to European dress styles. It's advisable to dress conservatively so that you don't stand out like a sore thumb. \n* When visiting sites of religious importance, behave and dress well. Some mosques may be off limits to non-Muslims. If in doubt, ask.\n* During Ramadan, you should refrain from eating, drinking, smoking, and chewing in public. Not doing so would be seen as insensitive and disrespectful.\n* Anything hinting at proselytism will neither be appreciated nor welcomed.\n\n===Smoking===\nAll cigarettes are sold freely.\n\nSmoking in the presence of someone who is not a smoker in a public place requires his permission. If someone does not like the smoke, coughs, or asks you not to smoke, just stop and say sorry. This is what the locals do.  If you are invited to someone's house, do not smoke unless the host does and after he does, you can ask for permission to smoke.\n\nIf you are in a restaurant or coffee terrace where people smoke, you can smoke, but if you are with locals who are not smokers, ask them first if it is okay.  Fewer and fewer people smoke, because of a global health awareness campaign. \n\nIf you are a non-smoker, you will still find it unpleasant in many public places because of smoking.\n\n==Connect==\n=== Mobile phone connections ===\nThere are 3 main mobile services in Algeria - Mobilis, Djezzy and Ooredoo (previously Nedima). It is easy to procure a pre-paid sim card for one of these operators at any airport. In February 2022, a SIM card with 60 GB of data was sold by Ooredoo for DA2500. There are several general stores all over the country which will sell you refill cards for these carriers. 3G services were launched on 1 December 2013, and 4G is available in a selection of major cities by all carriers.\n\n===Internet connection===\n\nThe only internet provider is the government owned Algerie Telecom which offers ADSL internet with speeds that vary from 1 Mbps to 20 Mbps and prices of DA1600 to DA7200 respectively. 4G LTE is also available, but speeds are very slow and service is not very good in rural areas.\n\n\n\n"

There are almost no traffic lights. Lights are replaced by policemen. There are police and military checkpoints almost in every municipality. Slowing down is highly recommended. Utilization of mobile phones when driving is strictly prohibited. Be sure to have your seat belts on.\n\n===By bus===\nLa Gare Routière, Algiers's central bus terminus, in the commune of Hussein Dey (7-10 min drive from downtown), offers a plethora of bus services to most major Algerian cities and towns cheaply and efficiently.

You should also consider the time of day – many shops close after dark and street lighting is often poor, so there will be a lot less people outside.\n\n=== By bike ===\nCycling is rather rare as many parts of Algiers are built on hills, and traffic can be dangerous. It can however be an option to explore the downtown, coastal or other areas. Bike rental is not so easy to find, but there are some bike shops that are willing to rent too.\n\nAt the Sablette beach promenade (see Do), bike rental is also available to cycle the few kilometres of track next to the sea.\n\n\n\n==See==\n\n* \n*\n* \n* \n*\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n===Casbah===\n\nThe '''Casbah''' is the ancient city, dating to the 17th century.
