Staff were friendly and helpful, sights were great and loved the extra stop by the Eiffel Tower.  There was a five course meal served with wine which included tuna, fish, beef, cheese and desert.  Tips: book in advance especially in busy times, you might need to request a non alcoholic or soft drink (outside of water) as these are not always served as standard, if you run out of wine we were able to request more, staying on after the small break stop is a must because this is when you will get the Eiffel Tower experience."

The poached egg starter and strawberry dessert were good but everything in between was not that great, especially the fish and duck. The duck was overcooked and the fish wasn’t seasoned well. I had just left the Loire Valley and ate at some amazing restaurants and this just didn’t even compare. The wine was also poor. There was a couple seated behind us and I heard the gentleman telling the wait staff that the only good thing was the bread and he told them he didn’t even want the duck brought to the table because the food had been so poor. It is a very jerky experience and I gave up trying to figure out what I was looking at, as my information wasn’t loading. This was a very overpriced, underwhelming experience and I wouldn’t repeat it. It was extremely disappointing to stop at Invalides for pictures, instead of outside the Eiffel Tower."

Pork chop arrived seared and raw when it was ordered well done.\nThe music was completely inappropriate for this kind of venue. It was more like a lobby of a cheap hotel.A last  comment… not the fault of the restaurant, but most of the clientele at lunch today were Chinese. They were very loud and rude, making TikTok videos and face timing with loud volume, and encroaching on our personal dining space.\nAn obviously French couple came in for lunch, sat down, and immediately left because of all of the above.\n\nThis could be an awesome venue, but sadly it was a bad experience.\nI wish we had bought sandwiches from a deli."

I really would not waste your money there.\n\nWe were initially left standing at the entrance as our table wasn't ready.\nEventually (after about 10 minutes) we were led to an awful table next to the waiters 'slops' station (where all the dirty plates and left over food are stacked). It was honestly the worst table in the restaurant.\nAs there were a number of other tables free, after a few minutes we stood up and asked to be moved. The waiter was incredibly rude to us as we swapped tables.\nHaving ordered an expensive bottle of Champagne it was frustrating that it was not bought to the table for a long time - in fact the starters were served before any drinks had arrived.\nThe main course was served cold. When I called the waiter over to say that the food was cold, I was told that 'that was the custom'. It obviously wasn't, and I left the meal. Nobody questioned why the food was left and the full meal was charged.\n\nParis has far too many fabulous restaurants to waste your time and money here. It really was awful."

The ambiance outside is definitely one of the highlights. However, the indoor dining area is quite underwhelming and lacks the charm you’d expect from a place like this.\nUnfortunately, the food was very disappointing. The pasta was nearly inedible — overcooked and chewy, like chewing gum. When we requested to switch to spaghetti, we were told no. My daughter also struggled with her meal, and her second dish was ruined by an overwhelming amount of garlic. Most of our group couldn’t finish their meals due to poor quality. The house rosé and white wine were equally subpar, leaving us all unimpressed.\nService was another low point. The restaurant was extremely busy, and it felt like the goal was to rush people in and out. We had to queue both to enter and leave via a tiny, 4-person lift, which was frustrating and unacceptable for a restaurant of this caliber. Our waiter was somewhat surly and not accommodating, particularly when we expressed dissatisfaction with the wine.\nWhile the outdoor area with its view of the Eiffel Tower is truly beautiful, the rest of the experience left a lot to be desired. Inside, the ambiance is nothing special, and overall, the restaurant doesn’t have a welcoming or “can-do” attitude.\nThe view is spectacular, but the rest of the experience at Gigi falls flat. Poor food quality, lackluster service, and an overall rushed feeling make it a place I wouldn’t return to. There are plenty of great dining options in Paris with a view of the Eiffel Tower, and sadly, this isn’t one of them.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’d like to adjust anything!"

The waiter said it was his fault and I should have asked but when i paid he also forced me to give a tip of either 10% or 20% there was no otheroption and quite frankly the waiter was making it embarrassing for us for asking about the wine cost. No where else in either Barcelona or Parisd did this occur and we ate at Michelin rated restaurants multiple times. Beware of the bait and swtich here but enjoy the ambiance.

We stopped to take photos of it's charming facade when a man offered to take some for us, with us in them. Turns out it was the owner, and he offered us a peek inside the very historic building. Wow what a gobsmacker!\nWe booked for dinner and were treated to sensational meals around oddly shaped tables (which is great) downstairs.  It is a 'choose your own' cellar, so my husband went and picked what he wanted.   It is a VERY old building so don't ex[pect large open spaces or modern decor.  It was wonky, charming, and decorated to the max in florid french style.  Gorgeous.   I absolutely loved it.  The food was great, but the atmosphere and the fun and rambunctious owner really made the atmosphere the stand out.   People talk together, over tables, sit at tables together, or separately, it's very 'as you see it'.   Prices are medium high, as you would expect.  it was our 30th Wedding anniversary, and we couldn't have picked better.\nTo top it off, a wonderful young man who was part of the Notre Dame choir, and in furlow until Notre Dame is open again, sang some beautiful french songs unaccompanied for the patrons at the restaurant.  Hauntingly beuatiful, it was just enchanting and his voice superb.  We will never forget the singer, and are really grateful he allowed us all to hear him sing, between his food courses!!\nWonderful.   REcommend.\nThankyou, Monsieur for your hospitality."

The owner is friendly and gently mocked my Englishness – A good start. There is no wine list – You go to the cellar and choose your own bottle – Starting from 25 Euros – Much cheaper that in the UK.\nThe owner told me what to have and it was the Best Beef Bourguignon I have experienced – And I make it myself! My companions had the pork medallions - pretty, moist and flavoursome and Confit du canard – falling off the bone and rich.\nWe started with snails – My only criticism was the snail wranglers were not quite fit for purpose so extracting our garlicy friends was a bit of a challenge.\nWe shared deserts – The chocolate bombe – spot on, and their version of Tart Tartine – more like a slice of apple pizza with flaky pastry – Light, crisp and subtly wonderful.\nThis is not a tourist restaurant.\nAnd later – SINGING by the piano as the diners gathered around and joined in. So special.\nRecommended for real and romantic people. Don’t go if you are a perfectionist or a cynic."

My friend had the bolognese which was just standard bolognese. \n\nIf you’re British, I’ve genuinely had better food at a hungry horse. Honestly, save your money and go to McDonald’s because it’s a lot better. \n\nThis would be fine, if the bill didn’t come to €103 for two pasta dishes and two drinks 😟\n\nThe customer service wasn’t anything out of the ordinary, wasn’t good, wasn’t bad either. \n\nAlso, I suppose it doesn’t have anything to do with the restaurant itself, but a man attempted to mug me right outside of the restaurant and then walked into the restaurant to be served."

I never go anywhere without first consulting my BFF Tripadvisor.... the review said the check in and out was long and hard.. I downloaded the Caesars app( Paris is owned by) that did not help - when I arrived at 8pm on a Tuesday night.. there was a amazingly long line for that time of night.. however I left my man in line while I went to the self check in Kiosks.. I had heard mixed review about this too... In literally minutes I was all checked in and had 2 room keys in my hand and was on my way to my room while is calmly and happily walked by the still very long line!! it was easy and fast... We had reservations at the Eiffel tower restaurant that we would have missed if we wainted. We also had access to a texting concierge which I had never used before.. OMG LOVE IT whomever got this idea I love you... any question about reservations, room service, check in I just texted and got an immediate answer... when we checked in there was not pen or paper in our room- I texted the conceirge and it was delivered within 5 minutes.. ordered room service this way and arranged to get bags bell checked this way. check out this way too... super easy!!\n\nWIFI said only 2 devices so we could only do our 2 phones... when I tried to watch tv later it would not connect to the internet for regular hotel tv( which was internet) so I am not sure if this was because our 2 devices were used up with our phones... I ended up going to sleep instead but this is something if I was there longer I would have wanted fixed\n\n3288P Bourdeux tower -was our room - it was the absolute best view of the Eiffel Tower and the Bellagio fountain below.. such a gorgerous room - large bathroom with bidet. extra little make up table with magnifing lamp plenty of closet storage a beautiful living room with full 6 person dinner table.. nice quiet floor - none of the rooms are too fair from the elelvator as they feed inward. \n\nroom service breakfast was tres expensive but expected and yummy. \nthe hotel as everything you need cute things to buy in the gift shop- easy valet parking and easy bell check for luggage if you have a little time to spend after checking out. We took the very easy walk right across the street to the Bellagio to see the huge Christmas display!!! \nHighly recommend this room and hotel. I was nervous about check in after reading review but I experienced none of these problems. We made Eiffel tower restaurant reservations ahead of time... I highly recommend doing this as all the dining looked like it had lines and only had seating for reservations!! \n\nBOOK it and enjoy France without the extra trip to Europe.. I thought it was clean, friendly and wonderfully romantic."

We had been out walking all day and weren’t wearing head to toe fur coats or carrying Louis Vuitton bags, so he clearly knew we weren’t good enough to be in the building and wanted to make sure to keep out the riffraff.\n\nPlenty of other people walked by without his comment, their noses in the air, and that of course was no problem to the doorman because those people clearly belonged. It’s ironic that a space that ought to exist to make people feel welcome instead does the opposite. Stuffy, “exclusive” Parisian hotel culture at its worst."

You need to bring your friends with you.\n\nI moved to the Vendome bar with lovely piano tunes and had a lively conversation with an attorney from Finland and later, a couple from Australia.

Many flights from the US arrive quite early in the morning, so this was a huge plus for me. It is also possible to delay check out until 3 pm on your day of departure. \n\nI have already booked a second stay for January 2025"

The room was beautiful, the shower/water-pressure was amazing, huge fluffy white towels, comfortable bed. I wish we had time to experience the pool and spa."

The staff were incredibly attentive to us, from the moment we arrived with the help of the bellboy to the young woman at reception (Helena, I believe) who checked us in. Everything was perfect. The highlight was the concierge, Fabrice, who assisted us when we had an issue with our flight tickets. He took a lot of time to help us, and it truly saved the rest of our trip – thank you! The hotel is undergoing some construction on the ground floor, but it didn't affect our stay as we weren’t disturbed in our room, and the staff were so kind that we didn’t mind at all. The location is very central, allowing us to get everywhere quickly. It was a fantastic experience, and we will definitely return here every time we visit Paris!"

We went for our anniversary and boy did they treat us great... roses, candles, and chocolates it couldn't have been nicer .

The Peninsula is well stated elegance and cool and calm and serene with just enough edge of excitement.  The rooms are very nice and well supported by the technology that is part of their now standard array (we were at the new Peninsula in Istanbul in August and will provide a separate review). We were met at the door by Rana Martin form guest services and escorted to our room. The suite was nice and well appointed and very comfortable. A lovely selection of fruit and macrons awaited us and the flowers and appointments in the room were lovely and very proper and home. Rana is a gem in all respects.\n\nThe hallmark of The Peninsula has become its persons. Everyone greets you with a welcoming smile and treats you as an honored guest. The entire Concierge staff assisted with our flowers for our room and our challenging requests for restaurant reservations. This was handled by the entire team including Jeremie and Célia and Clotilde and Christophe (the entire very large and capable team is always happy and eager to be of assistance!). Pro traveler tip: get the WhatsApp contact to the Concierge Team and make your asks in real time and enjoy immediate and professional support before and during your stay. The service levels they provide are exactly why one stays at The Peninsula as they do everything with a smile and sense of pride that enhances the experience.\n\nWe caught up on much needed sleep at the hotel during our stay. It has been a long time since we traveled without our wonderful kids and the peace and quiet were spectacular. We enjoyed excellent room service breakfast daily and appreciated the highest quality linens and bedding and bath products. \n\nThank you to the entire staff from front of house to housekeeping for a wonderful stay."

I had chosen to go to the lobby while waiting for a friend, with the intention of having a drink right after. To my great surprise, I was simply “kicked out” of the lobby under the pretext that I was not drinking immediately and that I was not expecting anyone residing at the hotel.\nPeople ask me who exactly I'm waiting for, what an indiscretion!\nI have never been treated in such a humiliating manner in an establishment of this magnitude. I have gone very often to have breakfasts and even lunches in this establishment where I will never return, I will obviously tell my experience to other people around me\nA man named SAÏD (I wonder how he was able to obtain such a position in charge of security) was arrogant, indelicate and disrespectful. I was made to feel like an unwanted intruder, even though I was planning to spend money at the hotel.\nThis behavior is unbecoming of a hotel of this reputation, and I strongly advise anyone not to go there if you expect a minimum of courtesy and professionalism. There are many other establishments in Paris that know how to treat their customers with respect and consideration, which is clearly not the case here.\nAbsolutely not worthy of a palace!"

The last version  was  that Euro 250, is not enough to cover the purchase of a couple of croissant. It only covers the cleaning fee, should you decide to smoke in a non smoking room. \nNeedless to say that had they asked for more deposit, I would have happily obliged.\nUpon entering the room, we noticed the safe was locked since previous guest, so we had to call security.\nWe woke up in the middle of the night, suffering from jet lag and decided to make a cup of tea. Unfortunately, tea bags had not been replenished since previous guest.\nI decided instead to read in bed, this is when I noticed the bed lamp, above bedside, heavily covered in dust.\nSpoke to a manager upon check out, but still feel very disappointed.\nThis is our 6th stay at the hotel, the last one being last July. We still love the hotel, the location and the brand. Not sure what happened since our last stay, but the service has dropped to what is now an unacceptably low level.

The metro (Porte Maillot)  is a block away from that Hyatt.   We did metro most of the time and a few times an Uber (never a taxi) when I was just too tired or for timing.  On our first day we had an “over view of Paris tour”. It included how to use the metro, buy tickets,  read that “spaghetti map” a walk around Notre Dame area and lots of helpful tips on having a great experience while touring Paris! It included  city etiquette-like how to read a restaurant, do I just sit down or ask for a table, tipping etc!  It was so helpful. This hotel is connect s to a true shopping mall (came in handy when we needed cold meds) and a convention center.  The new rail car system stop is a half block away, and  was being tested pre Olympics when we were there in March.  The hotel has bamboo keys and smart elevators. We did have a view of the tower from our room!  We did not select this hotel, it was part of a Paris to Normandy Viking cruise, and we were very happy there!"

The was a Sunday Morning Market under the train railway. We were so excited as that was the best way to see the local life and experience the local delicacy. \n\nMy room was upgraded and was located at the corner, can enjoy the Eiffel Tower view at the living room. The living room is spacious. We also have a mini kitchenette too. So convenient to cook/reheat the food as there are stoves and microwave oven.\n\nI love the water and coffee/tea dispenser machines at the lobby. Unlimited coffee/tea, hot chocolate, still & sparkling water are available 24hours. \n\nThe lobby is not very big but it is cozy & modern + clean. You need to have keycard to access to the entrance from outside. Same goes to the guest floors access with keycard only for safety control.\n\nWhen the train passing by, the vibration will notify you for every trip as the train railway just next to the hotel.\n\nThe whole staying experience can be enhanced further if we could feel the warm service + more cheerful smile to make us at ease, especially when we are travelling to a foreign country that we are not familiar with the local language, culture and environment. \n\nWarm service + friendly smile can earn another 2 stars to perfection for this stay!"

The complimentary coffee downstairs didn’t have sugar almost all the time. The TV doesn’t have the option to mirror my cell screen, it is an important feature nowadays."

The front desk attendants were always courteous, patient and helpful (yes, they all spoke English). Our room was clean and comfortable. Very spacious. We didn't chose a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower, which turned out to be a good choice for us  because once you leave the hotel, the Tower is in view from practically everywhere. A few quirks to be aware of; the key card needs to stay inserted in the room for the lights to work, and you must tap the key card to the motion sensor in the elevator or it won't go anywhere. Hopefully this tip will help others avoid our fate, which was to look like complete American idiots, pushing the button repeatedly to no avail until someone from the desk came to rescue us.  Our room was very quiet. There is an overhead train directly across the street. We could barely hear it, but we were on the other side of the building. I don't know if it is loud from the Eiffel-facing rooms. Of course, this was wonderful for getting around, as the Metro station is right across the street. There are a host of restaurants and shops in the neighborhood and the Eiffel Tower is within easy walking distance. Our only substantive criticism is that the air conditioning didn't keep the room very cool. It was in the 80's and humid during our stay, and the room was quite warm even with the air turned to the coldest setting. I imagine we'll have to get used to other countries being more energy conscious than the U.S. Overall, I would highly recommend Citadines Tour Eiffel!"

My husband fell really sick on the 3rd night of the stay, and the front desk staff really tried their best to contact a local doctor to come over to the hotel (though unsuccessful), but they were prepared to send my husband to the nearest hospital if he needed. Applaud for the professionalism and the readiness to such medical emergencies. \n\nThe hotel was also really sweet to give us a bottle of champagne, Cake & a sweet card to celebrate our anniversary! \n\nHowever, 1 thing to note was the poor room service. We had to ask for refill of amenities daily, which took really long each time to reach the room. and it got pretty frustrating, especially on nights when we were back from a long day. This was the main factor that contributed to what I felt was a average stay. To be also fair to the team, other than the amenities portion, the room is kept clean. \n\nOther than that, the hotel location is awesome. Right beside a couple of yummy cafes, Metro, and really close to the Eiffel Tower! There's also a little convenience store just right around the corner which we could also conveniently get ourselves little snacks. "

Its a bit away (30min walk) from Elysees but the walking way is along Seine is very nice/quite and plenty of things to discover about Paris. With taxi max 10min driving. But if you are fan of Eiffel - its the best location. From hotel to trocadero 10min nice walking way with perfect view.\nStaff - Very helpfull. Especially Sarah GR manager and Stolic Tea who helped a lot. \nRoom Size - I had deluxe room with balcony. Amazing room with Eiffel view and Size is perfect. You can relax there. \nEntertainment - No need to go outside for nice PAris evening - at least 2 nights. 1 nigt you can spend at top roof restaurant and enjoy Eiffel nioght view. and 2nd night in lobby restaurant where superb DJ is playing with cozy atmoshphere. Other nights you can go out ))\nThe only improvement area - in Deluxe room its not good to have  2 twin beds combined as King Bed)). Despite it did not affect lot, King bed itself makes big difference compare dto 2 twin beds combined as KING :)\nThanks Hotel team for their help in making my 5day trip to Paris relaxing and enjoyiable.

Visited on a hot summer day in July. As we rented a house in Esbly we were only 8 minutes away. We arrived before 10.00 and passing security and the entrance went smoothly. Then the wait started. You can see in the app and per attraction what the waiting time is. 1 - 2 hours of waiting is no exception. The park is nice and the attractions are great but waiting 2 hours for a 2 minute ride is not funny. We were with teenagers and focused on the rollercoasters but also did 'it's a small world', Alice's Curious Labyrinth, Autopia and the railroad. It was nice to sit for a while in a cool place during Mickey’s PhilharMagic. We have seen and experienced it and we don't think about it to come back. The hot temperature and long waiting lines aren't worth it. The price (we paid almost USD 80 per person with a Family and Friends ticket) is also not attractive to try it another time. Restaurants, food stands, and souvenir shops are also extremely expensive, but they think they can justify it because it's Disney. The crew we interacted with is also not friendly and looks stressed but what you imagine with these big crowds? When we wanted to fill our water bottles (they have some water fountains) a lady started shouting to us because it was the area for the disabled people to watch the parade. Way too much stress. We have seen it, it was a nice experience, but the long lines, high price and stressed crew doesn't attract us to come back."

Maybe princesses (especially since for Princess Pavilion you have to wait so long in line and then meet whatever comes your way), fairies, no Frozen characters or shows available\n- some sort of virtual queues would be nice"

The history of the Catacombs dates back to the late 18th century when the city's cemeteries were closed due to health reasons and its contents were moved to an underground site. Today, you can walk down the spiral staircase and take a guided tour of the network of tunnels or explore it at your own pace. It's recommended to buy skip-the-line tickets online to avoid snaking lines. You can easily reach the Catacombs by hopping on the Paris Metro. – Tripadvisor",

                        "review_text": "Rode the Paris Metro when I visited Paris in September 2024. And it was very convenient for me to travel from the hotel in the outskirts of the city (Gallieni) to different parts of Central Paris (including the Eiffel Tower, Trocadéro Square & Louvre Museum. The services were relatively frequent (at least every 4-5 minutes at peak times), it covers most areas of the cities with a dense coverage in Central Paris, the trains were relatively quick - even with older trains being used in Line 3, some of the modern lines are automated with cab/front views and have platform edge/screen doors, station spacing was relatively close without long distances (compared to parts of the London Underground), and they are also integrated with the RER Trains, buses and even trams (although I didn't ride the trams) - to which I can say Paris has an amazing public transport network on the whole (possibly one of the best in the world with its different modes).\n\nHowever, my only issues with the Paris Metro was that accessibility in the older lines wasn't great as most of the old Metro stations didn't have lifts, escalators or level boarding with the trains (wasn't a major issue for me, but would be trouble for disabled and older people alongside people with heavy luggage/loads), the train reliability for Line 3 was variable (most of the time it was fine, but on the last day, there was a signal failure which really slowed down train speed & operations) and a few older stations looked a bit worn out & in need of better maintenance. I also thought it was a little bit weird that a few lines had rubber-tyred tracks although those lines were thankfully quite quick & reliable. But apart from those, the Paris Metro on the whole was very convenient for me."

As tourists with two minors, we were abruptly and disproportionately approached by four \"metro agents\". They demanded our tickets and, upon not finding one (which had been lost during the trip), accused us of fraud. Despite showing the purchase receipt and explaining that we had just arrived that morning, they ignored us and fined us (50 euros). This experience was very traumatic and left a bitter taste in our mouths, ruining what was supposed to be a short two-day trip. We felt a great sense of injustice. How many other people have gone through something similar? Paris is an empty shell without tourism and this is yet another demonstration of how badly the city treats those who keep it alive. -- Le mois dernier, notre famille a vécu une expérience terrible dans le métro parisien. En tant que touristes avec deux mineurs, nous avons été abordés de manière brutale et disproportionnée par quatre \"agents de métro\". Ils ont exigé nos billets et, n'en trouvant pas un (qui avait été perdu pendant le voyage), nous ont accusés de fraude. Malgré la présentation du reçu d'achat et l'explication que nous venions d'arriver ce matin-là, ils nous ont ignorés et nous ont infligé une amende de 50 euros. Cette expérience a été très traumatisante et nous a laissé un goût amer, gâchant ce qui devait être un court séjour de deux jours. Nous avons ressenti un profond sentiment d'injustice. Combien d'autres personnes ont vécu une expérience similaire ? Paris est une coquille vide sans le tourisme et c'est une nouvelle démonstration de la façon dont la ville traite mal ceux qui la font vivre."

However, the ticket they gave us wouldn’t validate. When I went back to the staff for help, they told me to join the line again, even though it was super long and we were running late.\n\nI politely asked for assistance again, but instead of helping, the staff started using foul language. I was with my sister, and we didn’t have time to argue, so I just let it go. In the end, they opened the gate for us, but it was a terrible experience.\n\nI wouldn’t recommend using the metro if you’re short on time. The staff was rude and unhelpful, and honestly, it didn’t feel safe. It’s disappointing that behavior like this goes unchecked."

Just after going through we were surrounded by 3 guards aggressively wanting to check tickets. When my partners was said to be 'invalid' as if it had not gone through the barrier they demanded a €60 fine - no discussion. We explained we had just bought it with help from a staff member for the final journey we needed to make back to the Eurostar and asked if we could point her out. She stormed off and refused to let us point her out. When she returned she said the ticket office staff said no one helped!! They said they would call police which would raise the fine to €200. They were bullying and aggressive and it was very clear there was a genuine mistake as they had watched us the whole time buying the ticket and go through. \nWe will never visit Paris again and if you are going avoid the Metro - there is definately scamming there with tourists from the very people who should be looking out for you. What an awful way to treat tourists. Made me appreciate the UK and Londons underground staff. We were glad to be home and will not visit France again ever."

                        "review_text": "Just back from a 3 night stay in Paris with 2 children aged 14 and 12. I had lived in Paris 30 years ago, but my wife and kids were new to the city.\n\nThe Paris Metro system is fantastic. If you are staying in the city you are probably less than 250m from an entrance into the Metro and your destination is equally close to a stop. If your destination is on the same line as your start location just follow the signs for that line - there will be 2 options, one for each direction, and the direction is indicated by the name of the last station in that direction. Sometimes they will also list out the stops in each direction, but not always. If its on a different line you will need to change - this involves getting off at a stop and following signs for the next line/direction you need to take. You won't have to leave the Metro system, so you don't need a second ticket. \nWe used the phone app Bonjour RATP to see the best route (including transfers). I would suggest practice using this app before you go if you are new to subway systems.\n\nWe used paper tickets as we didn't know how much we'd use the Metro, but a Navigo Easy card each preloaded with tickets would have been cheaper and simpler. There are other options such as day passes etc. The paper tickets we bought were called t+ tickets and they cover any journeys within the metro system except to Orly Airport.\n\nHang on to your ticket until you leave the Metro system! Twice we had to use the same ticket twice as there was a second set of turnstiles for some reason. Also, while we didn't see any ticket inspectors, they do check tickets and you'll be fined if you have thrown your ticket away.\n\nA few words of warning:\n\nTake precautions against pick pockets - they will target tourists and its hard to look like a local! Carriages can be crowded so valuables need to be well secured. We didn't see any pickpockets, but there were warnings everywhere. I also bought any tickets in Republique rather than the more touristy stations.\n\nWe took the Metro from Universite Saint Denis to Republic and back as we arrived on the bus from Beauvais airport. I felt it was quite challenging travelling as a family with suitcases in rush hour. We had to manoeuvre to make sure we were near the carriage doors so we could get out in time (Parisiens are impressively polite though!) If the kids were younger I would have looked into another form of transportation for this journey.\n\nThe system is old, and unlike more modern systems it doesn't seem very accessible. If you are unable to use stairs then do your research before travelling - while some stations have lifts I didn't see many.\n\nSome Metro journeys involve quite a bit of walking within the system (to/from platforms, between lines etc)\n\nSome trains are very busy - so you'll find yourself quite squashed in. The longest wait time we saw was 4 minutes though, so if you are concerned about a train being excessively full, then wait for the next one.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall we took 12 journeys on the Metro in 3.5 days, most journeys took less than 20 minutes. We stayed in Republique, which has a number of lines, so most journeys didn't need a transfer. We packed loads into our trip to Paris and there is no way we could have seen and done as much without such an efficient form of transportation, and the kids really enjoyed the novelty of it."

Our tours are in English and last for around 3 hours. They include some walking and standing, but also feature a seated tasting with wine pairings. Our tours are designed for adults. We’re unable to host children under ten years of age. Our price of 125€ per person is a little higher than the competition because we spend more than anyone else on premium tastings and to pay the most experienced and knowledgable guides in Paris.

Luckily the ladies in charge helped us to make the reservation on the spot and we could go without too much of waiting. It is very nice to walk on the glass floor and have a view from there. After that we went to the rooftop for an even better view of Paris. We wanted to visit the restaurant but with that one we had less luck as  it was full.

Outside the cathedral, you can admire its grand exterior which is framed by an elegant pair of bell towers, stained glass windows and an ornately decorated facade with grand statues. You can also enter the cathedral for a small entrance fee to view Nio-Gothic artwork and furniture as well as join their weekly sessions. – Tripadvisor",

The publication of Victor Hugo’s novel “The Hunchback of Notre-Dame” in 1831 renewed interest in preserving what by then had become little more than a rundown landmark. Even the iconic wooden spire was a later addition, having been added in 1859. At the time of the fire, a five-year goal was set for the restoration of the cathredral. Given that it took almost 200 years to build, some thought that two or three times that number might be needed. But now, an opening date of December 7 has been officially announced, just a month away—although further work will continue for another year or two. These pictures, which were taken on a misty Sunday in October, show how much has been done—and still to be completed."

This district is still home to many kosher restaurants.\nAnother iconic site is the Place des Vosges, verdant, which houses elegant arcades and the Victor Hugo museum, where the writer lived. \nThe streets around the Saint-Paul metro station lead to the Maison Européenne de la Photographie but you have not less intersting museums such as Les Archives Nationales and Le Musee Carnavalet, ideal for rainy days.\n\nBut actually if we forget the trendy aspect of the Marais, I love it for its narrow streets and its Louis XIII architecture which takes me back to the history of Paris."

Staff in the reception area were helpful and still gave check in advice with the added perk of no line. Our room was very clean and seemed fairly recently updated. Formula 1 setup slightly blocked our view, but we could still watch the Bellagio fountains from our room. The rest of the property is just as beautiful as the room with gorgeous restaurants - try Alexxas for brunch and snag the Cinnaroll Waffle. We even were offered an impromptu tour of the Eiffel Tower restaurant on our last day. Mobile checkout was even easier than checkin. I’ll definitely be staying here on our next trip to Las Vegas."

The queue for check in was over an hour - we were slightly early and were told to either pay $50 for early check in or join the queue again. There was an automatic check in machine but it wasn't working. There was only 3 clerks on, and the queue was out of the reception and into the casino.We were celebrating our 41st wedding anniversary and asked if an upgrade was possible and the clerk literally snorted and laughed at us.  I said that I didn't expect that response, she told us that the staff were not allowed to arrange upgrades, and she was fed up of people asking, and she was thinking of just walking out, and how stressed and understaffed they were, and her manager didn't care. We paid for the early check in, just so we didn't have to queue again. It certainly put a dampener on our visit.The room was dated but OK, but no tea or coffee making facilities. We asked if we could get a kettle and were told that no rooms have that facility any more. $8 for a cup of very weak tea was a bit excessive, I thought, and when I asked for another tea bag as it was so weak, was asked for another $8! Lots of very drunk and noisy people coming back to their rooms during the night and shouting and slamming doors. There was a lot of mess in the corridors- dropped popcorn etc, and this was not cleared up. We visited lots of the other hotels, and none of them had such problems with checking in queues. We found the reception staff off hand and unfriendly, and the bar staff weren't much better. We ordered a coctkail for me and my husband asked for a whiskey. The barman asked which one, and my husband ordered one. \"That's a Scotch, not a whiskey says the barman\" - we giggled and said - oh that's what you call it over here- he very rudely replied that it was called Scotch everywhere, and you should know what you want to order and avoid me wasting my time having to explain things to you. This trip to Las Vegas was part of a special holiday and the visit to Paris Hotel was the lowest point in our trip. The customer care was much better in other hotels - we used the bars there. Go some where else"

For something Iike this I would have expected at least a phonecall but no!!!   Please, please make sure if you book in advance that you check your credit card details.  I was so upset to lose my booking of 10 months and phoned the hotel but there was no apology I was told to go online and book another room.  We managed to do this but with no view of the Eiffel Tower as was originally booked.   Still no apology (even when I arrived at the hotel in person) a very very sad and disappointed customer 😥"

Visited on a hot summer day in July. As we rented a house in Esbly we were only 8 minutes away. We arrived before 10.00 and passing security and the entrance went smoothly. Then the wait started. You can see in the app and per attraction what the waiting time is. 1 - 2 hours of waiting is no exception. The park is nice and the attractions are great but waiting 2 hours for a 2 minute ride is not funny. We were with teenagers and focused on the rollercoasters but also did 'it's a small world', Alice's Curious Labyrinth, Autopia and the railroad. It was nice to sit for a while in a cool place during Mickey’s PhilharMagic. We have seen and experienced it and we don't think about it to come back. The hot temperature and long waiting lines aren't worth it. The price (we paid almost USD 80 per person with a Family and Friends ticket) is also not attractive to try it another time. Restaurants, food stands, and souvenir shops are also extremely expensive, but they think they can justify it because it's Disney. The crew we interacted with is also not friendly and looks stressed but what you imagine with these big crowds? When we wanted to fill our water bottles (they have some water fountains) a lady started shouting to us because it was the area for the disabled people to watch the parade. Way too much stress. We have seen it, it was a nice experience, but the long lines, high price and stressed crew doesn't attract us to come back."

Maybe princesses (especially since for Princess Pavilion you have to wait so long in line and then meet whatever comes your way), fairies, no Frozen characters or shows available\n- some sort of virtual queues would be nice"

I never go anywhere without first consulting my BFF Tripadvisor.... the review said the check in and out was long and hard.. I downloaded the Caesars app( Paris is owned by) that did not help - when I arrived at 8pm on a Tuesday night.. there was a amazingly long line for that time of night.. however I left my man in line while I went to the self check in Kiosks.. I had heard mixed review about this too... In literally minutes I was all checked in and had 2 room keys in my hand and was on my way to my room while is calmly and happily walked by the still very long line!! it was easy and fast... We had reservations at the Eiffel tower restaurant that we would have missed if we wainted. We also had access to a texting concierge which I had never used before.. OMG LOVE IT whomever got this idea I love you... any question about reservations, room service, check in I just texted and got an immediate answer... when we checked in there was not pen or paper in our room- I texted the conceirge and it was delivered within 5 minutes.. ordered room service this way and arranged to get bags bell checked this way. check out this way too... super easy!!\n\nWIFI said only 2 devices so we could only do our 2 phones... when I tried to watch tv later it would not connect to the internet for regular hotel tv( which was internet) so I am not sure if this was because our 2 devices were used up with our phones... I ended up going to sleep instead but this is something if I was there longer I would have wanted fixed\n\n3288P Bourdeux tower -was our room - it was the absolute best view of the Eiffel Tower and the Bellagio fountain below.. such a gorgerous room - large bathroom with bidet. extra little make up table with magnifing lamp plenty of closet storage a beautiful living room with full 6 person dinner table.. nice quiet floor - none of the rooms are too fair from the elelvator as they feed inward. \n\nroom service breakfast was tres expensive but expected and yummy. \nthe hotel as everything you need cute things to buy in the gift shop- easy valet parking and easy bell check for luggage if you have a little time to spend after checking out. We took the very easy walk right across the street to the Bellagio to see the huge Christmas display!!! \nHighly recommend this room and hotel. I was nervous about check in after reading review but I experienced none of these problems. We made Eiffel tower restaurant reservations ahead of time... I highly recommend doing this as all the dining looked like it had lines and only had seating for reservations!! \n\nBOOK it and enjoy France without the extra trip to Europe.. I thought it was clean, friendly and wonderfully romantic."

The history of the Catacombs dates back to the late 18th century when the city's cemeteries were closed due to health reasons and its contents were moved to an underground site. Today, you can walk down the spiral staircase and take a guided tour of the network of tunnels or explore it at your own pace. It's recommended to buy skip-the-line tickets online to avoid snaking lines. You can easily reach the Catacombs by hopping on the Paris Metro. – Tripadvisor",

And it was very convenient for me to travel from the hotel in the outskirts of the city (Gallieni) to different parts of Central Paris (including the Eiffel Tower, Trocadéro Square & Louvre Museum. The services were relatively frequent (at least every 4-5 minutes at peak times), it covers most areas of the cities with a dense coverage in Central Paris, the trains were relatively quick - even with older trains being used in Line 3, some of the modern lines are automated with cab/front views and have platform edge/screen doors, station spacing was relatively close without long distances (compared to parts of the London Underground), and they are also integrated with the RER Trains, buses and even trams (although I didn't ride the trams) - to which I can say Paris has an amazing public transport network on the whole (possibly one of the best in the world with its different modes).\n\nHowever, my only issues with the Paris Metro was that accessibility in the older lines wasn't great as most of the old Metro stations didn't have lifts, escalators or level boarding with the trains (wasn't a major issue for me, but would be trouble for disabled and older people alongside people with heavy luggage/loads), the train reliability for Line 3 was variable (most of the time it was fine, but on the last day, there was a signal failure which really slowed down train speed & operations) and a few older stations looked a bit worn out & in need of better maintenance. I also thought it was a little bit weird that a few lines had rubber-tyred tracks although those lines were thankfully quite quick & reliable.

Despite showing the purchase receipt and explaining that we had just arrived that morning, they ignored us and fined us (50 euros).

She stormed off and refused to let us point her out. When she returned she said the ticket office staff said no one helped!! They said they would call police which would raise the fine to €200. They were bullying and aggressive and it was very clear there was a genuine mistake as they had watched us the whole time buying the ticket and go through. \nWe will never visit Paris again and if you are going avoid the Metro - there is definately scamming there with tourists from the very people who should be looking out for you.

I had lived in Paris 30 years ago, but my wife and kids were new to the city.\n\nThe Paris Metro system is fantastic. If you are staying in the city you are probably less than 250m from an entrance into the Metro and your destination is equally close to a stop. If your destination is on the same line as your start location just follow the signs for that line - there will be 2 options, one for each direction, and the direction is indicated by the name of the last station in that direction. Sometimes they will also list out the stops in each direction, but not always. If its on a different line you will need to change - this involves getting off at a stop and following signs for the next line/direction you need to take. You won't have to leave the Metro system, so you don't need a second ticket. \nWe used the phone app Bonjour RATP to see the best route (including transfers). I would suggest practice using this app before you go if you are new to subway systems.\n\nWe used paper tickets as we didn't know how much we'd use the Metro, but a Navigo Easy card each preloaded with tickets would have been cheaper and simpler. There are other options such as day passes etc. The paper tickets we bought were called t+ tickets and they cover any journeys within the metro system except to Orly Airport.\n\nHang on to your ticket until you leave the Metro system! Twice we had to use the same ticket twice as there was a second set of turnstiles for some reason. Also, while we didn't see any ticket inspectors, they do check tickets and you'll be fined if you have thrown your ticket away.\n\nA few words of warning:\n\nTake precautions against pick pockets - they will target tourists and its hard to look like a local! Carriages can be crowded so valuables need to be well secured. We didn't see any pickpockets, but there were warnings everywhere. I also bought any tickets in Republique rather than the more touristy stations.\n\nWe took the Metro from Universite Saint Denis to Republic and back as we arrived on the bus from Beauvais airport. I felt it was quite challenging travelling as a family with suitcases in rush hour. We had to manoeuvre to make sure we were near the carriage doors so we could get out in time (Parisiens are impressively polite though!) If the kids were younger I would have looked into another form of transportation for this journey.\n\nThe system is old, and unlike more modern systems it doesn't seem very accessible. If you are unable to use stairs then do your research before travelling - while some stations have lifts I didn't see many.\n\nSome Metro journeys involve quite a bit of walking within the system (to/from platforms, between lines etc)\n\nSome trains are very busy - so you'll find yourself quite squashed in. The longest wait time we saw was 4 minutes though, so if you are concerned about a train being excessively full, then wait for the next one.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall we took 12 journeys on the Metro in 3.5 days, most journeys took less than 20 minutes. We stayed in Republique, which has a number of lines, so most journeys didn't need a transfer. We packed loads into our trip to Paris and there is no way we could have seen and done as much without such an efficient form of transportation, and the kids really enjoyed the novelty of it."

The rooms are very nice and well supported by the technology that is part of their now standard array (we were at the new Peninsula in Istanbul in August and will provide a separate review). We were met at the door by Rana Martin form guest services and escorted to our room. The suite was nice and well appointed and very comfortable. A lovely selection of fruit and macrons awaited us and the flowers and appointments in the room were lovely and very proper and home. Rana is a gem in all respects.\n\nThe hallmark of The Peninsula has become its persons. Everyone greets you with a welcoming smile and treats you as an honored guest. The entire Concierge staff assisted with our flowers for our room and our challenging requests for restaurant reservations. This was handled by the entire team including Jeremie and Célia and Clotilde and Christophe (the entire very large and capable team is always happy and eager to be of assistance!). Pro traveler tip: get the WhatsApp contact to the Concierge Team and make your asks in real time and enjoy immediate and professional support before and during your stay. The service levels they provide are exactly why one stays at The Peninsula as they do everything with a smile and sense of pride that enhances the experience.\n\nWe caught up on much needed sleep at the hotel during our stay. It has been a long time since we traveled without our wonderful kids and the peace and quiet were spectacular. We enjoyed excellent room service breakfast daily and appreciated the highest quality linens and bedding and bath products. \n\nThank you to the entire staff from front of house to housekeeping for a wonderful stay."

The rooms have been incredibly soundproofed and designed with a comfortable elegance that is perfect for relaxing after a long day of perusing the streets. Additionally, the service is kind, helpful, and a delight. \n\nThe only dings (and they’re small ones), are the firmness of the mattress, the tiny size of the gym, and, the Cantonese restaurant whose food is TERRIBLE. Also, if this is your first trip to Paris, it’s not in the most central location but the metro is so easy to navigate it shouldn’t matter."

I had chosen to go to the lobby while waiting for a friend, with the intention of having a drink right after. To my great surprise, I was simply “kicked out” of the lobby under the pretext that I was not drinking immediately and that I was not expecting anyone residing at the hotel.\nPeople ask me who exactly I'm waiting for, what an indiscretion!\nI have never been treated in such a humiliating manner in an establishment of this magnitude. I have gone very often to have breakfasts and even lunches in this establishment where I will never return, I will obviously tell my experience to other people around me\nA man named SAÏD (I wonder how he was able to obtain such a position in charge of security) was arrogant, indelicate and disrespectful. I was made to feel like an unwanted intruder, even though I was planning to spend money at the hotel.\nThis behavior is unbecoming of a hotel of this reputation, and I strongly advise anyone not to go there if you expect a minimum of courtesy and professionalism. There are many other establishments in Paris that know how to treat their customers with respect and consideration, which is clearly not the case here.\nAbsolutely not worthy of a palace!"

Staff were friendly and helpful, sights were great and loved the extra stop by the Eiffel Tower.  There was a five course meal served with wine which included tuna, fish, beef, cheese and desert.  Tips: book in advance especially in busy times, you might need to request a non alcoholic or soft drink (outside of water) as these are not always served as standard, if you run out of wine we were able to request more, staying on after the small break stop is a must because this is when you will get the Eiffel Tower experience."

The poached egg starter and strawberry dessert were good but everything in between was not that great, especially the fish and duck. The duck was overcooked and the fish wasn’t seasoned well. I had just left the Loire Valley and ate at some amazing restaurants and this just didn’t even compare. The wine was also poor. There was a couple seated behind us and I heard the gentleman telling the wait staff that the only good thing was the bread and he told them he didn’t even want the duck brought to the table because the food had been so poor. It is a very jerky experience and I gave up trying to figure out what I was looking at, as my information wasn’t loading. This was a very overpriced, underwhelming experience and I wouldn’t repeat it. It was extremely disappointing to stop at Invalides for pictures, instead of outside the Eiffel Tower."

This Roastery, sits along side the famous Meguro River Cherry Blossoms Promenade. I heard about this place on Instagram, but the recommendation was not to go during cherry blossoms season. However, that’s exactly when we went cause we came to Japan to see the cherry blossoms.\n No long cues but I did read something on instagram about needing a ticket or something to get in during peak times. We got there at about 11am and were told we needed to find a table before we could order. That took 15 to 20 minutes tops. Ordering took longer cause the line was long but still only took about 35 minutes including getting the order. I swear it took longer to use the bathroom cause there’s always a line for the ladies rooms. I think they only had two stalls on the third floor. Dumb!! Yes people were saving their tables with books, backpacks, coats, etc. WOW! This is probably the only country where you can do that. In the US, it would have been stolen or somebody would’ve moved it and taking the table without a second thought. So hats off to Japan. Seriously would love to live in Japan just to get away from all the violence here, but their system of trains drives me insane. All in all it was a nice experience having never been to a Roastery before, but the desserts are better by far  at the local bakeries. I’ve never been one for the baked goods at Starbucks cause they’re mediocre at best. The coffee was good, but then its Starbucks after all. I would’ve preferred their Sakura specialty drink but unfortunately, that wasn’t offered on the menu or I was ordering on the wrong floor. At least I can say I’ve been to a Starbucks, Roastery, and in Japan no less. Sweet!!\n\nOn your walk back to the train station make sure to check out the little Onigiri Shop along the way. The salmon with salmon roe is amazing and the rice is warm. I just had to give them a shout out."

The entire experience was flawless from check in to check out and nothing was too much trouble. All of the staff were outstanding but I do need to make special mention of Isaac in F&B, Samuel in The Oak Door Restaurant and Ashok in The French Kitchen. You guys rock!

The location is absolutely fantastic, with easy access to nearby attractions and transportation options, making it a perfect base for exploring the city. The staff were outstanding—always friendly, professional, and ready to assist with any request.\n\nOne of the highlights of my stay was the executive lounge. The variety of offerings was impressive, from delicious food options to a well-stocked selection of beverages, all in a relaxing and spacious setting. It really added to the overall experience.\n\nThe room was comfortable and well-appointed, providing everything I needed for a pleasant stay. Combined with the great location and the wonderful service, this hotel is an excellent choice for anyone visiting Tokyo. I’ll definitely be back!"

Service is impeccable at the front desk, concierge desk, breakfast buffet and executive lounge.  Housekeeping was attentive to our requests for extra bedding.  Concierge helped us with arriving packages and making restaurant recommendations / reservations.\n\nThe location of this property couldn't be more perfect, with the underground passage to rail, the 10-minute Shinjuku shuttle, and the quiet business neighborhood.  On this visit we discovered a sprawling peaceful park, with Starbucks and a restaurant (and rare outdoor seating) just half a block away.\n\nGuest rooms are tranquil with no noise from adjacent rooms, bedding is luxurious.  Bathrooms are equipped with all of the Japanese amenities, immediate hot water and great water pressure from shower, bath and sink.  Nespresso coffee maker and electric teapot were greatly appreciated.  More than enough electrical outlets in the room for charging all of our devices.\n\nDefinitely recommend booking with breakfast included, as the buffet cannot be beat.\n\nWe hold the Tokyo Hilton up as one of the very best hotels in which we've ever stayed."

                        "review_text": "tldr: we were underwhelmed by our experience at the Park Hyatt Tokyo and won’t be back again.\n\nCheck-in: The hotel was very disorganized: there are many people in the hotel area frequenting its restaurant, bar and bakery besides the hotel guests; and there were insufficient signs and help from the staff. As we walked in, no one greeted us and we had to ask someone for the specific check-in location (the first person pointed us to the wrong place, a cake pick-up). The building entrance is overall confusing and feels like a convention center - sterile. At check in, we were not offered any help with luggage.\n\nRoom: The room has a great view, but it needs renovation: water leaking from shower stall, bulky wood furniture, torn sofa surfaces, walls with scratches, limited electrical outlets at odd locations, doors making sound when sliding, worn carpets, no rain shower head.\n\nAmenities: The gym and pool are complimentary but has a tiny locker area. For a more spacious and comfortable ladies’ room, you need to pay extra for use of the spa. We felt nickled and dimed especially when comparing to other hotels we’ve stayed at in this trip—saunas, jacuzzi and steam room were complementary elsewhere except for this hotel. On the plus side, the in-room amenities are great: Dyson hair dryer, Bose bluetooth speaker, and aesop toiletries are provided.\n\nDining: The hotel bar “New York bar” had a 45 minute wait when we were there. Hotel guests can wait from the room, but oddly no one told us that. They assumed we were not hotel guests and told us to wait in line.\n\nOverall, we felt the stay did not provide a luxury experience; we did not feel a personal touch in the service, or any service at all. I would rate this hotel as a 3.5-star and not 5-star for what they offer. Feels like a regular Hyatt or Grand Hyatt at best,  As Hyatt loyalists, we felt this property is a huge letdown. Japan and Tokyo in particular have a lot to offer so we would not be back at the PH Tokyo again."

The staff that greeted us was quite stiff yet professional. We were ushered up to our room (just like in St. Regis) and made sure we had everything we needed. \n\nThe location is convenient.  It is just a few mins walk  to restaurants and shops. \n\nThe room was fantastic with a great view! It was spacious. They had luxurious toiletries. Everything was all there. We didn't have to ask for more. They provided a pair of sleeping clothes in case you forget to bring some. \n\nThe staff at the restaurant were all very friendly and attentive.  They provided excellent service. The food was all delicious.\n\nOur experience was great overall. It's worth coming back. \n\nThe room was fantastic with a great view! It was spacious.

                        "review_text": "Currently in the process of renovations, the Park Hyatt Tokyo was a hotel that I long desired to stay in, and the chance to do so finally came after the pandemic restrictions were lifted. I was not disappointed. Even just staying in one of the regular rooms was special and I am glad to have experienced it before the hotel closed.\n\nLocated in the farther end of Shinjuku, the Park Hyatt Tokyo is located in a large office tower, with the main means of getting up to the lobby being an elevator lobby that took me up to the main floor, after which I navigated a series of art-laden corridors to the actual lobby. I was seated and checked at the individual desks that dotted the area. The entry really set the tone for my stay-- just arriving at the hotel and walking up felt exclusive. I was sent my way and received the luggage that the staff had collected from me earlier at the building entrance shortly after arriving at my room.\n\nThe halls and passageways were very elaborate. I could see some being frustrated having to go through several of them to get to their rooms but I dug the vibe. The many pathways also meant that sound couldn't travel very far, meaning that the hotel was intimately quiet outside of the lobby and restaurants.\n\nAs expected, the room was spacious, at least for a Tokyo hotel. While appearing dated (hence the hotel going its refresh now), the furnishings nonetheless look classic and well-maintained. The features one would expect from a luxury hotel were all there and nearly organized. With the Park Hyatt being situated at the top end of the tower, the room came with a panoramic view of Tokyo that's hard to beat; one can get a similar view from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building for free, yes, but one cannot wake up and watch the sun rise from there. The bed and furniture were comfortable and ensured a good night's rest each time. The only complaints I had were the lack of power outlets, which was not surprising given the age of the hotel, and the steep height of the bathtub. I'm sure the renovations will come with many more outlets in each room when they are complete. I'm also sure that even after renovations, I will still have trouble getting in and out of the bathtub, as I cannot magically grow longer legs. Overall, I enjoyed the room and would happily stay in it again.\n\nWhile I didn't make full use of the hotel's food and beverage facilities (there were many and they were all expensive), I did have the chance to sample their room service for lunch and also head up to the New York Bar for a nightcap. I recall that room service menu had many options spread across their restaurants and I had a Croque Monsieur. The sandwich along with a side made for a sumptuous meal that would have easily taken me out for the afternoon had I not resolved to get in some last-minute sightseeing. After coming back from dinner, I went up to the bar for a few drinks. Seating was plentiful when we were arrived, so we settled in and got our orders in quickly. The drinks were expensive (I remember them being between 2,000 and 3,000 Yen per cocktail), but they were delicious and were a small price to pay for the atmosphere, as well as for the nighttime views of Shinjuku. The menu also included snacks and small bites, which were equally expensive, but satisfying. \n\nThroughout my stay, I was greeted and treated warmly by the staff. The service ties everything together; the hotel's facilities were fantastic but they certainly wouldn't be as great without the staff manning them. From check-in to check-out, I had a great time. I hope an opportunity arises to stay here again!"

Wood and furniture worn and scuffed everywhere. Dated design. Even the base rooms are large enough so that was nice. \n\nExpansive views of the city from one side of the hotel, the other mostly just sees other skyrises and a construction site. \n\nSpa was underwhelming and didn’t have a pool which would’ve been nice. The hot tubs weren’t that hot. \n\nConcierge seemed overwhelmed and was hit and miss. Major delays in response time pre-trip. They weren’t able to help with most of my exclusive restaurant and bar requests. They did surprise me with one reservation when I wasn’t able to get it online. \n\nThe restaurants and bar were great. If you can get into pizza bar don’t miss the 3rd best pizza restaurant in the world. Breakfast buffet was too busy some of the days. \n\nService was nice but when we had problems it didn’t seem like they cared. Most of the staff seemed very young. I ultimately had to escalate my issues to management and my travel agent which is the last thing I want to do on vacation, once that happened it at least felt like they tried to make it right."

To be fair we didn’t have to wait long to recover them any time we went out. The other element is the tatami mats in the room. However it does not have the intimate ambiance or dedicated service of a real ryokan. There is no dining room or bar, so breakfast, drinks and any meal must be consumed in your room, with the remnants staying there for some time. We were advised that the two bowls of udon we ordered would take an hour, so we didn’t have any meal except breakfast (ordinary). The bottle of wine we ordered took two phone calls and two visits from staff to establish that it was out of stock. I felt sorry for the poor waiter who tried to open a bottle of champagne with a corkscrew - not his fault that he hadn’t been properly trained. The rooms are fair sized and elegant, and the onsen on the 17th floor is authentic but for the money one can do a lot better in Tokyo. If you want a ryokan experience go to Shiraume in Kyoto and if you want a luxury hotel in Tokyo go to the Gajoen."

To be clear, this hotel is not for everyone. We didn't want a busy hotel like the Mandarin or IC. There are plenty of restaurants and bars all over Tokyo, we wanted a place to breathe and rest when we called it a day. \n\nThe hotel is a traditional Japanese Inn which is unlike any place I have stayed. First, no shoes allowed in the hotel. You check them in by the entrance. If you want to wear other shoes, bring them down by hand. When I read that before staying I was a little apprehensive but after the first time doing so I looked forward to it every time we got back.\n\nThe common area and rooms are immaculate and well designed. Bedroom was spacious and the mattress was quality. Great shower and bathtub and great skin products.\n\nThis hotel is truly an oasis. Tokyo is lively and packed with people. Each floor is secluded and there is a common area with tea, coffee, and snacks. When you walk in you feel like you are entering a high end spa. It is centrally located and has fast access to Tokyo Station and Otemachi subway. The surrounding area is the financial district and gets very quiet at night which is a welcomed breather.\n\nWe went all over Tokyo and the Hoshinoya made it easy to get in and around. I will definitely be back."

We only booked the last stay a few days in advance and then it was almost twice as expensive. There are many good things about the hotel, in addition to the location; The receptionists were friendly. We got free water dispensers in the room and hot and cold drinks at the reception. It was clean and quiet. What we were not so happy with was that the Standard Twin Rooms had an extra bed that took up a lot of space and lacked a proper bathroom. The sink was in the room so it was impractical and there were separate cubicles for the shower and toilet."

A pianist was playing in the extensive lobby lounge when we checked in, setting the most wonderful atmosphere. Everyone on the hotel staff was so especially nice to us the entire time we were there. Kai and Rene (with her especially keen and unique sense of humor) in Cerise made our mornings so much fun and so special. We truly looked forward to breakfast every day thanks to them! Sophie (the Quality Control that we met in Cerise) and Izumi, the Assistant Guest Relations Manager, were truly exceptional, personable, accommodating, welcoming and professional. They made us feel special and at home. Mina in the Executive Lounge was always gracious and outgoing. Finally, our housekeeping staff. Unfortunately, we don’t have our names, but our room was always beautifully taken care of. While the hotel itself is beautiful, these team members make the Conrad Tokyo extraordinary. Lastly, it was a pleasure meeting and speaking to Neil McInnes. The highest compliment we can give him is that he so reminds us of Eric Long, the longtime manager at the Waldorf Astoria in NYC back when it was in operation. The Conrad Tokyo has become one of our very favorite hotels anywhere. We absolutely loved our stay!"

                        "review_text": "Conrad Tokyo is Absolutely the Best!!\n\nHuge credit goes to all of the amazing and wonderful teams:\nReservations: Nadia, Nguyen, Mai\nConcierge: Tomoko, Hanako\nGuest Relations: Fumie\nExecutive Lounge: Mika, Miyuki, Monica, Amika, Fukiko, Rena, Mina, Akiko, Endo Miyuki, Yuka, Sharma, Sho, Saya, Saeka, Fonseca, Tate\n\nFor context, this trip is special for my mother and I because we were supposed to travel here back in March for her birthday and the cherry blossom season as she always wanted to visit Japan. But unfortunately weren't able to celebrate it then. After months of planning, researching, and preparation we decided to stay at the Conrad Tokyo, and had high expectations based on all the previous great reviews. We have been completely floored and overwhelmed at the level of first class service from all of the amazing teams that they provided us everyday during our visit. \n\nEven before arrival, I was in conversations with some of the team (Nadia, Nguyen, Mai, Tomoko, and Hanako). They each provided invaluable helpful insights on questions I asked about the hotel, amenities, location, nearby attractions and more. Not only were they incredibly knowledgeable, but caring, empathetic, and customized their recommendations to our preferences. They even went above and beyond and created super helpful presentations that saved us hours in planning our trip to where to get items we forgot back home! (I do not know anyone who does that)\n\nThen traveling from the US, arriving late, and being jet-lagged, and I was concerned if I had built up the hype too much - and was absolutely awe-struck from the team surpassing them! \n\nLiterally from the moment we stepped foot at the property, we were greeted with unbelievable warmth and hospitality by Rena Nakagawa and the wonderful team. Rena made the check-in process incredibly convenient, simple, and easy. She was also prepared, aware, and took extra initiative to understand how this trip was the first for my mother and provided the best arrangement possible based on our loyalty and preferences to make her stay as comfortable as possible!\n\nWhat is more is that she (and the overall team - Mika, Miyuki, Monica, Amika, Fukiko, Mina, Akiko, Endo Miyuki, Yuka, Sharma, Sho, Saya, Saeka, Fonseca, Tate) always came to us in the lounge to check-in how our stay is, if they and the team can do anything else to make the stay as comfortable as possible. Each one of their attention to care, compassion, emotional intelligence, and thoughtfulness is magnificent and heart-warming (Once again, no one is this attentive and goes this much above and beyond)\n\nAdditionally a situation came up (which happens to most travelers) when you realize you forgot so many items back home. We then met Fumie Murase and were incredibly moved by how attentive and took ownership of the situation from providing invaluable insights to get the needed items - to being so incredibly empathetic and caring when understanding this was a belated birthday trip for my mother. Although it was months ago, she went above and beyond to ensure my mother still got to celebrate her birthday with a wonderful present. \n\nOn top of that, Rena also provided a terrific gift for her. It is those small gestures that make the most significant and substantial impact from the team.\n\nI am sure I am forgetting names (and my sincere apologies as everyone has been absolutely wonderful), but this team of incredibly special talent exemplifies class, empathy, care, and understanding the importance of the customer experience. As someone who has stayed at countless hotels around the world - I have never been so in awe of this level of care, compassion, ownership, knowledge, and class. It is incredibly evident to me that they are the jewels in the crown of Conrad Tokyo and Hilton's overall customer service and ethos, and are incredibly invaluable assets for the organization. \n\nBased on this experience - I have recommended my family and contacts to stay at the Conrad Tokyo solely due to this team's stellar quality of service. There are great customer service professionals in every organization, but I have never been so thoroughly impressed, empowered, and enlightened from customer service experiences such as these. \n\nAs someone who travels internationally frequently, my regret now is that I have not stayed in Tokyo, and especially the Conrad Tokyo before. But that is all changing due to this team's unbelievable warmth, support, and care. My family and I are updating our upcoming travel plans to stay specifically at this property, and hopefully partner with this phenomenal group again (cross-fingers)! Literally the only cons are that from the captivating views and style of the hotel, to especially being treated like family - it makes it very difficult to leave the property! Every time we go out, we are comparing the service, care, views, and food received from the hotel vs other aspects in the city (which are great) - but Conrad Tokyo is simply the best.\n\nI hope the examples set by this team's first class quality of care, service, and help are the benchmark for all services across not only at the Conrad Tokyo , but for every organization - regardless of industry."

If this is your first time attending this sort of display, it might be worthwhile. One thing I wish the website would mention is that you need to remove your shoes and walk through water, several times. Luckily, I was wearing shorts that day. They do offer shorts for rent, but what if someone prefers not to walk in the water? How hygienic is that? Additionally, they should warn people about the bright, flashing lights, as they could be a concern for people with certain health conditions. My friend did not feel well after the second phase/setup but was not much assistance was offered. There was no place to sit or rest, nor was she offered a refund."

We were herded from one room to another by a team member. With school kids and adults, shoving and screaming, it felt more like an overcrowded amusement park than an immersive experience. I was there on a Friday afternoon, wonder if I should have picked a different day. I hope that this review will motivate them amend their rules, restrict the number of tickets, ask guests to maintain silence and perhaps have a different time slot for kids or school trips."

Seemed daunting at first, but as the week went on, started to pick up few tips as we gained more usage experience.\nA few tips.\nAlways find it useful to peruse a decent printed copy of the metro system beforehand, and in Tokyo's case, one which shows the stations alpha numeric code.\nEasiest way to pay fares for us, was the purchase of an IC card on arrival at the airport. We used Welcome Suica which is valid for 28 days from first use. The automatic machines located at Haneda airport are straight forward and easy to use. There is an English language option  available. The machines may say they accept credit cards,but not all international credit cards are accepted. Our VISA card did not work. So best to bring enough Yen notes to first purchase and top up the card. The same machines are located in all the other metro stations we visited, so you can tip up easily and conveniently.  6000 Yen was enough for us for one week, including trip to and from Haneda airport. If topping up card by cash, lowest denomination coin accepted appeared to be 100 yen. You tap in and tap out on each journey at the barriers. The barriers will display balance left on your card each time.\nMetro system is run by two separate companies, but is not really relevant as the IC cards can be used on either system. Each line is named and colour coded. Eg Ginza Line is Orange. Each station on the lines is numbered sequentially from one end to another. So Ginza Line starts at Shibuya (G01) and ends at Asakusa (G19). Ginza station itself is G09, so if travelling from Ginza to Shibuya, you need the platform where the station number stops are going down. \nGinza station itself is an interchange on other lines, so they are coded in similar fashion. So Ginza station on the silver Hibuya line is stop H09.\nSo when first entering the metro, first find the colour circle for the line on the signage, Ginza Line will be an Orange Circle with a G inside. Hibuya line a Silver Circle with a H inside. Pass through the gate barriers for the respective line. Many stations have separate gate barriers for each line if an interchange station.  Large signage on the approach to platforms will show which direction platform you'll need.\nEntering some metro stations at Street Level, you need to ensure you enter from correct side of road as you can't reach the other platform once in the Metro. Hisgashi-Ginza is like this on the A Asakusa line.\nMany Tokyo metro stations are very large with many exits and long walks between interchanges. Some interchanges are two different named stations close together where you will need to exit to street level and walk between. Signage is always very clear.\nOnce on the metro, clear electronic signage announces each stop both in Japanese and English. The alphanumeric station code is also clearly displayed. What is also displayed is an exit plan station layout for each stop.\nRecommend that you use say Google Maps to view your destination station and make a note of the exit number you will need. Some stations have many, many exits going in all compass points. Exits are referenced in Black Font on Yellow background and follow alphanumeric system, ie A5, B10, C3 etc. Knowing the exit you require will save huge amount of time trying to get your bearings as you depart the metro. Especially if you look at the display on the metro train itself as it approaches the station, it will tell you whether you need to go left or right as you leave the train.\nSome exits involve lots of steps, but I think all the stops we used did have elevator access at some exits. These are sometimes marked on Google maps with elevator symbol.\nOnce you have your bearings, you be whizzing around like a local within a day or so.\n"

Negotiating the metro can be daunting but the system is logical and not too difficult to figure out. Routes are mostly circular. Ticket counters have optional English displays. Train and subway lines are colour coded. Stations have a unique symbology and numbering system that makes me wonder why I have not seen this elsewhere. Major routes to airports are marked on the station floor. However, my most memorable experience has to be when a smartly dressed train driver came by and could see my confusion. He asked me where I wanted to go and in perfect English told me which platform to go to! Wow, respect to you and your company JR!"

Tokyo Disney is the only Disney park with a glass overhang on Main Street. The park shops are heavily themed towards confectionaries. If the shop isn't only a confectionary, a huge portion of it will be confectionary. Mobile orders work great and there is a good amount of seating. I was shocked that we only needed to pay for one ride and used the free 40th anniversary pass for another, otherwise we stood in line no more than 20 minutes. The only complaints I have are the number of school kids there and how we could not buy just the popcorn bucket without popcorn and the popcorn tweezers can only be purchased one per bucket. The school kids were a bit rude. They constantly bumped into us, pushed past us, stepped in between us, and tried to cut in line. The popcorn bucket I can understand, they are probably trying to prevent people from buying buckets to sell online or whatnot but we wanted the halloween bucket which we only found at one stand and we had 0 interest in the flavor of it. I planned to buy 3 popcorn tweezers but was only able to but the 1. Loved the park and the experience."

We were met with a racist attitude from Disneyland Park Guest Service supervisor. If you are reading reviews about TDL, you need to realize that even booking a vacation at the TDL resort is an absolute nightmare. Their technology is very poor, outdated and slow. Extremely hard to book a vacation. Our trip is 4 nights, needed to be booked in 2 separate 2 day packages. Incredibly limited park access. Poor information from their website and cast members.  Horrible in park APP, so limited on merchandise, you need to attempt to use a virtual queue. Nightmarish…. Dropped us out of 2 queues. We made a big mistake coming to Japan and visiting TDL. Don’t bother. At least Japanese tourist can know that they will be treated much better in the US than TDL and their countrymen treat Americans. Yes that is another thing that has disappointingly changed….6 years ago I told everyone I knew how poliet people were in Japan…. Not the case anymore. They are rude and inconsiderate."

Ryo is an exceptional teacher (Takumi in Japanese) who combines deep knowledge with incredible patience. Ryo took the time to ensure that I understood and could demonstrate the techniques thoroughly. His English language is exceptional so he was always able to answer questions and offer guidance.\n\nWhat impressed me most was Ryo's ability to create a supportive and encouraging learning environment. I was a complete novice in Shiatsu, having only been trained in Swedish massage previously; Ryo met me at my level and helped me grow. I still have a lot to practice but the way Ryo explained complex concepts in a clear, accessible way made my learning process smooth and enjoyable.\n\nI walked away from the class feeling confident in the skills I had learned. I am planning a follow-up practice class in a few weeks and treat myself to a massage! If you're considering taking a Shiatsu class, I highly recommend learning from Ryo. You won't find a more dedicated or effective English-speaking teacher in Tokyo!"

You can even interact with some of the models, try to lift portable sushi booths and the like.\n\nThe museum is divided in two parts: Edo and Tokyo. The history continues in Tokyo part up to late 20th century and is interesting as such, but I have to admit I went there mostly for the Edo part. The museum shop sells some nice souvenirs at reasonable prices. Overall, a superb museum, highly recommended!"

They do offer shorts for rent, but what if someone prefers not to walk in the water? How hygienic is that?

As we walked in, no one greeted us and we had to ask someone for the specific check-in location (the first person pointed us to the wrong place, a cake pick-up). The building entrance is overall confusing and feels like a convention center - sterile. At check in, we were not offered any help with luggage.\n\nRoom: The room has a great view, but it needs renovation: water leaking from shower stall, bulky wood furniture, torn sofa surfaces, walls with scratches, limited electrical outlets at odd locations, doors making sound when sliding, worn carpets, no rain shower head.\n\nAmenities: The gym and pool are complimentary but has a tiny locker area. For a more spacious and comfortable ladies’ room, you need to pay extra for use of the spa. We felt nickled and dimed especially when comparing to other hotels we’ve stayed at in this trip—saunas, jacuzzi and steam room were complementary elsewhere except for this hotel. On the plus side, the in-room amenities are great: Dyson hair dryer, Bose bluetooth speaker, and aesop toiletries are provided.\n\nDining: The hotel bar “New York bar” had a 45 minute wait when we were there. Hotel guests can wait from the room, but oddly no one told us that. They assumed we were not hotel guests and told us to wait in line.\n\nOverall, we felt the stay did not provide a luxury experience; we did not feel a personal touch in the service, or any service at all. I would rate this hotel as a 3.5-star and not 5-star for what they offer. Feels like a regular Hyatt or Grand Hyatt at best,  As Hyatt loyalists, we felt this property is a huge letdown. Japan and Tokyo in particular have a lot to offer so we would not be back at the PH Tokyo again."

                        "review_text": "Currently in the process of renovations, the Park Hyatt Tokyo was a hotel that I long desired to stay in, and the chance to do so finally came after the pandemic restrictions were lifted. I was not disappointed. Even just staying in one of the regular rooms was special and I am glad to have experienced it before the hotel closed.\n\nLocated in the farther end of Shinjuku, the Park Hyatt Tokyo is located in a large office tower, with the main means of getting up to the lobby being an elevator lobby that took me up to the main floor, after which I navigated a series of art-laden corridors to the actual lobby. I was seated and checked at the individual desks that dotted the area. The entry really set the tone for my stay-- just arriving at the hotel and walking up felt exclusive. I was sent my way and received the luggage that the staff had collected from me earlier at the building entrance shortly after arriving at my room.\n\nThe halls and passageways were very elaborate. I could see some being frustrated having to go through several of them to get to their rooms but I dug the vibe. The many pathways also meant that sound couldn't travel very far, meaning that the hotel was intimately quiet outside of the lobby and restaurants.\n\nAs expected, the room was spacious, at least for a Tokyo hotel. While appearing dated (hence the hotel going its refresh now), the furnishings nonetheless look classic and well-maintained. The features one would expect from a luxury hotel were all there and nearly organized. With the Park Hyatt being situated at the top end of the tower, the room came with a panoramic view of Tokyo that's hard to beat; one can get a similar view from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building for free, yes, but one cannot wake up and watch the sun rise from there. The bed and furniture were comfortable and ensured a good night's rest each time. The only complaints I had were the lack of power outlets, which was not surprising given the age of the hotel, and the steep height of the bathtub. I'm sure the renovations will come with many more outlets in each room when they are complete. I'm also sure that even after renovations, I will still have trouble getting in and out of the bathtub, as I cannot magically grow longer legs. Overall, I enjoyed the room and would happily stay in it again.\n\nWhile I didn't make full use of the hotel's food and beverage facilities (there were many and they were all expensive), I did have the chance to sample their room service for lunch and also head up to the New York Bar for a nightcap. I recall that room service menu had many options spread across their restaurants and I had a Croque Monsieur. The sandwich along with a side made for a sumptuous meal that would have easily taken me out for the afternoon had I not resolved to get in some last-minute sightseeing. After coming back from dinner, I went up to the bar for a few drinks. Seating was plentiful when we were arrived, so we settled in and got our orders in quickly. The drinks were expensive (I remember them being between 2,000 and 3,000 Yen per cocktail), but they were delicious and were a small price to pay for the atmosphere, as well as for the nighttime views of Shinjuku. The menu also included snacks and small bites, which were equally expensive, but satisfying. \n\nThroughout my stay, I was greeted and treated warmly by the staff. The service ties everything together; the hotel's facilities were fantastic but they certainly wouldn't be as great without the staff manning them. From check-in to check-out, I had a great time. I hope an opportunity arises to stay here again!"

Wonderfully tasty and very tender it probably was as good as the Wagyu Steak that was also on the the menu, but that we didn‘t have. The deserts could be improved upon, but that really didn’t matter anymore. \nWe have eaten in many Michelin-star restaurants and the London certainly deserves one.\nLast but not least, I need to mention the very professional but still very personal staff, especially the chef and his wife."

The atmosphere was pleasant and the front of house staff friendly. \nWe had a 3 course including cocktail set menu as a gift. \nThe cocktails were very nice but a limited choice. \nWe were slightly disappointed of the number of items on the set menu that required a supplementary charge especially that no side dishes were included. For a set menu at a steak house restaurant it was surprising that only the rump steak was an option without additional and that option was literally just the steak. All sides including chips were additional charge of £8.50 each. \nThe waiter Oveen was friendly and gave us plenty of time to choose our courses and we never felt rushed. \nOverall I would recommend but be warned the additional charges are significant."

Room service included a tragic miniature £14 ham and cheese toastie that looked like it was stolen from little Johnny’s lunchbox. What is going on at this 5 star hotel? Even the premier inn would be ashamed. Then there was interminable buzzing in the room every 5/10 mins so difficulty sleeping. Gritty oysters was a first at a restaurant where I swear some of the staff looked like they wanted to taser the guests. Not friendly. Breakfast was another shambles passed from empty uncleared restaurant to another. Only saving grace was Scarfs Bar where you needed a drink after all the above. Rosewood? More Deadwood. Avoid."

Staff are friendly and helpful, am Bonvoy Silver and requested a 2pm checkout for my 2 night stay which was granted with no fuss. Comfortable room although basement room I was given was a bit dark and a -slightly- musty smell, TV a bit dated. Great location near Earls Court tube! -plenty of pubs/restaurants/shops nearby- and price was competitive. Am staying again in December."

                        "review_text": "I stayed two nights in the Kensington Grand Park Hotel and it was my worst experience with any Marriott Hotel ever. I had booked two months in advance. On checkin I did not get an a room upgrade as a Bonvoy member - which is ok as its subject to availability. But instead I was downgraded. I was put into a basement room, under the restaurant kitchen with a window to a a dirty light shaft. While the room itself was clean, the whole area in the basement was damp, smelly and the hallway dirty. WiFi did not work in my room and as it was in the basement, there was no cellular reception either. Whenever the kitchen flushed warter, it sounded like it was coming down into my room. Also, there are no power outlets anywhere near the bed to charge a phone. \nI would have loved to show the manager on duty the room and try him to explain what the „superior room“ features were. But the Management was not on duty when I arrived in the evening, not when I left the next morning, not when I came back the next evening and not on the morning of checkout. The receptionists apologized but could only put me in a better room the next day.\nI arrived and checked in at the Hotel around 8pm on 2024-09-16. My reservation was done and confirmed 2024-07-24, so nearly 2 months before. With a reservation roughly two months in advance and bonvoy gold status, I really expect more than the worst and least room in the hotel.\nOn checkout, I again stated I wanted to speak to management, but they were unavailable.I insisted, that I am not willing to pay full price (507 GBP = 614 Euro) for this, but the front desk said they could do nothing about it as the amount was already charged on the credit card upon arrival. I was also not given a printed receipt/invoice for the stay, which I need for my bookkeeping/tax office, as the front desk said their system was not working at that time. They promised to send the receipt via email. They also promised that Management would follow up with me via email. Neither happened. Nothing.\nMy email address is very well on file with the hotel, as the booking was from the Mariott Website, logged in to bonvoy which has all the required info. They also read out my correct email out to me during checkin, so it is very well in their system.\nNot providing a receipt, not following up on the stay and complaints leaves a VERY bad taste.Please get in touch with me to discuss how to resolve this situation."

The trip was broken into two separate stays at the beginning and end of the trip. \n\nThe first 3 nights, I had a room in the basement.  Let's just say avoid this area at all costs. Getting to the room was a chore, as the elevator didn't go there, and there were several flights of stairs and multiple fire doors. The room and hallways stink of mold and mildew. The room was kept clean, but everything was just shabby. \n\nI got a room on the 5th floor on the tail end. This room was much better,  but the bathroom was showing signs of mold. \n\nThe attached restaurant is separate,  so charging to the room is not an option.  The food and service were very good. \n\nThe only saving grace for the hotel was that the staff were very friendly."

                        "review_text": "This hotel needs to understand the term service.  The room was OK, the location OK but the level of service for a hotel attracting this price was abysmal -  I arrived to a receptionist who tried 3 times to allocate me to a room in the basement with no windows.  I eventually was given a room on the first floor - the amenities in the room were no better than a motel with an empty fridge set to minimum temperature so pretty useless, cheap coffee n tea and no water.  I called the ' so called room service' for water and was told 'we don't provide water you will have to call the restaurant.'  I did and was presented with a luke warm bottle of water I had to pay for at my room door as the restaurant is a separate business!  I then discovered the Wi-Fi did not work as too many users on it at the same time the response to this was to send the receptionist to my room who had no knowledge of how to get it started and could only suggest I move rooms.  At this point I only had 45 mins left to get ready to go out.  I then got a call from front desk asking if I would meet with the Duty Manager, which I agreed to do if I had time, which I didn't, as he arrived in reception as my driver turned up.  Could it get any worse - oh YES.  On my return to the hotel I asked the front desk to order me a cab for the morning.  At 1.30am they decided to call the room to tell me Uber was not answering the phone and I would have to call the front desk again in the morning.  I slept well (only saving grace) then repeated my cab request to the morning staff who sorted it, but does it end there oh NO.  The Mini cab driver, did not know London, needed to rely on satnav and when got to my destination he struggled to find anywhere to pull over so took me on a 15-minute circuit of Euston whilst on the phone to a courier who was trying to deliver something to his house.  I eventually got out of the car, a 15-minute walk away from my desired location.  To say this was an uncomfortable journey, after a very poor overnight stay is an understatement.  Def NOT recommend."

A little updating will fix this problem.  The hotel was clean otherwise.  \n\nAs gold members, we had free breakfast every morning.  No perks or upgrades for gold other than breakfast.  However, the breakfast was very good.  They saved all their good staff members for that because everyone there was very nice and helpful.  The breakfast was also very good!\n\nOverall, the hotel was sufficient for what we needed but definitely needs updating.  The location is good.  It is right next to the tube and Tower of London.  \n\nAlso, make sure to not touch the laundry bag in the room.  We were going to get some laundry done but ended up not having enough time because we had to leave a day early.  The bag was wrinkled (it was a paper bag) because we had put the laundry in it, so we did not hang it back up.  It was in the room, but not back on the hanger.  They charged us 10 pounds for the paper laundry bag!  There should be a sign on the closet door stating that - we would have re-hung the wrinkled bag!  \n\nOverall, we would probably not stay there again with the many other choices available, but it was okay.  When all of the updates are completed, it will probably be much better."

We aren't tourists but, if you are, the location is perfect for The Tower Of London, Tower Bridge and all things in that area of London. The room was clean, comfy and the staff were welcoming, efficient and helpful. If you fancy a tipple, the bar is fab with great views over the Tower and the Thames. Heartily recommended."

Throughout our stay, everyone we met was so polite, friendly, and professional. A lot of the team even wished us a happy birthday, which made the experience feel really personal.\n\nAs parents, this was a rare child-free getaway, and it turned out to be one of the most relaxing and enjoyable breaks we’ve had in ages. The attention to detail the hotel has and the effort from the team didn’t go unnoticed—we felt so well looked after.\n\nThank you to everyone at the Royal Lancaster for making our weekend so memorable.

Pre arrival was great, had great expectations but on arrival we found out that all communication up front was useless… we were a group of 10 with 5 deluxe rooms but nothing had been done with our (approved) request  for twin beds.\nThen at the bar we waited for a beer with the bartender getting 2 bottles and then did other orders before just grabbing the other 8 bottles out of the fridge. Why?\nIn the evening I must say they did arrange twin beds but  what I find the most shocking is that they put some of us in a classic room and not in the paid for deluxe room! \nThis cannot be true? I travel a lot and am a luxury travel host but I have never experienced this in a 5 star hotel.\nGreat breakfast, classic rooms are great and staff is friendly but too many misses to be recommended. Great value for money but not the luxury feel and service from renowned labels in the city."

As it was my wife’s birthday, we were welcome with a glass of Prosecco before going up to our room. \nI booked a Deluxe room with a river view and it was beyond what we expected. The view was absolutely beautiful and it was so peaceful and quiet. The room was spotless and although it advertised the bed as a queen bed, it felt more like a super king sized bed.\nA coffee machine with capsules is available, as well as a mini bar fridge. \nThe TV has all functions to stream off your phone if you need to and there is an indoor heating/cooling which goes from 19 degrees up to 24. It didn’t appear to be an a/c but as it was mild out, we didn’t really need it.\nThe bathroom was equipped with all towels, soap and complimentary shampoo and shower gel.\n\nHousekeeping did a great job making it all look great and clean again, replenishing towels and coffee capsules.\n\nThe breakfast buffet was absolutely amazing, ranging from all juices and coffees to hot and cold dishes. You can also order things such as avocado with poached eggs etc but the breakfast was more than enough for us.\n\nThe fact that you could WhatsApp reception or concierge whilst you’re staying with anything you needed and they responded really quickly was so helpful. \n\nI have no complaints and if I had to give some feedback it’s to get more elevators working, there were 4 but one was out of service. \nWe would definitely return and the entire experience was great. Beautiful hotel, quiet but local enough with staff who have excellent knowledge and customer service."

We took advantage of a special offer so stayed for 4 nights for the price of 3.  \nThis hotel is so well placed for easy access to Oxford Street and beyond. Only a five minute walk to Oxford Circus underground. \nWe stayed in an executive room so had access to the lounge where food and drink are served. This was I think our fourth or fifth stay and staff greet you as old friends and it was lovely to see some the same people. Gee (not sure of spelling) from Latvia makes a great passion fruit martini and was amazing as everyone is. Ivan (the terrible) is not at all terrible and makes a mean Tom Collins.  He anticipates your every need and the service from all staff is second to none. Would highly recommend upgrading to an executive room. \nThe rooms are so comfy and the housekeeping team are very helpful and were happy to get us extras of things we asked for. The bookmarks in the room have seeds in them so when you finish using it you can plant them, I can’t wait to see the flowers that appear. \nThe check in process was quick and efficient and the team are happy to look after your bags until your room is ready and they were waiting in our room when we returned.\nWould recommend using the pool and gym, well I used the pool and my sister used the gym, maybe next time. \nThe Christmas trees and decorations were amazing and loved to see them.\nWe will be back, think this is my happy place!! \nThank you to everyone in the hotel you are all amazing."

The location is incredible: at the top of Regent Street, only minutes away from Oxford Circus tube station. We spent most of our time out reconnecting with wonderful London, but it was easy to pop back to the hotel for a break during the day when we needed one.\n\nWe qualified for The Langham Club lounge and had our breakfasts there. We required vegan and gluten-free food and I'm glad to say that The Langham rose to the challenge and gave us tasty smashed avocado toast and delicious creamy mushrooms. My son's normally bottomless appetite was satisfied as plenty of food was on offer. Each morning, we were ably looked after by our cheerful and helpful waiter, Luis. In fact, all of the staff we met during our stay were extremely warm and welcoming.\n\nOur room was spotlessly clean and well kitted out with everything we needed. The attention to detail was superb: the bed was turned down at night, Classic FM was switched on and playing softly in the background, a fresh bamboo pillow was left on the bath each evening, a plate of delicious fruit placed on the desk. With the hotel being quiet and the beds comfortable, we slept really well. What a relaxing, stress-free visit we had. Thank you to all at The Langham."

This was our seventh visit to the city and we enjoy trying different properties each time. The Langham turned out to be an excellent choice because, as I said in the title of the review, it was a perfect mix of both traditional English style and modern facilities and amenities. \nOur room was excellent and had an extremely comfortable bed, very nice furnishings and a fully equipped and spacious bathroom.\nThe staff at the hotel really were wonderful from the front desk staff to the concierge, the housekeepers, bell staff and all. They really made us feel welcome and appreciated.  \nThe location of the hotel is great too as it i located at the top of Regent Street and we were able to walk everywhere that we were interested in."

We have stayed in many hotels over the years and I can honestly say the service at the Kimpton was the best we’ve ever had.

The rooms are clean and spacious, especially compared to other budget hotels I've used. Beds are comfortable and I always have a quiet nights sleep here.\n\nBack to the title of my review... I generally have a warm welcome from everyone on checking in but the stand out people are Niv and Lachu. Thanks for making my weekly stint of having to commute to the office a little more brighter and happier, it's much appreciated!\n\nJohn G"

I cannot thank you enough, the experience was incredible, I've not stayed in a room like it before, especially on a boat. We were both over joyed and the whole evening and night stay was so special, followed by a lovely breakfast in the morning. Everything in the suite was of a very high standard, very clean and all working.

Yet the other side of the doors is a warm, calm and friendly atmosphere.  The staff are impeccable, very efficient, attentive but not too intrusive, friendly, polite and genuine.  Our visit coincided with the Christmas decorations being up, so much to admire.  We ate from the Christmas lunch set menu which was excellent.  Generous portions of well cooked food, beautifully presented with lots of flair.  With apologies to family this was the best Christmas lunch we had ever eaten.  Full marks!"

The following day I experienced the amazing spa and had a facial. We also had breakfast in the North Hall and lunch in the Garden restaurant.  We really didn’t want to leave or go anywhere else. The service was outstanding throughout the hotel. The staff are knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. In particular we would like to mention Marco de Simone who welcomed us and made us feel like VIPs!! \nWe will definitely be returning and have already booked lunch in the North Hall with our family in December."

During the 30-minute ride, you'll be able to see London's well-known buildings like Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, and The Shard.

London Eye can be reached easily by taking the Tube to Waterloo station. You might want to buy fast-track passes online in advance to skip the queues. – Tripadvisor",

While very impressive from the outside there is not a terrible amount to see or do on the inside.  Definitely not worth the cost of entry.\n\nDespite having a timed ticket for later in the day, they were quite flexible on entering earlier.\n\nI spent maybe 2 hours there.  There were neat things like the Tower Crows, the graffiti from the prisoners, the armor and coin machines.  The crown jewels were kind of eh as compared to the French crown jewels.\n\nThis is more worth a stop at as an add on to other things in the area .\n\n- Food: There are fantastic and reasonably priced Fish and Chips stands right outside, next to the on site box office.\n- The London Wall is right near the entry/exit of the subway station\n-  Tower Bridge - quick and easy walk to and across from the Tower\n\nOther easy walking distance attractions:\n- The Clink Prison Museum\n- Jack the Ripper Museum\n- The Borough\n- All Hallows by the Tower\n- St Dunstan in the East Church Garden\n- Church of Saint Magnus the Martyr"

I wanna start with people who does not have problem with the line is using from central london zone 1 area or from hounslow/heathrow side but i unfortunately use it from Rayners Lane/Uxbridge side. For commute to work i only take this from Sudbury Hill to rayners lane and it takes me more than 10 mins for the 2 stops because of the red lights or whatever reason. I get cofused sometimes that i went pass these 2 stops but have not even reach the first stop. You have to wait 10 minutes each time for the train to arrive and when they do come the next on is after 2 minutes, it is ridicuolous. You waited kong enough for 10 mins then next one is arriving in 2 minutes so basically everyone jumps into the first train the 2 mins later train will be empty with less passengers. And ofcourse if you miss that then good luck waiting for another 10 minutes again.\nI have use Metro line for a couple years as i moved out from my family home and they are proper good, i mean you do faces like this but very rarely. Picadilly line are only good for the heathrow side because they give priority for the airport so for example from acton town most picadilly lines you will get is for Heathrow not Uxbridge/Rayners Lane. And ofcourse travelling around zone 1 in picadilly lines is not an issue because multiple trains from all side feeds into central area.\nJust fyi, you can get refunds for delays from tfl website but you cannot get the time back unfortunately. Who likes to run late to work due to delays right?"

It was 2pm on Saturday of a long weekend in the summer and no negotiating on prices? What will happen to the produce if left unsold? A gentleman was selling balsamic vinegar and had no bread for tasting. Furtermore, it was sold as Tuscan product from Modena (a lesson in geography would help). \nAnyway, if you want grocery store products sold at individual stalls, this is your place. I would rather go to Farmboy or Remark Farms."

I think their walks are a great way to learn about specific neighborhoods or themes (e.g. the Blitz, Marylebone, etc).\n\nI took a Hampstead Village walk with Richard III (there are 5 Richards who are leaders) which was great.  I particularly enjoyed it because we did a fair amount of walking, versus standing in one spot for 20 minutes while the leader talks.  It's an area that would probably be difficult to do on your own since you wouldn't know what streets to walk down, where to turn or what you're looking at.  He had a wealth of background information about the history and inhabitants which helped paint a picture of the area through the ages.  He didn't seem to appreciate questions - I guess because sometimes they interrupted his flow but it was a great walk.  At the end, he offered suggestions for places to eat and transportation options."

On checkin I did not get an a room upgrade as a Bonvoy member - which is ok as its subject to availability. But instead I was downgraded. I was put into a basement room, under the restaurant kitchen with a window to a a dirty light shaft. While the room itself was clean, the whole area in the basement was damp, smelly and the hallway dirty. WiFi did not work in my room and as it was in the basement, there was no cellular reception either. Whenever the kitchen flushed warter, it sounded like it was coming down into my room. Also, there are no power outlets anywhere near the bed to charge a phone. \nI would have loved to show the manager on duty the room and try him to explain what the „superior room“ features were. But the Management was not on duty when I arrived in the evening, not when I left the next morning, not when I came back the next evening and not on the morning of checkout. The receptionists apologized but could only put me in a better room the next day.\nI arrived and checked in at the Hotel around 8pm on 2024-09-16. My reservation was done and confirmed 2024-07-24, so nearly 2 months before. With a reservation roughly two months in advance and bonvoy gold status, I really expect more than the worst and least room in the hotel.\nOn checkout, I again stated I wanted to speak to management, but they were unavailable.I insisted, that I am not willing to pay full price (507 GBP = 614 Euro) for this, but the front desk said they could do nothing about it as the amount was already charged on the credit card upon arrival. I was also not given a printed receipt/invoice for the stay, which I need for my bookkeeping/tax office, as the front desk said their system was not working at that time. They promised to send the receipt via email. They also promised that Management would follow up with me via email. Neither happened. Nothing.\nMy email address is very well on file with the hotel, as the booking was from the Mariott Website, logged in to bonvoy which has all the required info. They also read out my correct email out to me during checkin, so it is very well in their system.\nNot providing a receipt, not following up on the stay and complaints leaves a VERY bad taste.Please get in touch with me to discuss how to resolve this situation."

I eventually was given a room on the first floor - the amenities in the room were no better than a motel with an empty fridge set to minimum temperature so pretty useless, cheap coffee n tea and no water.  I called the ' so called room service' for water and was told 'we don't provide water you will have to call the restaurant.'  I did and was presented with a luke warm bottle of water I had to pay for at my room door as the restaurant is a separate business!  I then discovered the Wi-Fi did not work as too many users on it at the same time the response to this was to send the receptionist to my room who had no knowledge of how to get it started and could only suggest I move rooms.  At this point I only had 45 mins left to get ready to go out.  I then got a call from front desk asking if I would meet with the Duty Manager, which I agreed to do if I had time, which I didn't, as he arrived in reception as my driver turned up.  Could it get any worse - oh YES.  On my return to the hotel I asked the front desk to order me a cab for the morning.  At 1.30am they decided to call the room to tell me Uber was not answering the phone and I would have to call the front desk again in the morning.  I slept well (only saving grace) then repeated my cab request to the morning staff who sorted it, but does it end there oh NO.  The Mini cab driver, did not know London, needed to rely on satnav and when got to my destination he struggled to find anywhere to pull over so took me on a 15-minute circuit of Euston whilst on the phone to a courier who was trying to deliver something to his house.  I eventually got out of the car, a 15-minute walk away from my desired location.  To say this was an uncomfortable journey, after a very poor overnight stay is an understatement.  Def NOT recommend."

A little updating will fix this problem.  The hotel was clean otherwise.  \n\nAs gold members, we had free breakfast every morning.  No perks or upgrades for gold other than breakfast.  However, the breakfast was very good.  They saved all their good staff members for that because everyone there was very nice and helpful.  The breakfast was also very good!\n\nOverall, the hotel was sufficient for what we needed but definitely needs updating.  The location is good.  It is right next to the tube and Tower of London.  \n\nAlso, make sure to not touch the laundry bag in the room.  We were going to get some laundry done but ended up not having enough time because we had to leave a day early.  The bag was wrinkled (it was a paper bag) because we had put the laundry in it, so we did not hang it back up.  It was in the room, but not back on the hanger.  They charged us 10 pounds for the paper laundry bag!  There should be a sign on the closet door stating that - we would have re-hung the wrinkled bag!  \n\nOverall, we would probably not stay there again with the many other choices available, but it was okay.  When all of the updates are completed, it will probably be much better."

We aren't tourists but, if you are, the location is perfect for The Tower Of London, Tower Bridge and all things in that area of London.

Why?\nIn the evening I must say they did arrange twin beds but  what I find the most shocking is that they put some of us in a classic room and not in the paid for deluxe room! \nThis cannot be true? I travel a lot and am a luxury travel host but I have never experienced this in a 5 star hotel.\nGreat breakfast, classic rooms are great and staff is friendly but too many misses to be recommended. Great value for money but not the luxury feel and service from renowned labels in the city."

I wanna start with people who does not have problem with the line is using from central london zone 1 area or from hounslow/heathrow side but i unfortunately use it from Rayners Lane/Uxbridge side. For commute to work i only take this from Sudbury Hill to rayners lane and it takes me more than 10 mins for the 2 stops because of the red lights or whatever reason. I get cofused sometimes that i went pass these 2 stops but have not even reach the first stop. You have to wait 10 minutes each time for the train to arrive and when they do come the next on is after 2 minutes, it is ridicuolous. You waited kong enough for 10 mins then next one is arriving in 2 minutes so basically everyone jumps into the first train the 2 mins later train will be empty with less passengers. And ofcourse if you miss that then good luck waiting for another 10 minutes again.\nI have use Metro line for a couple years as i moved out from my family home and they are proper good, i mean you do faces like this but very rarely. Picadilly line are only good for the heathrow side because they give priority for the airport so for example from acton town most picadilly lines you will get is for Heathrow not Uxbridge/Rayners Lane. And ofcourse travelling around zone 1 in picadilly lines is not an issue because multiple trains from all side feeds into central area.\nJust fyi, you can get refunds for delays from tfl website but you cannot get the time back unfortunately. Who likes to run late to work due to delays right?"

I opted for the Ceviche Amarillo de Corvina, Magret de Pato Asado, and Cheesecake Bibo de Queso Payoyo.

The food was nice but I had the impression that the chef was trying to impress the guests with all kinds of \"exclusive\" taste combinations, hoping to filter out 2 or 3 that could stay. My #1 suggestion is to spend time more looking in their pans than on their spotwatch, because that was my biggest complaint. We were in and out in 1 hour 20 (starter and main course!), thanks to staff constantly looking to take away empty plates (getting ready for the 2nd shift?).

The staff's hospitality is notable from the moment you arrive, with no wait and a warm welcome. \n\nHowever, while the menu features a variety of well-executed dishes, the sushi offerings, particularly at their price point, did not meet our expectations for quality. The Otoro tuna was a highlight, yet overall, the sushi lacked the exceptional taste and refinement one might anticipate given the cost.\n\nFor those considering a visit, Zuma excels in many areas, but if sushi is your primary interest, it may be worth exploring other options in the city.

We ordered everything the head chef recommended. Highlights include: scallops, octopus (biggest and best I’ve ever had), artichokes and beef tartar that melt in your mouth. There were five of us so we ordered a T Bone and a ribeye. The meet was perfectly cooked (medium rare, on the rarer side how we like it). The beef was incredibly flavorful and you could taste the difference of their specially selected wood for their grill fires. We paired the meal with two bottles of a reserve Rioja. The dessert was a terrific way to end the evening. \n\nThe service was impeccable and proactive. My mom speaks Spanish very well, but she is not Spanish and she speaks slowly. Often times servers speak quickly with no regard to her comprehension. The servers spent time with us, shared their story and genuinely seemed to enjoy our company. \n\nFar and away one of the best dining experiences we have ever had.

Its prime location in the heart of Madrid, its exclusive entrance, its 76 elegantly appointed rooms, the stunning Terraza (rooftop terrace,7th floor) with what may be the best views in Madrid, and its Ático (penthouse, 6th floor) where avant-garde haute cuisine meets classic cocktails in a space with the best music are reasons enough not to miss the opportunity of discovering this renovated building, now one of the capital’s must-see sights. The hotel’s impressive Ático and Terraza boast the best panoramic views of downtown Madrid. In both, amid large, lush garden areas, you can sip a cocktail or order from the menu concocted by Ramón Freixa (2 Michelin stars), soak up some sun in the Solarium or enjoy the sound of the overflow pool and the best ambient music or our outdoor showers in summer… and always with the finest service to ensure that your every wish is granted.",

The pool is only a dipping pool, so don't hold your breath on that one, but it's good for that Instagram shot. We didn't dine in the restaurant, so can't give an opinion on that, but the room was well stocked with everything you might need, and there is a water fountain on every floor to fill up your water bottles.

                        "review_text": "This hotel has a big issue with the room temperature. They don’t allow you to change the temperature from the room, you have to call the front desk and then they call some other department. So each time you feel the temperature isn’t right, for example at 1:00 am when your small child is sleeping in the room, you have to make a phone call that may wake everyone up instead of using the thermostat on the wall. They do have one, but it’s fake. It doesn’t actually change the temperature. \n\nOn our first night here the room was almost 23 degrees. After thinking I could change it myself and it waiting a few hours wondering why it wouldn’t work, I called. They then lowered it. An hour later my room was 18 degrees and we were freezing. I called again and they explained they are the ones that can change it, not you in your own room where you’re sleeping. The man was very rude.By then it was already 11:00 pm and we couldn’t sleep due to the ridiculous temperatures. They said they would set it at 20. \n\nAnother hour goes by and the temperature is still 18.5 which is about 64 Fahrenheit. I call again, still unable to sleep and they say again they’re going to adjust it. Then a few minutes later someone knocks on my door, past midnight, asking if I called for an issue with the tv!!! Meanwhile the issue I did have wasn’t being resolved. \n\nI would caution guests to not stay here if they want to sleep at all. It has been an absolute nightmare.\n\nThe hotel is also mostly catering to people from outside so if you need a table at the rooftop or at the lobby restaurant you have absolutely no priority being a hotel guest. In fact if you are a guest waiting in the lobby for any reason, they will tell you very rudely to move because the tables are reserved for outsiders who have reservations and you can’t sit there to wait for your taxi even though they don’t have any other seating for their own guests.\n\nEvery single decent hotel I have stayed at gives its guests priority for all hotel amenities. This place has no idea what customer service means for a luxury hotel, which clearly they are not."

But my experience in this hotel is different which made me to thank its management and also Guest Experience Department specifically Cristina and Lidia. We stayed at the hotel for 5 days and on November 8th we left to Istanbul to spend several days there. The day after we arrived in Istanbul I realized that I left one of my Hermes bags in our room at the hotel. I was so disappointed but called the hotel and put the Massage for Guest service and unbelievably they answered me that they found my bag🥹. Also they told me that they can keep it for 2 months or arrange with a shipping company to send it to me. I’m a frequent traveler all over the world and absolutely It was one of my best experiences. One more time I want to thank Bless hotel management and staff, specifically dear Cristina and Lidia at Guest experience department."

I was on the 2nd floor facing the road and didn’t hear any noise. Extremely central. Lobby bar gets busy on the weekend with young people."

Unfortunately down the drain... and I literally just checked in.\n\nI checked in early to be told that I was upgraded to one of the Suites that wasn't ready to be occupied yet. I told them it was fine, I'll just go out and get lunch first. Around an hour later, the app told me it was ready for check-in, I came back to the hotel, received my key, and got into the room.\n\nThe staff told me that the bag was already on the way to my room and I should just wait in my room. I waited for 20 minutes and my luggages still didn't arrive, so I came to the receptionist and ask them if I can just bring the luggages on my own because it took them too long. I waited for another 10 minutes before the manager and the staffs - now more people are coming - said that the bags were already in my room.\n\nThe manager then said to me the delay was because I was having an issue with my original room and they had to figure out which room I moved to to deliver my luggages. For me, this was such a huge accusation because I never - at any point during check-in - had any problem with my room. I was simply waiting for too long for my luggages and I just want to get them as quickly as possible into my room.\n\nI literally just checked into this hotel and the check-in experience has been extremely dismal to a point that it has soured my experience before I even get to experience my stay here. To say that this hotel is, so far, all styles over substance seems to be true. Unless everything is so spectacular for the next couple of days, I will never stay in this hotel again because this is a hotel with slow service and the staffs will accuse you for something you never said or did in the first place."

It’s also surprising how worn the hotel already is, considering it’s only 2 years old. If you’re visiting Madrid and are considering staying here, I would recommend checking Urso Hotel before you book — a much better hotel on all accounts."

There was absolutely no mention of the renovation when I booked (otherwise I wouldn’t have booked!) nor any communication in the lead up to our stay. The experience is not worth it for the premium price. \n\nFirstly, the front of house staff (reception, security and porters) were not as attentive or friendly as I would have expected of a Westin hotel. They looked annoyed to be there, and treated you as such. Besides one of the younger staff members, there were no friendly smiles or hellos to be had by the staff in the lobby area. \n\nThe lobby is a makeshift space in an old function area. \nThe reason I booked the Westin was for the beautiful La Rotonda, but this is also currently under renovation. \nBreakfast is served in another function room with no windows or natural light. \nTo get to your room, you’ll have to navigate a confusing route via a couple of different lifts. \nFinding your way to the gym is even more confusing. \nTo top it off, majority of the roads surrounding the hotel were under construction so getting a taxi to/from the Westin was not easy. \n\nWhen I gave feedback on the disappointment of the renovation and the lack of transparency/communication about the ongoing renovation, the staff agreed and was also disappointed that there was no communication about the renovation. Looks like it might be a head office decision? \n\nOn the upside, the rooms are beautiful and the decorative details are very complimentary of the style. The location is great and close to everything you need. The cleaners were super friendly, and the staff on breakfast were great!"

The breakfast buffet is too good and my waisline shows it.  I do not know her name but a young woman who took me to my table each day was a joy to start the day with.  The concierge Oscar was very helpful and had great recommendations.  Housekeeping is spectacular.

We stayed as a family with teens for 3 nights this past June and Four Seasons Madrid is one of our top hotels that we've ever stayed in and perhaps, the top.  We have stayed at Waldorfs, Ritzs, Rosewoods, Fairmonts, LHCs and various independent high quality hotels; all of whom are lovely.  But Four Seasons Madrid was truly special.  \n\nIt is gorgeously designed and a great location.  The beds were clean and comfortable.  Everything was immaculate.  They couldn't have been kinder to us Americans.  While my teenage daughter fits in perfectly with style and class, I'm not so hip and lean more to comfort clothes, no makeup, and no flash and their treatment to each one of us was spectacular.  Maybe any negative reviews are the result of ones behavior to others because we were only treated as royalty.\n\nWho to thank?  I always regret forgetting names, but we remember a few.  First impressions... the doormen.  Just fabulous (Dani is one who was all smiles and courtesy all the time).  The concierge!  With people who have obtained clef d'or I learned the lengths they go to assist us.  Jose, Giovanni, and Raul among others.  We had waited for years to get an art piece and knew we wanted one from Spain for an empty wall.  They set us up with a gallery, but it was a bit more modern for my taste so they kept working and sent us to a different gallery where we bought 2 pieces!  They now hang on 2 different walls in our home.  Unfortunately, there was also a young gentleman who was working over the summer and he was such a delight, but I utterly forgot his name!  I'm so sorry.  He was a pleasure and we enjoyed talking to him each day.  He even wrote us a letter upon departure.  \n\nWe desperately hope to revisit one day and would stay nowhere but here.  Thank you !"

From the bell desk (Daniel is the go to man) to the concierge (Juan, Joel, Raul plus more) to Luisa the Guest Experience AM, the staff here go above and beyond. It has been an absolute pleasure to stay here. Highly highly recommended. We stayed here for our landmark wedding anniversary and everything FS Madrid did from Anniversary pillows, bubbly, personal gifts and touches and the bespoke Christmas dessert cannot be described in words. Branka the FB manager and the restaurant staff, so attentive, courteous and warm. Fabulous breakfast. The rooms are well appointed, plush and so private. Amenities and toiletries are fantastic (love the body wash). Set in an old bank and refurbished to the highest standard, this is the place to stay in Madrid. The location is in the heart of everything that is Madrid. So close to all the landmarks. Our stay here was quite magical. Well done FS Madrid!"

From the beginning we felt unwelcome:\n\n- They took a long time to serve us, we had to call someone to come and get us.\n- The waiter came and the first thing he asked us was the room number of the hotel, we told him we were not staying there and he quickly changed his attitude.\n- He brought us the American coffee and tea we had ordered. It was to be expected that because of the place (and the price, almost 30 euros) they would be served with the appropriate teapot and a pitcher of water for the Americano. But no, everything was served directly in the cups. By the way, the smallest American coffee I have ever had.\n- As soon as we finished our drinks, the waiter came over and asked us if he could take everything away, as if he was in a hurry for us to leave.\n\nSo that's what we did, we left with the idea of never going back to that place again. Such an attitude and service made us think that maybe the hotel cafeteria is only for guests, but then they should say so from the beginning.\n\nAn unfortunate experience in a hotel chain that is known for its elegance and kindness. Sincerely, anywhere in the world except except in Madrid."

Really! Put a canopy up there and some heaters and make it a useable space.\n\nThe record player and records to the room was a nice touch (upon request). However there is only one small table and one plug socket which meant there was no other space to put anything or charge items.\n\nThe fact that there is a bottle opener provided free in the room is standard, why then provide another with a Hardrock logo with a tag that says you can but it for 5 euros!!!! How many do you lose? Pointless exercise in my opinion.\n\nThis hotel was special occasion for my niece which failed to meet my expectations. If all Hardrock hotels are like this then I cant see them surviving. I doubt that I will visit any others based on this experience."

You queue up through the daily planet offices, arkham asylum all sorts.\n\nThe app is a bit temperamental and hard to translate to English but it's usable and gets you around.\n\nThe shows are pretty cool we saw the LAPD stunt show at the end of the day there's loads to choose from.\n\nMy only 2 issues were that due to the time of year there wasn't as many food and drink outlets/ restaurants open so the ones that were open had huge queues. Longer queueing for food than rollercoasters so we ate from wherever had no queues. Chocolate waffles and big bags of crisps. We wanted chicken but we'd have lost an hour getting lunch.\n\nAlso the merchandise could he better. We did manage to find some cool Parque Warner hoodies but it was all very Warner Bros generic and could have more Parque Warner memorabilia like water bottles/ tshirts/ mugs etc. branded with the rollercoasters or the park.\n\nOnly minor faults though. Me 40 two kids 8 and 9 both 135cm+ had a great day out.\n\nRecommend the coach and ticket combo from parque warner website if staying in the city."

Had some extra things on for Halloween but had to pay extra for some. Could buy fast track for rides but that was a fortune and i personally dont think its fair to do that. Food expensive and junk food, but can't take in your own. Long day for not going on many rides due to queues."

Two roller coasters broke down several times and one was even closed due to how many times it stopped working. All of these setbacks were announced only in spanish, we only had an idea from what was going on from the people waiting in line explaining it to us. There’s also rides which you have to pay additionally inside the park which is nonsense. I guess the sideshows made up the mess that this day was.\n\nThis park might be fun if you have small kids, but if you’re an adult and want to ride the hardcore stuff be ready to wait 2 hours in line and not be able to ride it at all.\n\nI can emphasise on a positive note how safe I felt on just the 2 rides that I was able to get on. The food was expensive but nothing out of this world. There’s a bus from Madrid centre until midnight but we just ended up leaving earlier. There are also a lot of vending/coffee machines located all over the park."

Load your card with 10 viajes (trips) for 6,10 Euros - it means every ride costs 0,61 Eur which is a bargain.\nThe card works on both, metro and bus and you can easily reload again.\nDownside is there's no time limit, so if you need to change metro/bus for one direction you must spend two trips from your card."

I was kept informed about the driver and pickup point for my transfer via WhatsApp, starting the day before my pickup and continuing until I connected with the driver at the Madrid airport. The driver, Carlos, was on time, holding a sign with my name. He confirmed my name and hotel destination, then took my bags and led me to the car which was just a short walk from the terminal. He didn’t speak English, but that wasn’t a problem at all. Carlos is an excellent driver. My hotel was in an awkward location in a square and cars can’t pull right up to the front. Carlos skillfully backed the car up through a small side street so he could get me as close to the hotel door as possible. He took my bags and led me to the hotel doorman. The service was wonderfully efficient. I had a few communications with them at the time of booking and their replies were prompt and thorough. I would definitely use this service again and recommend it to others."

The hotel’s impressive Ático and Terraza boast the best panoramic views of downtown Madrid. In both, amid large, lush garden areas, you can sip a cocktail or order from the menu concocted by Ramón Freixa (2 Michelin stars), soak up some sun in the Solarium or enjoy the sound of the overflow pool and the best ambient music or our outdoor showers in summer… and always with the finest service to ensure that your every wish is granted.",

                        "review_text": "This hotel has a big issue with the room temperature. They don’t allow you to change the temperature from the room, you have to call the front desk and then they call some other department. So each time you feel the temperature isn’t right, for example at 1:00 am when your small child is sleeping in the room, you have to make a phone call that may wake everyone up instead of using the thermostat on the wall. They do have one, but it’s fake. It doesn’t actually change the temperature. \n\nOn our first night here the room was almost 23 degrees. After thinking I could change it myself and it waiting a few hours wondering why it wouldn’t work, I called. They then lowered it. An hour later my room was 18 degrees and we were freezing. I called again and they explained they are the ones that can change it, not you in your own room where you’re sleeping. The man was very rude.By then it was already 11:00 pm and we couldn’t sleep due to the ridiculous temperatures. They said they would set it at 20. \n\nAnother hour goes by and the temperature is still 18.5 which is about 64 Fahrenheit. I call again, still unable to sleep and they say again they’re going to adjust it. Then a few minutes later someone knocks on my door, past midnight, asking if I called for an issue with the tv!!! Meanwhile the issue I did have wasn’t being resolved. \n\nI would caution guests to not stay here if they want to sleep at all. It has been an absolute nightmare.\n\nThe hotel is also mostly catering to people from outside so if you need a table at the rooftop or at the lobby restaurant you have absolutely no priority being a hotel guest. In fact if you are a guest waiting in the lobby for any reason, they will tell you very rudely to move because the tables are reserved for outsiders who have reservations and you can’t sit there to wait for your taxi even though they don’t have any other seating for their own guests.\n\nEvery single decent hotel I have stayed at gives its guests priority for all hotel amenities. This place has no idea what customer service means for a luxury hotel, which clearly they are not."

We stayed at the hotel for 5 days and on November 8th we left to Istanbul to spend several days there. The day after we arrived in Istanbul I realized that I left one of my Hermes bags in our room at the hotel. I was so disappointed but called the hotel and put the Massage for Guest service and unbelievably they answered me that they found my bag🥹. Also they told me that they can keep it for 2 months or arrange with a shipping company to send it to me. I’m a frequent traveler all over the world and absolutely It was one of my best experiences. One more time I want to thank Bless hotel management and staff, specifically dear Cristina and Lidia at Guest experience department."

There was no need to buy fast passes the park was busy but not too busy only one long queue the rest were ten minutes tops. Some were even walk ons.\n\nThe park is really clean and tidy and the themeing is really cool and there's so much and in so much detail for example in the queue for the Road Runner coaster there are loads of chalk board plans for how Wiley is going to catch Road Runner with boulders and stuff. You queue up through the daily planet offices, arkham asylum all sorts.\n\nThe app is a bit temperamental and hard to translate to English but it's usable and gets you around.\n\nThe shows are pretty cool we saw the LAPD stunt show at the end of the day there's loads to choose from.\n\nMy only 2 issues were that due to the time of year there wasn't as many food and drink outlets/ restaurants open so the ones that were open had huge queues. Longer queueing for food than rollercoasters so we ate from wherever had no queues. Chocolate waffles and big bags of crisps. We wanted chicken but we'd have lost an hour getting lunch.\n\nAlso the merchandise could he better. We did manage to find some cool Parque Warner hoodies but it was all very Warner Bros generic and could have more Parque Warner memorabilia like water bottles/ tshirts/ mugs etc. branded with the rollercoasters or the park.\n\nOnly minor faults though. Me 40 two kids 8 and 9 both 135cm+ had a great day out.\n\nRecommend the coach and ticket combo from parque warner website if staying in the city."

Two roller coasters broke down several times and one was even closed due to how many times it stopped working. All of these setbacks were announced only in spanish, we only had an idea from what was going on from the people waiting in line explaining it to us. There’s also rides which you have to pay additionally inside the park which is nonsense. I guess the sideshows made up the mess that this day was.\n\nThis park might be fun if you have small kids, but if you’re an adult and want to ride the hardcore stuff be ready to wait 2 hours in line and not be able to ride it at all.\n\nI can emphasise on a positive note how safe I felt on just the 2 rides that I was able to get on. The food was expensive but nothing out of this world. There’s a bus from Madrid centre until midnight but we just ended up leaving earlier. There are also a lot of vending/coffee machines located all over the park."

They enjoyed their life in the Lowcountry, crabbing, fishing, visiting the Limehouse Farmers Market on Wapoo road, and creating delicious home-cooked southern meals. They passed their recipes down to their granddaughter Tyler Kish, wife to Steve Kish chef/owner of 82 Queen. Florence and Jesse’s favorite dishes to cook were Deviled Crab Cakes, Seafood Gumbo, and Johnny Cakes.

Remember when FLK was the place to be, nestled in that charming strip mall at Windermere and Folly Road (near Osaka Japanese Restaurant)? With a hip menu, a crowd that looked like they stepped out of a magazine, and service that was as smooth as butter, dining there was always a delight.\n\nThen, just like that, they closed up shop. Cue the sad trombone.\n\nBut wait! They reopened, five miles down the road in what used to be a Mexican restaurant. We were thrilled, albeit a bit confused. We made the trek a few times, only to notice the vibe had shifted. Where did all the customers go? The food still held its own, but something felt... off.\n\nToday, we decided to give it another shot. We ordered the Lowcountry Shrimp Dip to share, and the Gumbo and Smashburger for mains.\n\n- The dip? Pretty tasty.\n- The burger and fries? Saltier than a sailor on shore leave.\n- And the gumbo? Oh boy, it was a culinary tragedy—a barely seasoned tomato soup with a sprinkle of Andouille sausage. We should've sent it back and demanded a redo!\n\nThe only reason we ever ventured this far down Folly Road was for Gillie's Seafood (now sadly closed) or Rita's in Folly Beach. At this rate, we can’t see ourselves making that trip again. It’s a shame to see\nFLK go downhill in our opinion."

We had the pulled pork and 1/2 order of a full chicken with a couple of sides. We split the meal with two drinks for a total cost of around $20.  It’s a walk up style ordering system when you go inside then they bring you the food. There is seating outside where we sat and enjoyed the music playing on the street. Food was excellent and the order takers at the counter are willing to explain their product to you. Our sides were mustard slaw and maple green beans. Great tasting"

Went thru the door at 8:37 pm to be told that they in fact do close at 9 pm, but they were already closed at the counter, but that we could order “back there” wherever that was. I am possibly assuming incorrectly that 306 BBQ updates their TripAdvisor entry since it clearly gave a 10pm closing time.  Regardless, we still arrived BEFORE the closing time on their door only to be basically turned away. Can’t give a review on the food since we didn’t get to try it, but the service - if you want to call it that - was useless. It should be against the law to turn customers away before closing time, especially at a fast food restaurant. I think the staff just didn’t want to work anymore. Y’all lost money tonight !! Hope it was worth it !!"

Everything else is just sad. It's a small crammy converted-looking space at one corner of the road. Here are a few things to know..\n\n- No lift! My room was on the first floor and the person at the reception had to lug the bag all the way up.\n- The staircase is super dingy, worn, and smelly.\n-  My room category: Junior Suite with Balcony\n  The \"suite\" is just a sizeable room with 3 beds (1 double + 2 single)\n- There's a small sitout-type area which looks at other surrounding buildings in your face - just a few meters away all of them!\n- The rooms are across from each other separated by a 2-3 feet hallway which means you're almost sleeping in a large dorm with paper-thin walls. Noise travels from all the rooms and even the reception if someone were to speak slightly loudly\n- Room phone doesn't work!\n- The doors of the rooms shut with a loud click and thud  - so each time anyone on the floor opened theirs, you feel someone's entering your room!\n- Breakfast was a tiny spread of stale breads, cakes, and fruits. So don't bother considering it free breakfast.\n- The Italian lady at the reception was quite friendly and helpful - but even she couldn't make up for the total scam of this \"3-star\" hotel!\n\nThere are plenty of hotels closer to the station on the same route as this hotel. I suggest dig a little deeper and find the right hotel for you. because, Luxor Florence is definitely not it!"

We reserved a standard king bed room and received a complimentary upgrade to a “nicer” king bed room. Nicer I guess because it was a corner room with a “better view” but not much else was different to the standard king bed room. \nThe common areas are beautifully decorated and well maintained. Front Desk staff were always informative and helpful. \nThe Executive Lounge, with indoor and outdoor seating, always had snacks, drinks, and small bites available throughout the day.\nWe had dinner in the restaurant there and it was just ok. Not bad but also not very good. The servers, though, were very attentive and friendly. \nWe did take advantage of the complimentary shuttle provided and were dropped off at the local train stop, just across the street from a mall. When we returned later that evening, I called the hotel to let them know we were back at the same drop-off location, but we still had to wait about 40 minutes for the driver to pick us up. Not a major inconvenience, until the rain started falling. Thankfully it was very light rain but there’s no place to seek shelter at that drop-off location. \nOverall, we enjoyed our stay in Florence but will definitely stay somewhere else if we do return. \n\nAs for the local train, it was very easy and inexpensive. About €1.70 per person each way, and it took us straight to the main station, Santa Maria Novella (S.M. Novella) where we enjoyed walking around, visiting the Duomo, and stopping for a most enjoyable lunch then gelato."

Restaurant and bar were lively and the Executive Lounge had great views of the Florence City Center.\n\nWould definitely recommend based on the affordability, comfort and value overall."

The lobby/bar/restaurant and second floor appear to have been recently refreshed but the guest rooms are pretty shabby by Hilton standards.  The poorly-designed nightstands are incredibly low relative to the bed, and they're glass.  An accident waiting to happen.  Mattress/bedding were good.  Room was furnished with a coffee maker, slippers, large soap/shampoo/lotion dispensers and the A/C was without issue in mild autumn weather.  I can't comment on the executive lounge, which looks really dated in the photos, because I was denied an upgrade despite availability.  This property gives little recognition to Hilton Honors members.  I was even hassled when getting bottled water, which is a benefit.  The front desk staff was consistently aloof in contrast to the friendly, earnest staff in the breakfast room.  The morning spread included an ample selection.  \n\nThe shuttle van was always at the ready and the trams were frequent so the distance wasn't a big inconvenience.  A taxi from SMN station at 10:30 pm was 19 euros on the meter but 28 after a surcharge was tacked on."

Asked hotel to book return taxis to wedding venue.  You don't seem to be able to book return journeys with any taxi companies. Shuttle service to tram very good...especially Samuel the driver...he was very helpful.  Hotel refused to order us a taxi from the tram after we missed the Shuttle bus one night.  Samuel told us the next day we could have got a bus. No one at the hotel mentioned this. We used Google maps to walk back, but would have been left stranded by the hotel reception if we were not able to walk. Not the best hotel...if you are visiting Florence stay in the city centre"

By giving us constant up and down looks.\nMind you that we were dressed very nice at least in our opinion and my spouse even had her Louis V bag, but that’s besides the point. \n\nWhen he asked I just said “somewhere” because we felt we were getting harrassed.

                        "review_text": "We divided our stay in Florence between the St Regis (for 4 nights ) and Four Seasons (5 nights ) so I will compare the two.\nLocation: The St Regis is an easier walk to shops and restaurants and is next to the Arno River. They do not provide any shuttle service to the historic center like the Four Season does. The Four Seasons has gorgeous, large peaceful gardens but the St Regis has no outdoor areas for relaxing.\n\nRooms: Although some of this is personal preference, we feel Four Seasons easily wins this category in terms of meticulous upkeep, outlets, bathroom design and ease of climate control. The St Regis was overall very well maintained but had more of an antique/grandma’s house feel with some sagging cushions, heavy dragging drapes, scuff marks on wood floor in our room and older- looking carpet and slight dings in hallways. We also preferred the overall ambiance of our Four Seasons room as it was lighter and brighter. Our St Regis room was large and very nice but had darker, bulkier furniture and heavy, very ornate closet doors. The St Regis had a slightly better shower stall size/ water pressure but Four Seasons had bigger/better towels. Both had very comfortable beds and pristine linens. The Four Seasons has electronic buttons for housekeeping and “do not disturb” but the St Regis has a paper sign you hang on the door.  It was more circuitous to get to our St Regis room and required  navigating some stairs, whereas, the Four Seasons was more convenient in this regard. However, this would likely depend on exact location of specific rooms. Both hotels have gorgeous impressive lobbies.\n\nService: The Four Seasons definitely wins this category . At the St Regis we were never offered any water by the doormen or generally were not asked by them if we needed help ( except  when we had suitcases). The Four Seasons doormen constantly asked us if we wanted water or needed assistance with anything. They were very proactive. One night we ordered soft drinks and appetizers in the St Regis restaurant bar area and actually felt ignored. We were never asked if we wanted any additional drinks, our dirty dishes were not removed, and we had to ask for the check. Service at breakfast each day was average. We felt servers performed their jobs on autopilot, whereas, the Four Seasons waiters were much more personable and service oriented. The St Regis did give us a bottle of Prosecco for our anniversary but no sweets or snacks to go with it like the Four Seasons did (plus other thoughtful surprises).  Also, while we noticed the St Regis staff had placed a stopper in our open Prosecco bottle in the room, they also had emptied the water in the bucket but never replaced the ice. Laundry service came back packaged more nicely at the Four Seasons (but it was also more expensive). These are nitpicking items but shows the difference in level of service. I will say the St Regis concierge and front desk staff were excellent when we had questions and that a maintenance issue we had at St Regis was also quickly rectified.\n\nFood: We felt St Regis was average for bar snacks and the breakfast buffet for a luxury hotel. Nothing wowed us. The cooked to order breakfast entrees were much better at the Four Seasons in our opinion and more authentic. Coffee/cappuchino was always served lukewarm at St Regis. Room service meals at Four Seasons were outstanding in terms of taste, presentation and service. We did not order any room service at St Regis. \n\nSummary: If we had not stayed at the Four Seasons Florence the first part of our vacation we probably would have thought the St Regis was wonderful. However, we kept comparing the two hotels and kept saying to ourselves that we wished we had stayed at the Four Seasons our entire trip. The Four Seasons had a higher price point but we felt it was worth every penny as it was truly flawless and kept exceeding our expectations. It may sound snobbish but our St Regis experience fell slightly below our expectations for a luxury hotel which is why I gave it four stars instead of five (I know, first world problem)."

In the room there is a minibar (for a fee) with water and alcoholic beverages. The rooms are simply but modernly furnished, with very good beds. The bathroom is large and has quality toiletries. The hotel has a breakfast room with quality dishes and with kind and nice young waitresses, ready to satisfy your every desire.\nIn conclusion, I RECOMMEND this beautiful, clean hotel with quality staff.\nPS.

Decor of the hotel was lovely. Lots of Italian charm. \n\nBreakfast was one of the best I’ve had from an Italian hotel. Service and food was fantastic. And overall service from the hotel was excellent, welcoming and helpful. \n\nWould highly recommend and would more than happily return, genuinely really impressed with our. (And all of the group felt the same!)"

Breakfast was very good, the room and view from the terrace was breathtaking. Definitely worth getting a room with a view. Staff confirmed rooms 1, 2, 3 & 4 had best views. Breakfast from 7:30. Ferries right outside the door. Top tip: Use the Ferry from the Targhetto landing, these are direct and around a 5 - 10 min walk from the hotel."

We really enjoyed the breakfast and especially the cappucinos! The hotel is a bit outside of the city center, which we found nice for things being quiet. It takes about 30-40 minutes to walk into the city center (but it is nice, right along the river) or there is a tram that takes you right near the train station.  They also organized a wine tour for us which was great. Would definitely stay again and recommend!"

You can also use this building during the day as a place to relax/read. It is a short 10-15 minute walk along the river, into the centre of Florence.

He pointed things out and had such great stories that only come from years of experience and  knowledge ..his  delivery made it such a wonderful experience.  He made everything so easy ..setting up the tour,\nGetting tickets and sharing things that would be near impossibly  to do on your own.\nI highly recommending you spend as much time as possible with him And guarantee you won’t be disappointed.\n We spent seventeen days in Italy and this was the most memorable hour of the trip.

What would have taken hours to research she was able to explain, and even interlink the people and places of Florence’s history. No wait tickets into all the exhibits. This city requires a lot of walking, but there were plenty times for breaks. This private tour was worth every cent."

WE arrived on Monday late afternoon, and were so glad to be able to get oriented around Florence and save our energy and attention for Wednesday morning for an amazing tour of important works and collections at the Uffizi Gallery and the Accademia Gallery. What we hadn't known was that we would have such an amazing Tour Guide in Silvia! What a true treat and gift to meet her in front of the Cafe Rivoire in Piazza della Signoria at 10am! We only just met her and her effervenscent self which shone throughout the tour in addition to the pride she exuded telling us of these important works and history as it formed Florentine and Italian culture. A true and proud born and raised Florentine herself, she is steeped in local and ancient lore that she was generous in sharing with us.\n\nWe had not yet had breakfast since we walked so much the day before, and slept in longer than we anticipated before the morning of the tour. But, Silvia was absoloutely charming, warm and friendly and even concerned we hadn't yet had breakfast, so we stopped first to enjoy our cappucino and steamed milk tea while she spoke about what we were to accomplish in the Private Tour. We could do as much or as little, and customize the tour as we needed as it was just for Us Two. We enjoyed our morning hot drinks while we listened just outside the Uffizi Gallery entrance as Siliva recounted the deep history of the Medici and the impact they had on artwork of the Renaissance and life during these ancient times, including natural science, medicine and intellectual thought.\n\nWe were to embark on seeing highlights of both galleries, and there is so much to see! We are blessed to have been able to have a Private Tour, and not be on a large tour with a guide and a speaker/headphone set. We really got to hear and enjoyed having Silvia's extensive and amazing expertise and guidance sharing the stories around all the works we saw.\n\nWe would also get to admire the 17-foot scultpture of David by Michelangel and enjoyed exclusive entrance and passage in to both places. But, first, we needed a quick lunch and we sat and chatted in a small cafe off the Arno with the most amazing panini and juices before leaving for The David!\n\nThe care, depth of knowledge and extensive hospitality Silvia shared with us unmatched, and definitely was a highlight of our Florence Trip! Thank you again, and we will surely recommend Silvia and LivTours to others and share our positive experience with our agent, Human X Nature Travel!"

The tour we too (family of 6 adults) was my second time. My husband and I heard her on Rick Steve's podcast and booked it when we visited Florence last year (2023) and it was the first thing we booked for our family trip with our kids in 2024!

I mentioned that the breakfast was nearly empty of everything two mornings in a row at 9 AM. The last day there the only thing they had was gravy. I'm not exaggerating. He assured me Miss Arlene wants to take kitchen and we will be very impressed. When we showed up for breakfast, Miss Arlene was busy as a bee, keeping everything clean and stocked and perfect. She's such a sweet, wonderful lady and both of Tim and Arlene have the sweetest most excepting loving Attitudes personalities off the top of the chains. Tim and Arlene are absolutely assets to your Hampton Inn franchise. We thoroughly loved getting to know them and eating this delicious breakfast."

They enjoyed their life in the Lowcountry, crabbing, fishing, visiting the Limehouse Farmers Market on Wapoo road, and creating delicious home-cooked southern meals. They passed their recipes down to their granddaughter Tyler Kish, wife to Steve Kish chef/owner of 82 Queen. Florence and Jesse’s favorite dishes to cook were Deviled Crab Cakes, Seafood Gumbo, and Johnny Cakes.

Remember when FLK was the place to be, nestled in that charming strip mall at Windermere and Folly Road (near Osaka Japanese Restaurant)? With a hip menu, a crowd that looked like they stepped out of a magazine, and service that was as smooth as butter, dining there was always a delight.\n\nThen, just like that, they closed up shop. Cue the sad trombone.\n\nBut wait! They reopened, five miles down the road in what used to be a Mexican restaurant. We were thrilled, albeit a bit confused. We made the trek a few times, only to notice the vibe had shifted. Where did all the customers go? The food still held its own, but something felt... off.\n\nToday, we decided to give it another shot. We ordered the Lowcountry Shrimp Dip to share, and the Gumbo and Smashburger for mains.\n\n- The dip? Pretty tasty.\n- The burger and fries? Saltier than a sailor on shore leave.\n- And the gumbo? Oh boy, it was a culinary tragedy—a barely seasoned tomato soup with a sprinkle of Andouille sausage. We should've sent it back and demanded a redo!\n\nThe only reason we ever ventured this far down Folly Road was for Gillie's Seafood (now sadly closed) or Rita's in Folly Beach. At this rate, we can’t see ourselves making that trip again. It’s a shame to see\nFLK go downhill in our opinion."

My room was on the first floor and the person at the reception had to lug the bag all the way up.\n- The staircase is super dingy, worn, and smelly.\n-  My room category: Junior Suite with Balcony\n  The \"suite\" is just a sizeable room with 3 beds (1 double + 2 single)\n- There's a small sitout-type area which looks at other surrounding buildings in your face - just a few meters away all of them!\n- The rooms are across from each other separated by a 2-3 feet hallway which means you're almost sleeping in a large dorm with paper-thin walls. Noise travels from all the rooms and even the reception if someone were to speak slightly loudly\n- Room phone doesn't work!\n- The doors of the rooms shut with a loud click and thud  - so each time anyone on the floor opened theirs, you feel someone's entering your room!\n- Breakfast was a tiny spread of stale breads, cakes, and fruits. So don't bother considering it free breakfast.\n- The Italian lady at the reception was quite friendly and helpful - but even she couldn't make up for the total scam of this \"3-star\" hotel!\n\nThere are plenty of hotels closer to the station on the same route as this hotel. I suggest dig a little deeper and find the right hotel for you. because, Luxor Florence is definitely not it!"

There are different options for lunch and the most economical option is 1580yen per person and up to 4080yeb per person for 60 minutes.  It wasn’t too busy when we were here so we sat over 60 mins and it was still ok but we were so full already.  Soup base options are quite common and I would say you need dipping sauce to go with it for sure as I find it a bit bland.  They even have curry sauce as well which you can have it with rice, noodles etc.  ice cream is also free here.  overall experience I would say it’s good for value and good if it’s not busy.  This time i didn’t try domestic beef which I should have ordered since I was too rush to order.  Enjoy!"

They advertise themselves as a proper Kobe restaurant, supervised by a Michelin 3-star trained chef, serving halal Kobe - however I doubt that what they served us was actually Kobe beef. They make you pay in advance. Most of the kobe beef items are only available in set menus and the price isn't cheap. The starters etc were fine (nothing to write home about), but when the steak came out, our mood instantly soured. The meat was tough and had 0 marbling. It tasted like a average/disappointing steak you'd get from a mediocre restaurant anywhere - definitely not tender or melting, and had no special flavour. When we asked the staff why the meat had no marbling and was not tender like wagyu we've had elsewhere, their response was that the meat they source is the \"lean cuts\" of Kobe, and they cook it medium rare to keep it tender. I'm not sure that's even true (I've not heard of lean cuts of Kobe which has no fat marbling through it), and they did not explain that ANYWHERE on their website or online. Only when we asked about the steak did they point to a page on the menu which stated the above. That's when we felt that this place is a scam taking advantage of excited Muslims eager to try halal Kobe close to its source. Outrageous. We paid around $190 AUD for tough, disappointing tasting steak and some soup, salad and dessert. Oh and the dessert we got was store bought ice cream out of a tub - we couldn't even order the custard pudding because it had alcohol on it. Why make one of your set menu dessert options non-halal when you are obviously catering to muslim customers? I could have gotten a better dessert from a 7-eleven. It was insulting. Please be warned. Do not go to this place. \nWe were severely mislead ny the good reviews on TripAdvisor and Google- the restaurant must have a system to entice customers to leave good reviews in exchange for something."

We paid ~19000 yen ($190) each for the Kobe set menu but was extremely disappointed by what was served for this price point. Additionally, the dessert options are NOT halal friendly so this was further disappointing. All in all, this appears to be a trap set up by the operator to take advantage of tourists looking to experience Kobe beef. Having read the negative reviews after this experience, it is clear that there is a system set up by the owner to get people to positively review the restaurant using free drink upon reviews being placed. I firmly believe that this steak is NOT Kobe Beef as it tastes like a regular steak, the was zero marbling (see pic) and we were not shown any certification (instead lied to). I will look to share this review on other platforms and will take steps to communicate this feedback to relevant tourism authorities."

While the food was good there were definitely elements of the service that left us disappointed. First, they have you order off a QR code which is not a great experience for a top quality restaurant, the waiter just dropped off the code and basically said good luck. He did not explain how to order, how much to order, anything about the different cuts, or ultimately when the meat came how to cook it. While the meat was delicious the experience would have been much better if they had taken the time to give us explanations and guided us through the ordering not just telling us to do it on our phone and good luck. For our most expensive meal in Japan I would have expected more. Not a bad option to try upscale wagyu but I’m sure if you search a little further Kyoto has something more to offer."

Our COVID passports weren’t working for some reason so he gave myself and my friends tests to do so we could still eat. \nArriving quite late, around 9:30pm.. we were sat, and had food in front of us within 20 minutes and we ordered ALOT of food. I absolutely love sushi and have eaten it so much in my life and this restaurant, for a last minute walk in and ordering, was absolutely brilliant. The sushi was delicious (especially the salmon sashimi - beautifully thick fresh pieces) the chefs behind the counter outdid themselves. \nPrompt service, lovely staff (specially Rafael) and most importantly, deliciously fresh food. I’d recommended booking a table and experiencing it. \n\nThanks very much Kyoto, I’ll definitely be back."

And simply: It was terrible. The meat was filled with tendons and it was impossible to chew. In particular the Nanzan loin was terrible.\nWhen complaining the staff just smiled and pretended not to understand what was the problem. When we asked to talk to a Manager he just smiled and took no further notice!\nThere were many japanese guests (locals I think) so unfortunately we left with a feeling that the tourist visitors are served what's left.

We called the waitress over to explain that we were given the wrong menu, and we have dietary restrictions. There was no way to have a conversation as no one in the whole restaurant spoke English! It took so long to process anything or get through to them. We ended up spending most of the time trying to get the staff to understand us using translation apps.\nBut nothing seemed to work, we were met with blank stares mostly.\n\nAn apologetic waitress offered us cake free of charge, but when the bill came they insisted on us paying for it.\nThey actually tried to bill us the full amount, even though we were only served two small dishes. \n\nA complete mess, no service mentality, menus not matching, and at no time did anyone try to remedy the situation.\n\nThey had no regard for our time:  we were stuck arguing the bill even though we had  told them that we had to leave at a certain time as we had theater tickets and arrived late to the venue and were nearly not allowed entry. \nThis whole experience really ruined our special day!"

Situated in a 1927 historical building across the street from the Okura Hotel. it has a bamboo garden in the back with tables that face the beautiful view. Now, the food and drinks are the real problem here. The restaurant is supposed to be a French bistro, and I don’t think because you serve French food, your portions need to be minuscule. Let’s start with the drinks. A gin and tonic served in a small 6-8 ounce glass and a sangria served chilled and in a portion similar to a wine portion. Need to remind that sangria is a mix of red wine and juices, and normally served as a full glass. This was a 2 finger portion in a large wine glass. The food.  We started with French onion soup which was served in a tiny, toy set bowl, probably no bigger than 2-3 ounces of soup.  It tasted good, but leaves you wishing for more, a lot more. Then a portion of mussels, very small again, with not a lot of flavor. A red wine braised beef served as two small pieces on no kore than a spoon of mashed potatoes. Half of the meat was fat, which was inedible. We asked for bread at ¥700 and a slice of bread cut in half was brought to us. The deserts were ok, but nothing worth telling. Total bill ¥11,000. We are ready to go for seconds somewhere else…"

It is also very close to the resturants, food areas, subway and bus lines, making it an excellent spot for tourists."

The quality of the buildout was exceptional, polar opposite of the generic 4 seasons Mexico City.  We loved the cream brûlée pancakes. Hôtel is much smaller than it looks like in the photos, which we liked.  Sad the geisha never showed up in time on Saturday night for the show.  Japanese exceptionalism and quality at its best.

I had to find someone to take my order a few times. I’ve had much better breakfast in other comparably priced hotels in Japan. That said, the Japanese breakfast is exquisite.\n\nCocktail lounge was okay but not as good as other five star hotels in Japan.\n\nGeiko/geisha experience was amazing and best part of stay. This is probably the reason to stay here above the other top tier hotels in Kyoto if you really want to see up close what that is like. The concierge was very helpful arranging all of these experiences and restaurant bookings."

I am French myself, and we have never visited the Four Seasons Kyoto, while based in Osaka, we patronize a lot the local Four Seasons, where dining excels, we love the quality restaurant Est in Tokyo as well, and so on traveling from Osaka just for a treat, \nWe, the couple, decided that day to do a visit around 3 pm, knowing the general manager is French Mrs. Fa. Gu..... we sought to have a little bite a treat in the lower lobby, having a glass of red wine glass served the  Cht Valandraud and cheese platers, a noisy saxophone disturbed us while enjoying the lovely garden view in front of us, and after a while, I asked the sommelier to share my name card to the management office to meet someone, the sommelier confirmed me twice he did. I have been in the hotel world my whole life, knowing most of the key managers around Japan are all close to customers I was not going to complain, but I was planning to share our experience with the upper management of our journey at  Kyotto Four Seasons we have been thrilled to have such great service by this Thai colleague who was cheerful, kind, attentive, and the cheese platers for a Japanese standard was amazing with quality bread and butter with some ash on it another new item we did enjoy.\nWe did enjoy the traditional dance in the lobby, too. I have been living in Japan for a while and enjoyed myself, but it is not this noisy, it is far too noisy. The saxophone was not in the right place in the main lobby, and the sound was not balanced at all.\n Past six pm, nobody came to visit us, no duty manager or guest relations nor the hotel or food beverage manager, leadership has been busy with meetings probably.\nWell, of course, we could not congratulate the team for such lovely momentum, but I highly recommend the lower lobby and the garden any time.\n Communication and customer relations in such a luxury environment are basic and common. Don't expect any contact after 6 pm in this part of Kyoto, next time, we will go to the Amman hotel; it is just sad."

Too much money paid (roughly £200 per night per room) for the standard. This price was not including breakfast."

It is above the Porto shopping centre which offers lots of choice for dining if you want to stay local. Room had a great view of the Kyoto Tower and the bed and linen are comfy and crisp. The reason for 3 star review is that the hotel is very busy, it feels very suited to a conference location or property for larger tour groups. This impacts on the customer service, all staff were very polite and professional but they are dealing with you from an efficiency perspective rather than one of real interest. An example is that on check in you are given breakfast vouchers which you present in the dining room, made it feel like a canteen experience. Breakfast very busy and not a relaxing or enjoyable event. So if you are looking for a more personal welcome, check out other options."

Most mod-cons are included but there were no USB sockets in the room and an iron/ironing board is only available on request.\n\nThe main downside to staying at this hotel is the ridiculous policy of charging guests an extra 3,300 Yen per day to use the gym and/or pool!! \n\nOn the plus side, the excellent concierge was a great help with restaurant recommendations and reservations (which can be difficult as a tourist). They also operate a free shuttle service to Kyoto train station every 30mins which is very useful (both pick-up and drop-off). \n\nBreakfast is either a traditional Japanese breakfast on the 6th floor which is definitely recommended at least doing once. There's also a buffet breakfast on the 17th floor which was reasonable and included cooked-to-order eggs. However, the fruit was extremely limited and mostly of the tinned variety. \n\nOverall, the hotel provides good base for exploring wonderful Kyoto, but if you want to use a gym and/or pool you might find better value by looking elsewhere."

Our expectations were once again exceeded.\n\nThe staff at this hotel -- front desk, concierge, housekeeping and food and beverage--consistently go out of their way to make us feel welcome and truly appreciated. Dennis in the concierge's office was particularly warm and helpful.\n\nWhile the \"soft\" product here is impressive, the \"hard\" product also met all our needs. The room, a decent size by Japanese hotel standards, was well-designed with plenty of electrical outlets for our devices (something lacking in many hotels). The bath/shower was divine.\n\nWe loved the Touzan Bar, which has some sophisticated bartenders, Sette restaurant and the Cafe 33 (though we missed the okonamayaki that was on the menu on previous visits).\n\nWe'll always return to this hotel."

The price extremely high for what is offered.   We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Kyoto as well.  Our opinion was that Hyatt Regency is much better in service and rooms.  Cost benefit ratio significantly better than Park Hyatt.   The only positive for park H is the location if you want to access Kiyomizu temple area.   On the other hand if you want to access Sanjyusangendo, Hyatt Regency is next door."

                        "review_text": "This hotel was absolutely amazing, and surpassed all of our expectations - I would highly recommend booking this hotel if you can find availability!\n\nWe stayed in a City Deluxe Room and were blown away by the attention to detail in the room design, the comfort, and functionality. The hotel opened recently, and everything felt new and custom. This room felt luxe, bespoke and truly designed for Kyoto. The room design was a perfect mix of Western and Japanese design and sensibilities, with an incredibly comfortable bed and pillows, a spectacular bathroom area, and a beautiful sitting area - and custom touches throughout. The design of the room and the hotel are so cohesive and thoughtful, it was a joy to get back to our room each day after the long, tiring days sightseeing in Kyoto!\n\nThe hotel itself really impressed us - it is truly a boutique hotel, with less than 20 rooms. I'll admit, I was a little nervous as I'd never stayed at a hotel this small before, but this hotel really surpassed expectations with it's personal service level, its location tucked into a local neighborhood along the riverfront, and just cozy and chic \"vibes\". All of the staff were helpful and so knowledgeable, with excellent recommendations for nearby restaurants and things to do. The lobby restaurant / bar are great for either the breakfast or an evening cocktail (I loved the Kyoto Negroni). And there's a beautiful garden rooftop with views of the city over the river, which was great in good weather. \n\nThe neighborhood was also great - quiet, away from the crowds, and in a very local, neighborhood area - but still really easy to get to transit options, and walkable to either Gion or Kyoto station area. In fact, we walked here from Kyoto station with our luggage in about 15 minutes. Also, the hotel staff have great recommendations for nearby food and drink options. The hotel is right on the river, too!\n\nI can't say enough about how much we loved this hotel, and I would recommend staying here, and hope to get to return someday! It definitely is one of the most memorable hotels I've stayed at, for all the right reasons!"

Even though its architecture is contemporary, it has design details that reference traditional features and techniques. Their Japanese garden in the lobby has a back wall that looks like wood, but is actually concrete with imprinted wood patterns.  It was so cool! Our room was spacious with very comfortable beds, and the view was just amazing.  Looking at the birds and fish and turtles on the river was really fun and calming.  But the best part was getting to know the wonderful staff. They all speak English well and are incredibly friendly and helpful. We are grateful to them for a most memorable trip."

Not only were the rooms super clean and comfortable as ever, but they have been enhanced with more charming details.  Our breakfast and meals were delicious and beautifully presented.  The staff recognized us, and were helpful, efficient and friendly in a way that you feel is coming from their hearts. They looked after us in every way, showing us the bus and train stations and providing suggestions for restaurants and activities.  I totally recommend this hotel to anyone who appreciates good design and good people, not to mention beautiful gardens, free bicycles and free self-service laundry.  This is surely our home away from home in Kyoto!"

As you walk in, you enter the lobby area that is combined with a small restaurant where you can eat breakfast in the morning. There is a little zen garden to the right, perfect for sitting and having a cup of coffee. On the top floor, there is a garden where you can either have breakfast (make sure to make a reservation!) or have a glass of wine!\n\nWe only spent one night and they had thoughtfully upgraded our room to one that overlooks the river. The room was incredibly spacious, with a gigantic bed, an eating area with a tatami mat, a small bench and table, where you can either read or work, and a shower/tub room that felt like a spa, separate from the water closet. It was so relaxing to sit on the balcony and watch the herons and turtles below.\n\nThe neighborhood is walkable to Nishiki market and the shopping area immediately surrounding it but it is definitely a good 20 minute walk or so. After we checked into the hotel and stashed our belongings, it was a bit too late for us to easily find lunch close to the hotel, and we ended up having to walk for a bit to find something to eat. We are definitely planning on staying here again when we are back in Kyoto!"

Make sure you stop by the Daikaiden-Giant Grand Staircase from 5p.m. - 10p.m. each day on as the staircase is lit up from the 3rd floor to the 8th floor with colorful flashing LED lights of different themes depending on the month and season as the images are depicted accordingly.  During our visit in July, the theme was \"Summer- Gion Festival Lights.\" It was very colorful and many different scenes change and move around the staircase itself that acts as a background screen. \nThere are no seats so make yourself comfortable by locating a good spot to view the lighted staircase.  Also, there are people who sit and/or run up and down the staircase, so it may obstruct your view or while you are taking photos as it is a working staircase.  Definitely worth a stop for a short break over to view it if you are in the Kyoto Station after sunset."

Even though there are 4 Starbucks inside the station, we crossed the road to sit outside and watch the world.  I recognised the frontage from other trip advisor posts, and decided to kill the hour we had, exploring inside.  Omg.  I have never seen such steep escalators, rooftop gardens and free views! The enclosed walkway, the lit up stairs. Some nice seating too.  The top floor has a high end restaurant area with many restaurants.  Another end has a Ramen street!  It’s like 400m long!  Not including the many shops and department store!  There’s a hotel and a cinema…. So much!"

We visited in 2018 at the suggestion of friends and were skeptical at first but were very impressive with the train station. There are lots of architectural features to it that make it interesting including the Happy Terrace with unobstructed views of the surrounding city, the Skyway which goes high above the station, the grand staircase, and the large openings to see whats around like the Kyoto Tower.\n\nOur favourite spot is the ramen street on the tenth floor which features award winning ramen from all over Japan. You do have to queue and prepay using vending machines at most (if not all) restaurants but it is worth the wait if you have time for lunch or dinner in the Kyoto Station area.\n\nThere are also numerous shops and conveniences that you would expect for a large train station in Japan and it is relatively easy to navigate. If you are a stamp collector like my wife you can go to the information centre or ask a station attendant for information on where to get your stamp.\n\nWe spent a couple of hours at the train station and would recommend getting here before your train departs to check it out or planning for a lunch or dinner here after your train arrives. When we stayed in Kyoto we found that the Kyoto Station was central to all the activities we wanted to do in Kyoto and offered us easy and frequent transit solutions to get to what we wanted to see."

Their hospitality skills are superb. You could be staying in tents and they would still make it OK.  They are charming, helpful and genuinely friendly. As a previous reviewer from Australia said, you would happily welcome them into your own house if they were ever to visit you. \nThey set the same high standards for their young staff who as a result  are also charming,helpful and friendly.\n\nFor many years now I have been lucky to travel extensively both for work and pleasure.  Sometimes I  have stayed in expensive, luxurious establishments and sometimes in comfortable but more affordable places like Mume.  Some of them have even been excellent but Mume is still the most enjoyable hotel I have ever stayed in and superb value for money in Kyoto."

The hotel is very modern and well run with efficent and polite staff, all whom spoke quite good English.\n\nThe rooms were very tidy and even though it is in a major part of Kytoto is was very quiet apart from some party goers once outside on the orad on Sunday night.\n\nThe breakfast offers a huge range of food, both western and eatern inspired and the huge rooms you eat in were very comfortable with nice large cocuhes and artworks on the walls.\n\nThe beds and pillows were the usual firm sort you get in Japan, which I actually prefer to overly soft.\n\nThe location is excellent, a block away from the river, which has plenty of great walks around Gion and the old geiko areas. It is also very close to the resturants, food areas, subway and bus lines, making it an excellent spot for tourists."

The location is excellent, just off a main street, Kawaramachi, with several bus lines as well as the subway a few blocks away. The staff are all exceedingly polite and helpful.

The separate WC, vanity, and wet room were great. There was plenty of room in both the entrance hall and the closet for our carry-on luggage. The mattress and pillows were just right, and we slept well with the black-out shades. We did not dine at the onsite restaurant.

Save on your luggage space!

That said, the Japanese breakfast is exquisite.\n\nCocktail lounge was okay but not as good as other five star hotels in Japan.\n\nGeiko/geisha experience was amazing and best part of stay. This is probably the reason to stay here above the other top tier hotels in Kyoto if you really want to see up close what that is like.

I am French myself, and we have never visited the Four Seasons Kyoto, while based in Osaka, we patronize a lot the local Four Seasons, where dining excels, we love the quality restaurant Est in Tokyo as well, and so on traveling from Osaka just for a treat, \nWe, the couple, decided that day to do a visit around 3 pm, knowing the general manager is French Mrs. Fa. Gu..... we sought to have a little bite a treat in the lower lobby, having a glass of red wine glass served the  Cht Valandraud and cheese platers, a noisy saxophone disturbed us while enjoying the lovely garden view in front of us, and after a while, I asked the sommelier to share my name card to the management office to meet someone, the sommelier confirmed me twice he did. I have been in the hotel world my whole life, knowing most of the key managers around Japan are all close to customers I was not going to complain, but I was planning to share our experience with the upper management of our journey at  Kyotto Four Seasons we have been thrilled to have such great service by this Thai colleague who was cheerful, kind, attentive, and the cheese platers for a Japanese standard was amazing with quality bread and butter with some ash on it another new item we did enjoy.\nWe did enjoy the traditional dance in the lobby, too. I have been living in Japan for a while and enjoyed myself, but it is not this noisy, it is far too noisy. The saxophone was not in the right place in the main lobby, and the sound was not balanced at all.\n Past six pm, nobody came to visit us, no duty manager or guest relations nor the hotel or food beverage manager, leadership has been busy with meetings probably.\nWell, of course, we could not congratulate the team for such lovely momentum, but I highly recommend the lower lobby and the garden any time.\n Communication and customer relations in such a luxury environment are basic and common. Don't expect any contact after 6 pm in this part of Kyoto, next time, we will go to the Amman hotel; it is just sad."

The reason for 3 star review is that the hotel is very busy, it feels very suited to a conference location or property for larger tour groups. This impacts on the customer service, all staff were very polite and professional but they are dealing with you from an efficiency perspective rather than one of real interest. An example is that on check in you are given breakfast vouchers which you present in the dining room, made it feel like a canteen experience. Breakfast very busy and not a relaxing or enjoyable event. So if you are looking for a more personal welcome, check out other options."

No visitor to Istanbul be it Greta Garbo, Agatha Christie or the King of Spain would leave the city without paying a call. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the Turkish president was a loyal client. Emigrés and civil servants, bohemians and politicians all rubbed shoulders in its wood-paneled dining-room. The common denominator was a sophisticated ambiance, Central & Eastern European delicacies and lashings of ice-cold lemon vodka and some spectacular cocktails. This Istanbul institution with its 98 years tradition is in every detail a legend of a restaurant and bar in istanbul.",

Time. One can just imagine Trotsky sitting at the bar and Ataturk at his (permanently „reserved“) table in the corner.\nThe staff are very attentive and friendly and service was fast and reliable.\nThe food was delicious and the drinks fantastic. There is a rather extensive selection of well known, mainly European, dishes.\nThe bar is well equipped and I recommend trying one or two of the delicious cocktails or the vodka tray (if you dare)"

                        "review_text": "1924Istanbul was the great discovery of our Istanbul trip. The decor is luxurious, but with a strong hint of decadence, reminiscent of the restaurant's beginnings as a retreat for Russians escaping the revolution. The feeling that 'anything could happen' - that delicious sense of possibility, fun, and adventure - so lacking in a world filled with generic 'sports' bars and sterile pubs - lives in the candlelit shadows of 1924Istanbul. The owner, Sasha, is a world class host—befriending us after our second visit, introducing us to the glories of the infused vodka cart, wheeled around the restaurant by a waiter in evening clothes. Sasha's nightlife pedigree includes the legendary 80s New York City after-hours club, 'Save the Robots'—one of the greats. That feeling is very much present at 1924Istanbul. Sasha absolutely gets it. The food, high end Russian emigre fare, is terrific. The booze is great. The service is top notch. (On our second visit, they'd run out of the local beer that I loved, but our bartender, a wonderful host in his own right, made a point to run out and get more for me. Perfect!) The music, an older gentleman on accordion playing 'Lily Marlene' and 'La vie en Rose' and then sitting at the upright piano for more of the same, adds a touch of romantic melancholy to the evening. If you ever fantasized about drinking in 20s Paris or Berlin, or at Rick's Cantina in 'Casablanca' (I do!) then you will LOVE 1924Istanbul. It's easily one of my favorite drinking experiences in the world. Get thee to 1924Istanbul. You're welcome!"

The food was generally salty, they didn’t use EVOO, which was expected from a restaurant influenced by Greek Cuisine. At least the name of the restaurant is a Greek island. It was so hot. They need to use some fans here in there. They gave me a piece of calamari slice I mean, literally a ring of a calamari as an appetizer. I thought this was for tasting, but it was the literally whole thing. The other food was very small portions. Also, yes I’m not expecting American portions, but these are really small for the amount of the people. We were total of nine adults and one kid first they charge me around 12,000 lira when I was leaving the place they caught me at the exit and they told me they charged wrong tables bill and they required another 8800 lira with the tips and total of payment I paid 20,200 liras.(640$ currency of the day) We used one bottle of Raki and standard menu, which was tiny, a little sardines wrapped in leaves, which was quite salty also. With the amount of people The atmosphere has been given, and the food does not worth that money. Also I paid in CASH and they did not give me a RECEIPT at all not at first time nor not at the second time so this makes me think this place is acting questionable with the tax situation. to be honest, I won’t go there one more time. If you are willing to go, please figure out the costs before you order anything please ask for a receipt."

Our waiter was not friendly and scoffed when I requested to taste a wine before ordering it (in California, one of the best wine regions in the world, they welcome tastings). We ordered tuna tartare, hamachi, soft shell crab and sea bass, all of it was mediocre at best. Worst of all we left having spent over $200 for one of the worst fine dining experiences of our lives. And btw, the promise of a DJ spinning tunes under the stars never happened - and this was a Saturday night!"

What a mistake that turned out to be.\n\nI have never seen such poor service ever (McDonald’s service in a Micheline star restaurant).  Despite having a reservation and wanting to enjoy a nice dining experience, they were continuously rushing us to place our order.\n\nThe dishes, when they eventually came, were simply whatever random number of dishes they decided themselves. The gave us three dishes of something when we had only ordered one.\n\n \n\nWe were asked by the waiter if he had to serve us or if we could do it ourselves. We politely asked for them to serve us, which they did not like. They eventually did reluctantly serve us but with a rude attitude.  As soon as one person was done eating, they immediately removed their plate and provided the dessert menu and plate on the table. When asked for them to slow down, letting them know that others at the table  were still eating, we were completely ignored and they kept on doing the same thing.\n\nWhen we told them again repeatedly to slow down, they said that their kitchen was closing soon when other tables still eating and ordering.\n\nBy this time, we really had lost our patience and decided to leave without dessert and proceeded to order the check.  Well, we were in for another major surprise. Of course, they charged us for all those additional dishes we did not order.\n\nThe total bill came to 694 EUR. To add insult to injury, they included a service charge of 90 EUR when similar, in fact better restaurants, only added a service charge of 20 EUR.  They wanted us to pay in EUR but when we looked at the exchange rate there was an extra 50 EUR in their favor compared to the official exchange rate. A manager eventually came to the table at our request who applied  the official exchange rate and removed the previously applied 50 EUR “incorrectly applied” exchange rate.   \n\nNow comes payment time and we tried to pay with 3 Revolut cards. To our surprise none of them worked when they had worked perfectly fine everywhere else. Of course, not in this restaurant as they wanted us to pay in cash and in Euros. We ended up paying cash and leaving with a very bitter taste in our mouths.\n\nI would not recommend this restaurant to anyone!  The food is ok, but not to a Micheline standard.  The restaurant has a pleasant view but a lot of restaurants in Istanbul do too, which provide a much more pleasant dining experience for less money."

They charged 300+ EUR per pax for dinner and they had no transparency on the breakdown of the prices. We went on 31-Dec early afternoon to make the booking and they asked us to pay a deposit in cash, we told them we didn’t have any cash so they told us to make the entire payment upfront. They even promised us they have seats with good view of the bridge reserved for us. When we reached, they had changed the table next to a pillar which blocked our view to the bridge. Food was just really blend and average. Their serving method was very chaotic and when we asked for olive oil for the bread, despite reminding them twice they never brought it to us till the end. They had a staff member at the entrance gathering our coats and when we left the restaurant he asked for 200 Lira and his mouth smelled really and of alcohol. When we were on deserts, me and my friend stepped out for a smoke and without asking us they had cleared our plates. When we asked for itemized bill they purposely pretended to not understand our request and kept saying that we have to pay 10% service charge extra in cash due to accounting reasons. Huge red flag! When they brought the itemized bill, they categorised 400+ eur just for “New year’s drink”, I don’t even drink and initially when paying for dinner I had asked this question but they just deflected my question. Huge huge SCAM! And worse of all they have used Michelin stickers everywhere to deceive everyone. Please save your hard earned money and don’t go here!!!"

I was surprised and somewhat disappointed to see other guests dressed in casual attire, including shorts and baseball caps. When I complained about this to the manager his response was their dress code is smart casual and that they accept people wearing shorts and baseball caps. While I understand that dress codes can vary, I believe that a restaurant of this caliber would benefit from maintaining a certain level of decorum in terms of dress.    It would greatly enhance the overall atmosphere and ensure that all guests can fully appreciate the refined setting. I felt I was dining at McDonalds when sitting next to these people.\n I hope that the management will consider implementing or reinforcing a dress code to preserve the elegant environment that they have worked so hard to create."

Ever since then, it has been the top-rated restaurant in Arlington every time I check. Recently, I had the opportunity to take my lovely bride back there a second time. They did not let me down. It is every bit as good as it was back then, if not better. The lamb was almost melt-in-my-mouth tender, moist and flavorful. Yet it was so mild that I almost mistook it for beef. The service was as good as the food. Our waitress was so graceful that I suspect she may be the matron of the establishment. She asked us if we wanted to take away our leftover flatbread. When we agreed to that, she brought more warm bread in a carry-out bag. My only regret was that it was too late in the evening to try the Turkish coffee. I hope it won't be 10 years before we do this again!"

                        "review_text": "Hilton Istanbul Bosphorus is renowned for being the first Hilton built outside America, established in 1955. Although the hotel is currently undergoing a remodeling phase, this has not affected the exceptional service provided. The service was impeccable! We stayed in one of the renovated Executive Bosphorus Suites, which included a kitchenette. The room was well-designed and offered a beautiful view of the Bosphorus. Its outstanding location allowed us to easily walk to shops, the metro, and restaurants. We are very grateful to have had the opportunity to stay where history was made.\n\nWe would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the hotel staff for making our stay unforgettable. Everyone contributed to making it exceptionally pleasant. A special thanks to Mr. Murat for his warm welcome and for offering us a two-night upgrade. We also appreciate his assistance in extending our stay to more than a week. His professionalism and kindness were much appreciated.\n\nWe traveled to Istanbul for medical treatment, and this was our second hotel near the clinic we chose to stay at. There were times when we felt down after returning to our room, but the hotel staff made us feel at home and assisted us with our needs. Mr. Ergun, who works in the lounge area, kindly offered us soup and soft foods on the nights when we couldn’t manage solid food for dinner. Mr. Berkay was very kind and supportive, providing us with a variety of refreshments whenever we stopped by for drinks. We are also very grateful to Ms. Tsira from the front office for her assistance and for consistently checking to see if we needed anything.\n\nOur day began with a warm greeting from the wonderful housekeeper, Ms. Fatma, as we headed to breakfast. She cheerfully said, “Good morning,” but I mistakenly thought I heard, “Good night.” When I tried to correct her, she kindly taught me that in Turkish, you say “Günaydın.” This was a valuable lesson from Fatma, who became close to each of us during our stay.  Fatma was more than just a housekeeping staff member; she acted like a caregiver. She often asked my mom how she was feeling and made sure our room was clean and well-stocked. Over our ten-day stay, my mom formed a deep connection with her, making it truly sad to say goodbye to Fatma and the entire hotel staff.\n\nAlso, We would especially like to commend Mr. Erenchan, Hasan, Yasin, and Harvin at the front door for their excellent service with our luggage and transportation needs. They greeted us warmly every time we entered or exited the hotel. The front desk staff, particularly Mr. Cem, was always pleasant, welcoming us with a smile and professionalism. He was consistently ready to assist us with our needs.\nMs. Merven Nur was also frequently available in the lobby, helping guests and providing us with umbrellas when it rained. She often checked to see if there was anything else she could do to assist us. Ms. Merven Nur sent us a heartfelt thank-you card and gifts to our room. On our final evening, Mr. Yusuf arrived at our door with a smile, carrying a bottle of Wine and some Chocolates and Baklava. He set up our table and wished us well. We couldn't have asked for better service; it was customer care at its finest. This touching moment, particularly the kindness and thoughtfulness displayed by Ms. Merven Nur, left a lasting impression on our family. It truly marked a highlight of our stay.\n\nThe attention and customer service at the Hilton Bosphorus were exceptional, deserving a rating of 10 out of 10. Every staff member demonstrated that this hotel is special, historic, and well-managed. It is a place that guests will never forget, where they feel like family, and the atmosphere is just like home. The employees of this historic hotel take pride in serving others and are true ambassadors of Istanbul. They certainly made their city proud.\n\nWe are incredibly grateful for the unforgettable experience and want to express our appreciation to everyone who made our stay exceptionally pleasant. Kudos to the Hilton Istanbul Bosphorus management team!\n\nMany thanks to everyone!"

A lot of light switch / elevator call bouton are not working. And the loud music until past midnight from the restaurant on the 9 floor is really annoying .\nDefinitely not worth the extra money required compared to lower category hotel of the same group\nOnce again, thanks to all the hotel crew who helped to offset most of those annoying things"

The hotel has good location, it’s about 8 mins walk from the taksim Square, although there are hotels in the square, I was glad I chose Barcelo, over the square is chaotic and demonstration happen.

We traveled to Instanbul with my family with 2 teens and got the 2 bedroom suite, we all love the space and value. Thank you again!"

Since we were a large group, I’d gone through the RFP platforms for a handful each of IHG, Hilton, and Marriott hotels. The team at the W was one of the most responsive in getting back with an initial quote, and then working with me on adapting to the needs of our group. We stayed here for a week, but the flexibility was in giving us different checkin / check out dates (given that our team was flying in from many different countries). Huge shoutout to Ezgi from the hotel sales team for personally meeting me and being consistently responsive to help us make an amazing stay for our entire team!\n\nThe hotel itself is furnished to a modern standard and in a hip place in Istanbul. I had some worries based on previous reviews that it might be noisy, but I’m happy to say this wasn’t the case at all and rooms are really well soundproofed. The bar team was extremely friendly and on a fair few days, we ended up closing down the bar. Breakfast was extremely lush, with a wide range of Turkish and Western dishes. I love the design of the shower room makes it look a *bit* like a hammam, which was a great nod to locally-inspired design.\n\nMy only regret is that the terrace area was unfortunately left unexplored due to private events booked during our stay."

It is a short ride near many of the tourist attractions. \n\nThe hotel is located around many restaurants and has a neat aesthetic matching traditional Istanbul buildings. \n\nI was greeted at the door by Omar; he was very helpful and ensured I found all the places I was looking for throughout my stay. He even arranged taxis for me. \n\nUnfortunately, I was feeling ill when I arrived. The receptionist, Azra, informed me that the pharmacies took turns for night shifts in the area and called around to find the open one for me. When I returned, she made me herbal tea with honey. \n\nEvery morning, I was greeted by Sinem. Aside from ensuring I was well-fed every day, she was a delight, full of information and experiences in the city and an absolute joy. \n\nDeniz, who works at the reception, took time to search places up for me and make fun of Azra’s Marvel movie man crushes. \n\nThe hotel staff is fantastic and accommodating. They are very down-to-earth and a treat to talk with. They would greet you, strike up an interesting conversation around the hotel, and show genuine interest in making your stay as fulfilling as possible. Sadly, I could not get all the names of people I had the pleasure of interacting with around the hotel. I would always like to leave credit where it's due. Thank you all for everything."

Kudos to the team for being so prompt with their WhatsApp replies, making reservations for us was a breeze.

Room wise, housekeeping did a great job keeping the room clean."

However .. \n\nUpon entering the room, we noticed how outdated it was. The panel flooring under the shower was worn out, and moldy. The toilet’s wall paper, although nice, but also super old and needs to be replaced .. \n\nThe room has minimal lighting .. It was sooo dark!! We understand there’s ambiance lighting and that the hotel is trying to follow a theme, but this shouldn’t affect the experience negatively. We had to use the flash light on our phone most of the time ..\n\nThe upgrade we received with the cabana is nice. Too bad we couldn’t sit outside although the weather was nice, since the cabana was not clean, nor covered .. Such a pity! \n\nUpon check out we noticed we were charged for a can of soda and a bottle of sparkling water. We had the bottle of water from the airport lounge earlier, and we most certainly did not consume a soda in the room .. It was weird and uncomfortable having to explain these points to the hotel. Luckily both were waived off. \n\nAll in all, the location is good, but the hotel needs MAJOR renovations and upgrade."

Everything is ridiculously overpriced, turning what should be a simple layover into a financial nightmare.\n\nI went to get a quick snack at a coffee shop: a bottle of water, a croissant, and a chocolate bar that looked appealing. When I checked my charge, I was shocked to see over 60 euros on my bill! I thought this must be a mistake and approached the cashier, only to learn that the chocolate bar alone was priced at a staggering 54 euros. Yes, you read that right—a chocolate bar more expensive than a meal at a fancy restaurant.\n\nWhen I insisted on returning the chocolate bar and getting reimbursed, the cashier suddenly developed \"technical problems\" with his cash register. After some back-and-forth, and seeing that I wasn’t going to back down, he begrudgingly handed me 50 euros, likely hoping I would just leave.\n\nThis isn't just expensive; it's outright exploitation. Even the famous Turkish delights (lokum) are overpriced to the point of absurdity—a small 250-gram box for almost 20 euros! It's a blatant rip-off aimed at travelers who don’t know the local prices or don’t have the option to leave the airport.\n\nDo not buy anything at Istanbul Airport. Pack your own snacks or wait until you leave the terminal to shop elsewhere. It's outrageous and shameful for such a modern airport to treat travelers this way. Avoid spending a single cent here if you can."

We were wonderfully surprised when we reached the rainforest not having known it was there before our visit, we spent a lot of time here and you can make a whole day of it, especially when going through to the city centre afterwards. The vending machines and restaurants inside the aquarium were reasonable priced and we grabbed to keepsakes from the gift shop for under £15. We got some amazing photos but everyone visiting could benefit from the aquarium allowing people in in slots to avoid crowds building up"

On the way back, we did better, we took the B1 train to the station Sirkeci (ticket 40 TL) very close to Bosphorus.\nThe aquarium is fabulous, organized by climate-geography zones. A multitude of fish and animals. The entrance is 25 euros, there are rooms with huge aquariums, with sharks, fish, cats seas, turtles, fauna for each area. The aquariums go over the corridors so you can see the animals from all directions. Belly of sharks, cats seas, etc. At the South Pole there are happy penguins, jumping in the water, very cute. It's worth every penny, I recommend it"

                        "review_text": "I ordered tickets through Get Your Ride app which was a bit lower price although included transfer. This trip made my day one of the best in Istanbul (that is usually not very welcoming to small children).\n\nOverall, we had a great time, but the transportation was a bit problematic at the beginning. First, the good news: the aquarium is located in a shopping mall on the shores of the Marmara Sea with fantastic views. The aquarium itself is amazing, my kids aged 2, 5, and 8 were incredibly excited. Sharks, moray eels, penguins - they loved it most. The price through the official website is slightly higher than through Get Your Ride, although the latter also includes a transfer. The journey takes about half an hour, we were picked up by a minibus. After the aquarium, you can go to one of the restaurants or to the food court, where the view is even better, as it is higher. In the food court, you can find the main Turkish fast foods and have a budget lunch with a view of the sea, ships, seagulls, and planes. After that, you can go shopping, there are both budget and more expensive brands, local and global brands.\nNow about the cons:\n * The meeting point was indicated incorrectly!!! The bus picks up from the end of Sultanahmet Square, where the university is, but the app shows the opposite end at the German fountain. Be sure to call the number indicated on the voucher, WhatsApp is also possible.\n * The bus was 15 minutes late, and the bus itself had a strong smell, either of cigarettes or just old. My daughter felt bad at the end of the trip.\n * The girls in the aquarium insisted on taking a photo against a green background. I asked, \"Do you want to sell me the photos on a fake background later?\" They replied, \"No, it's for the system.\" I ask: \"For what system?\" They: \"I don't know, I just work here.\" In the end, I just walked past, of course, at the end there was a shop with photos a la 2000s.\n * I would have loved to spend more time in the mall, but our interval was 11:00-16:00. Of course, you can go back by metro or bus, but even the smelly transfer is still more convenient than public transport.\n* Price discrimination against tourists is frustrating. While it's understandable that locals might have lower incomes, it makes tourists to feel robbed. It's no surprise that taxi drivers often overcharge tourists, as this is government policy to charge tourists 2-10x times than locals. Perhaps local discounts could be offered through other platforms to prevent tourists from feeling exploited.\n\nDespite the cons, we had a great day and are very happy with our choice."

Today was the day that I visited this massive shopping mall and I can say that I am impressed but not thoroughly. I went to the cinema to watch SAW 10 and it was really good but the popcorn prices are absolutely ridiculous. There is no option to get popcorn on its own. Rather, you can only get that along with coke and the prices are literally 100 lira. I don't know if that would be cheap for you but there is no way it would worth more than 70 lira for 2 cans of coke and a bucket of popcorn. After the cinema I went to a jacket potato restaurant and I had one jacket potato along with a can of coke. I paid 150 lira in total which I think was a bit expensive. \nThere are tens of different brands to choose from which I think is really convenient as this caters to different budgets.\nWhen I went to the loo, I was absolutely disgusted by how horrible and obnoxious the toilets looked. They need to hire more people to keep the toilets clean because it looked like a cesspit. I don't even want to talk about the smell in there as I tried to hold by breath.\nAll in all I would go back to that mall but they need to sort out the toilet issue.\n"

My girlfriend ordered asparagus risotto, and we also tried the seafood linguine, which was tasty but not my personal preference as I'm not a big fan of seafood pasta. It's important to note that if you're planning a birthday celebration, Strada doesn't allow you to bring your own birthday cake for some reason.

Great hospitality approach starting from reception and particularly from owner Zejnep who really paid attention on our needs during our stay.

Although the hotel is currently undergoing a remodeling phase, this has not affected the exceptional service provided. The service was impeccable! We stayed in one of the renovated Executive Bosphorus Suites, which included a kitchenette. The room was well-designed and offered a beautiful view of the Bosphorus. Its outstanding location allowed us to easily walk to shops, the metro, and restaurants. We are very grateful to have had the opportunity to stay where history was made.\n\nWe would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the hotel staff for making our stay unforgettable. Everyone contributed to making it exceptionally pleasant. A special thanks to Mr. Murat for his warm welcome and for offering us a two-night upgrade. We also appreciate his assistance in extending our stay to more than a week. His professionalism and kindness were much appreciated.\n\nWe traveled to Istanbul for medical treatment, and this was our second hotel near the clinic we chose to stay at. There were times when we felt down after returning to our room, but the hotel staff made us feel at home and assisted us with our needs. Mr. Ergun, who works in the lounge area, kindly offered us soup and soft foods on the nights when we couldn’t manage solid food for dinner. Mr. Berkay was very kind and supportive, providing us with a variety of refreshments whenever we stopped by for drinks. We are also very grateful to Ms. Tsira from the front office for her assistance and for consistently checking to see if we needed anything.\n\nOur day began with a warm greeting from the wonderful housekeeper, Ms. Fatma, as we headed to breakfast. She cheerfully said, “Good morning,” but I mistakenly thought I heard, “Good night.” When I tried to correct her, she kindly taught me that in Turkish, you say “Günaydın.” This was a valuable lesson from Fatma, who became close to each of us during our stay.  Fatma was more than just a housekeeping staff member; she acted like a caregiver. She often asked my mom how she was feeling and made sure our room was clean and well-stocked. Over our ten-day stay, my mom formed a deep connection with her, making it truly sad to say goodbye to Fatma and the entire hotel staff.\n\nAlso, We would especially like to commend Mr. Erenchan, Hasan, Yasin, and Harvin at the front door for their excellent service with our luggage and transportation needs. They greeted us warmly every time we entered or exited the hotel. The front desk staff, particularly Mr. Cem, was always pleasant, welcoming us with a smile and professionalism. He was consistently ready to assist us with our needs.\nMs. Merven Nur was also frequently available in the lobby, helping guests and providing us with umbrellas when it rained. She often checked to see if there was anything else she could do to assist us. Ms. Merven Nur sent us a heartfelt thank-you card and gifts to our room. On our final evening, Mr. Yusuf arrived at our door with a smile, carrying a bottle of Wine and some Chocolates and Baklava. He set up our table and wished us well. We couldn't have asked for better service; it was customer care at its finest. This touching moment, particularly the kindness and thoughtfulness displayed by Ms. Merven Nur, left a lasting impression on our family. It truly marked a highlight of our stay.\n\nThe attention and customer service at the Hilton Bosphorus were exceptional, deserving a rating of 10 out of 10. Every staff member demonstrated that this hotel is special, historic, and well-managed. It is a place that guests will never forget, where they feel like family, and the atmosphere is just like home. The employees of this historic hotel take pride in serving others and are true ambassadors of Istanbul. They certainly made their city proud.\n\nWe are incredibly grateful for the unforgettable experience and want to express our appreciation to everyone who made our stay exceptionally pleasant. Kudos to the Hilton Istanbul Bosphorus management team!\n\nMany thanks to everyone!"

Everything is ridiculously overpriced, turning what should be a simple layover into a financial nightmare.\n\nI went to get a quick snack at a coffee shop: a bottle of water, a croissant, and a chocolate bar that looked appealing. When I checked my charge, I was shocked to see over 60 euros on my bill! I thought this must be a mistake and approached the cashier, only to learn that the chocolate bar alone was priced at a staggering 54 euros. Yes, you read that right—a chocolate bar more expensive than a meal at a fancy restaurant.\n\nWhen I insisted on returning the chocolate bar and getting reimbursed, the cashier suddenly developed \"technical problems\" with his cash register. After some back-and-forth, and seeing that I wasn’t going to back down, he begrudgingly handed me 50 euros, likely hoping I would just leave.\n\nThis isn't just expensive; it's outright exploitation. Even the famous Turkish delights (lokum) are overpriced to the point of absurdity—a small 250-gram box for almost 20 euros! It's a blatant rip-off aimed at travelers who don’t know the local prices or don’t have the option to leave the airport.\n\nDo not buy anything at Istanbul Airport. Pack your own snacks or wait until you leave the terminal to shop elsewhere. It's outrageous and shameful for such a modern airport to treat travelers this way. Avoid spending a single cent here if you can."

I am an avid traveler covered more than 25 countries and my experience with White House and the staff is very unique and unforgettable and would highly recommend this amazing hotel. \n\nThe dedicated staff went out of their way to help and care for us. From the lobby receptionists to the staff at breakfast and the hotel manager Mr. Kemal, we were met with amazing service and care. \n\nThe hotel is in a great location, just a short walk away from some of the main attractions in Sultanahmet with plenty of restaurants nearby. The rooms are very cozy with royal accents. Rooftop breakfast has a great variety and spread with an amazing view and the staff managing breakfast always greeted us with a warm smile. \n\nThe hotel staff is extremely dedicated and helped us with anything we needed. The hotel owner Mr. Harun, his friend Mr. Halit went out of their way to help us during an unexpected event where we needed to visit a hospital. They called several hospitals to check which would be best for us and even arranged transportation. Mr. Halit and Mr. Kemal even accompanied us to the hospital and stayed with us until we were finished. \n\nWe cannot thank the staff at the White House Hotel enough for their warm hospitality and for going out of the way to help us and make this trip so memorable."

The pastry not fresh, the choice of fruit or hot dish is weak. The coffee machines always in “cleaning mode”\nThe wood floor in the room definitely need a deep clean or even resurfacing . A lot of light switch / elevator call bouton are not working. And the loud music until past midnight from the restaurant on the 9 floor is really annoying .\nDefinitely not worth the extra money required compared to lower category hotel of the same group\nOnce again, thanks to all the hotel crew who helped to offset most of those annoying things"
