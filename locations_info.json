See the thing is when I did that I was pretty disappointed with the coffee didn't have the expected taste and it wasn't the quantity of shots added to the coffee it was just the lack of taste overall. When we told the attendant she didn't appreciated it and started explaining that depending of the size of the drink it was the quantity of shots added. They decided to replaced the beverage with more \"flavor shots' with the same result and also with the same explanation ( and by this time we didn't appreciate also).

People have to bring everything and that is probably why these are used more often by local families. They have one room with two sets of bunk beds (for four people) and a room with a full size bed. Kitchens have a full size fridge and stove. There is only one celing fan. The villas are a bit different because they have ac units but I have not stayed there. I have, however, heard that they are moldy because of the ac.\n\nOur caba√±a was clean and in really good shape. The indoor space is small but the terrace is nice and there is plenty of space to put hammocks and beach chairs if you bring them. In reality you are there to enjoy the beach, pool, etc., not to stay indoors. We stayed in a unit close to the beach and with plenty of green areas arounds us. The water heater, stove, and fridge worked well.  \n\nYou will have to bring pillows and bed linens, towels, pots, pans, kitchens utensils, food, bathroom toiletries, etc. Think of it more like a camping site but instead of a camper or a tent you get to sleep indoors after partying or enjoying a beach day.\n\nYou will most likely have neighbors close to you, listening to music and enjoying themselves. If you are looking for a place worry-free this is probably not the place for you.\n\nMy only complaint is that they are not pet friendly, which I understand. But while I made arrangements for my dog to stay elsewhere during that weekend other people had dogs in their units and no one said anything about that.

I say this to warn non PR residents that if they want special tourist like treatment, this will not be it.  The cabanas and villas are rustic and customer service is almost non existent.  The real benefit of this place is family bonding.  Close to other great beach venues and sites. When I travel to PR, this is the place our family chooses to go and bond. (Always wear shoes when walking on the beach or in the water...) The most amazing sunsets will be captured from this side of the island...."

From the moment we arrived, Wilson and Christina welcomed us like we were family.  The apartments were spotless, had all the amenities we needed and more and we used both the grill and kitchen for a few meals which helped with keeping our vacation budget on point.  Upon arrival there was water, coffee, snacks, fresh fruit and essentials which helped so much after a long day of traveling with kids.  They thought of so many details to make our stay so enjoyable.  Beach chairs, umbrellas, cooler, wood and sticks for s‚Äômores over the campfire, kites for the kids to fly on the beach, bait to fish, lifejackets of all sizes for the days with bigger waves if needed.  Having access to inner tubes, kayak/paddleboard, horseback riding or the kids, fishing poles just made things so EASY.  Anyone that travels with kids knows these details matter and Wilson and Christina thought of everything.  The magic of this place was beyond anything you can imagine.  The wild horses on the beach were majestic.  Shells, glass and beach pottery from every color in the rainbow, sunsets you dream about, and so many interesting foods to try ranging from fresh fruit from the trees in the backyard to empanadas and goodies from the bakery just a short stroll away.  We literally went to sleep and woke up every morning to the most beautiful sounds of waves and birds singing.  My 4 yo who hasn‚Äôt slept past 530 am since the day she was born slept until 830 in the morning ‚Äì it was an island miracle!  Honestly, this is the kind of place you dream about.  We were only minutes away from Rincon as well (I think 8-10 max) so were able to enjoy the local beaches and town including a great art walk on Thursday night and farmers market on Sunday.  I cannot say enough good things about this place- as the website states ‚Äúwe will be back!‚Äù."

Our apartment was 2 bedrooms (one queen, one twin bunks) 1 bath, on a beautiful shaded lot right on a gorgeous, calm beach!  The kitchen was adequately equipped for cooking so you don't have to eat out every meal for your vacation, and the living room area is comfortable for a family of 4 to enjoy some down time either playing board games or watching tv in the air conditioning. The lovely, large yard has multiple places to relax in either shade or sun, a volleyball net, a fire pit, a bbq grill, and a cool outdoor shower. To top all of this off, walk through the back gate, and step onto a gorgeous beach  with calm water that's perfect for playing and seems almost private! Anasco itself, is a quaint town with friendly people and a very short drive ( 4 to 5 minutes) to the busier activities of Rincon. I can't wait to go back!"

Starting with the hosts, they are simply amazing you can tell the love that they have for this place and you feel the serenity and peace once you arrive. They explained everything to us and where everything was and each apartment had their set of keys(which I loved). Rooms were all comfortable, they all have air conditioners in them and are comfortable. Everything was clean, they have everything you need from soap to towels. We did some grocery shopping at the near by stores if you need something extra last minute there‚Äôs a Walgreens not even 10 minutes away. On our special day the sunset was simply perfect for pictures that even our photographer was stunned by, the sun was completely perfect and the view that you get from the beach and background mountains is more than perfectüòç Words can‚Äôt explain how extremely happy I am with everything and thankfulü§ó love this place extremely recommended."

Comes complete with a heart shaped jacuzzi tub that likely will not be used. Also a large walk in closet. \nUpdates needed: the bathroom light in the middle of the ceiling leaked when it rained, wouldn‚Äôt lean on the porch rails that are rusted through, the sinks need power bleach to remove the grime and OSHCA may not approve of the exit sign hanging from an exposed wire. \nWe ate a burger at the poolside bar upon our arrive, waiting for the room the be ready and decided we wouldn‚Äôt dine on property again during our 3 night stay.

It is not a luxury resort, but a building with approximately 10 appartments. It does not have a reception, but the owner lives across the street and a caretaker is around every day.\nThe appartment is not very big, but big enough for us. The kitchen is basic, but it functions and the fridge is huge (for Dutch standards :-). \n\nIn the weekends there were some more people, but it was quiet during the week, we often had the big and beautiful swimmingpool to ourselves. The beach is in the backyard; as the resort is nearly at the end of a dead-end street, the area and beach are very quiet, we often had the beach to ourselves too. Added bonus for us are the friendly cats that live around the place. And for me personally it was a very good bonus that the area is rich in birds. I have spotted several of the endemic Puerto Rican birdspecies during short walks from Yukayeke. Last but not least: we went swimming in the sea after dark and there was amazing bioluminescence. You don't have to go to La Parguera to see it, the effect here was even better!\n\nThere are three restaurants in walking distance that are open in weekends. A bit further away, but still close, are twoo shops in the village La Playa. A 15 minute drive brings you to a shopping centre with supermarket etc."

We found the perfect price vs amenities choice. Yukayeke Playa Resort was at one time more luxurious, true. What it is now, is  comfortable, with a magnificent pool, a friendly atmosphere, adjacent beach and gorgeous gardens. Manager was supportive and helpful. Apparently the resort is for sale, which will mean the price will increase and the rooms will become bland and luxurious in that uniform, boring, no surprises way. Right now it is quirky, and unique. A great place to bring the family, the family pet, friends or anyone who will not complain if everything is not picture perfect. The complete kitchens allow flexibility."

The ocean and beach are nice and clam and very walkable. The hotel itself is a little old but still the amenities are good however we  did get an electric shock every time we turned on the bathroom light and the fan did not work in our room. We never saw any staff there during our 4 day stay so there was no one there ever to ask for help as the office was always closed and locked, maybe on our 4th day but by then we were leaving.  We could of used more than only two towels for a family of four.   Could have been because of the holidays but still would have been nice to exchange dirty towels after a few days.   Although we had a full size kitchen, a dish towel and some dish soap would have helped as we cooked most days. The area/town doesn't really have anything and you have to drive to Rincon for anything. You will need a car in this area. It is a better area to stay than Rincon but it's isolated in term of action. The Wifi only worked intermittently by the pool, so if you need strong wifi or it in your rooms you won't have it."

If you ha e a big truck it may be difficult to maneuver and park.  If your parking is in the side were the restaurant is, then, expect to have a bit of traffic in and out during the weekend.\n\nI‚Äôm not sure of this is normal.  But  Saturday night there was some kind of small band singing covers .  Good songs that made you want to sit, drink or eat something, and listen to the live music.\n\nWe didn‚Äôt used the hotel pool as we had tickets for a water park about 30 minutes from the hotel.  There is plenty to do around.  Check here in TripAdvisor for things to do in Cabo Rojo, San German, Mayaguez, A√±asco, Rincon, and Aguadilla.  Depending on destination  and traffic the longest trip will be about an hour."

The owner is a very nice lady willing to provide advice and feedback of places to go and eat.  We felt safe and it was private.   We will come back for sure.  Like I said, we were and still are locals...we know the area, and this place is an excellent cost effective option.

Every evening, I had to go to the front desk asking items that we ran out off such as toilet paper, tissues, towels, etc. On Friday and Saturday, I went to the front desk asking to please clean my room. Nothing, Sunday morning at 10:31 AM, I  especifically told them to clean my room because it had not been serviced since the day we arrived, and we were going to be out ALL DAY! When we arrived around 10:00 PM the room was still untouched. Monday, I spoke with a manager, and she told me that my room was not serviced because I have a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door at 8:00 AM. I explained that we remove it every morning as we leave, sometimes between 9 to 10 AM, besides the checkout time is Noon. She gave me a voucher for 2 complimentary breakfasts. Things were fine for a few days. Then I found a note from housekeeping informing that the towels \"will be brought soon\". (There were No towels of any size when we arrived at 8:45 PM). By 9, I went to the front desk, told them about the note, they said it was placed around 5 to 6 PM and that they will call housekeeping. At 9:00 PM, No towels, yet. After attempting to call the front desk 3 times in 15 minutes getting a busy sound, I dialed housekeping myself. I was told that he was not aware of that, but to give him 10 minutes. He arrived around 9:45 PM and apologized. The next day, and for the 3 following days, housekeeping didn't show up. Once again, I spoke with a manager. If it wasn't because my husband refused to move to another hotel, I would have left by day 3! The pool is only 4 feet deep and a disapointment for my granddaughter who is on a swimming team! The food was no that good either, My husband and I ordered a pi√±a colada and received 1 ounce of drink covered with whipped cream and a chery! We literally have to eat the whipped cream with a spoon like ice cream and most of the food on the platter of fried appetizers were burned. In 49 years of traveling all over the USA, Canada and Europe, Have i ever had such a bad service!The day before checking out, the manager called to give us another free breakfast. (Maybe to a peace me).  I don't give a 0 because it is not possible."

The cabana is a small building with one door entrance and a sliding security (Double) window. There are 2 rooms one with a moderate queen bed and a second room with 2 double bunk beds (one on top of another). There is a small kitchen with a stove top and a medium size refrigerator and a sink. There ia an overhead Fan that covers the two bedrooms. Six persons fit in the cabana. I almost forgot the small bathroom with a sink, toilet and shower. Pretty neat for something basic near the beach and pool facility to party.I believe it is a very good deal for 53 dollars a nite. I give this place a 4 out of 5. I also recommend it."

People have to bring everything and that is probably why these are used more often by local families. They have one room with two sets of bunk beds (for four people) and a room with a full size bed. Kitchens have a full size fridge and stove. There is only one celing fan. The villas are a bit different because they have ac units but I have not stayed there. I have, however, heard that they are moldy because of the ac.\n\nOur caba√±a was clean and in really good shape. The indoor space is small but the terrace is nice and there is plenty of space to put hammocks and beach chairs if you bring them. In reality you are there to enjoy the beach, pool, etc., not to stay indoors. We stayed in a unit close to the beach and with plenty of green areas arounds us. The water heater, stove, and fridge worked well.  \n\nYou will have to bring pillows and bed linens, towels, pots, pans, kitchens utensils, food, bathroom toiletries, etc. Think of it more like a camping site but instead of a camper or a tent you get to sleep indoors after partying or enjoying a beach day.\n\nYou will most likely have neighbors close to you, listening to music and enjoying themselves. If you are looking for a place worry-free this is probably not the place for you.\n\nMy only complaint is that they are not pet friendly, which I understand. But while I made arrangements for my dog to stay elsewhere during that weekend other people had dogs in their units and no one said anything about that. I didn't think that was fair, the rules should be applied to everyone."

The real benefit of this place is family bonding.  Close to other great beach venues and sites. When I travel to PR, this is the place our family chooses to go and bond.

The view is beautiful and you can see most of A√±asco bay.\n\nIt was full of graffiti for many years, but it has been renovated recently. As of today (July 17, 2019) is still clean, but I am sure it will be vandalized soon (everything does) and some graffiti will damage the structure. The place has 4 restaurants in the immediate area. Is a good spot for pictures."

They were very responsive and went overboard to make sure I had everything needed.\n\nThe house in Anasco was very spacious, and had everything needed for staying in and cooking dinner or just lounging on the front porch or BBQing in the backyard.\n\nIt was a great base to go north to Rincon, Aguada and Aguadilla, but also to head south to Mayaguez, Cabo Rojo and Combate Beach!\n\nThe house is located in a quiet neighborhood and Maria lives right across the street. You can see how meticulous she is by the quality of the garden and yard she keeps around her home. She is a hard worker and smiles all the time, always happy to say hello and see how the day went.\n\nI look forward to staying here again in the future and can highly recommend this as a great alternative to the busier beachfront resorts or more traditional hotels."
