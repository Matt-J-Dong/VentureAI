I got the cheese wheel pasta, it is simply plain pasta with melted cheese on. My friend had the bolognese which was just standard bolognese. \n\nIf you’re British, I’ve genuinely had better food at a hungry horse. Honestly, save your money and go to McDonald’s because it’s a lot better. \n\nThis would be fine, if the bill didn’t come to €103 for two pasta dishes and two drinks 😟\n\nThe customer service wasn’t anything out of the ordinary, wasn’t good, wasn’t bad either. \n\nAlso, I suppose it doesn’t have anything to do with the restaurant itself, but a man attempted to mug me right outside of the restaurant and then walked into the restaurant to be served."

The beds were comfortable, the room was very clean, and the shower was probably the largest hotel shower I've ever seen. We had the prefix brunch at the Eiffel Tower restaurant; I highly recommend the creme brulee french toast, it was incredible. I would definitely stay at Paris again."

Paris moved us to another room on the same floor and we settled in.  Only to realize the sink would not provide Warm to Hot water until it was running for 10-15 minutes straight.   This is huge with more than one person in the room, and a complete waste of water.   Oddly enough, the shower would warm up in a normal manner.  Secondly, the TV would lose internet connectivity so often that we would give up on watching TV in the early morning or evening."

Nice table in garden room.. very good Regnard wine.. we ordered 2 Croque Monsieur and  a chicken Caesar Salad.. the service was very good.. polite, friendly and professional... the food was a let down, unfortunately.. it was well presented and in a timely fashion.. but the salad was lacking in taste and flavour.. the Croque was described as average by those who ate it.. cocktails after lunch were lovely... it was a pity about the food.. fabulous place though.. our wine waiter, Axel, was the epitome of French charm at it's best.."

The rooms were SO hot and humid ALL THE TIME and the AC wouldn’t work and the windows won’t open fully. \nThirdly, the beds were incredibly uncomfortable and the pillows didn’t support our necks at all - we all woke up with sore necks and backs the next morning with barely any sleep. \nFourthly, everything was VERY overpriced- 3€ for 500ml of water?? MAD. And 7.50€ to rent a towel?? HELLO??? \nI could name incidents that occurred when I stayed but I feel I could get into trouble if I mention them. But AVOID THIS HOSTEL AT ALL COST!!"

And the price was pretty good but the location isn't so great. To be polite, it's not in a great area, so usually when I got up for the day I would immediately take the metro and head towards more central Paris to find a cafe or something. (Though the metro is extremely close so that was nice!) They do have luggage storage you can pay for, but it's easier to just keep it in your room (in my opinion). And I had 2 giant pieces of luggages which I was able to just put in the corner of the room and had no issues. (And then I put my backpack and whatnot in the storage under the bed.) \n\nThe room was clean but just seemed like it wasn't super well maintained. I only say that because it seemed the window was broken and there was a temporary sign saying not to open it. (So the room would sometimes get a little stuffy/warm since we couldn't let any fresh air in.) And the hinges on my storage container under the bed were broken. Minor things of course, but worth mentioning. \n\nI had great experiences with the people I had in my room, they were all very friendly and I even spent a couple days walking around Paris with a couple of them! No issues at all with it being a mixed dorm. (I liked to refer to them as my \"temporary friends\" bc we would chat and hang out in Paris for a few days and then one of us would check out of the hostel and have to say goodbye lol.) \n\nAnd the staff were very lovely and helpful and are happy to help in English or French.\n\nOverall I had a pleasant stay, but I just wanted to be honest about some of the negative points that I didn't see in other reviews before I booked.

The Peninsula is well stated elegance and cool and calm and serene with just enough edge of excitement.  The rooms are very nice and well supported by the technology that is part of their now standard array (we were at the new Peninsula in Istanbul in August and will provide a separate review). We were met at the door by Rana Martin form guest services and escorted to our room. The suite was nice and well appointed and very comfortable. A lovely selection of fruit and macrons awaited us and the flowers and appointments in the room were lovely and very proper and home. Rana is a gem in all respects.\n\nThe hallmark of The Peninsula has become its persons. Everyone greets you with a welcoming smile and treats you as an honored guest. The entire Concierge staff assisted with our flowers for our room and our challenging requests for restaurant reservations. This was handled by the entire team including Jeremie and Célia and Clotilde and Christophe (the entire very large and capable team is always happy and eager to be of assistance!). Pro traveler tip: get the WhatsApp contact to the Concierge Team and make your asks in real time and enjoy immediate and professional support before and during your stay. The service levels they provide are exactly why one stays at The Peninsula as they do everything with a smile and sense of pride that enhances the experience.\n\nWe caught up on much needed sleep at the hotel during our stay. It has been a long time since we traveled without our wonderful kids and the peace and quiet were spectacular. We enjoyed excellent room service breakfast daily and appreciated the highest quality linens and bedding and bath products. \n\nThank you to the entire staff from front of house to housekeeping for a wonderful stay."

The rooms have been incredibly soundproofed and designed with a comfortable elegance that is perfect for relaxing after a long day of perusing the streets. Additionally, the service is kind, helpful, and a delight. \n\nThe only dings (and they’re small ones), are the firmness of the mattress, the tiny size of the gym, and, the Cantonese restaurant whose food is TERRIBLE. Also, if this is your first trip to Paris, it’s not in the most central location but the metro is so easy to navigate it shouldn’t matter."

I had chosen to go to the lobby while waiting for a friend, with the intention of having a drink right after. To my great surprise, I was simply “kicked out” of the lobby under the pretext that I was not drinking immediately and that I was not expecting anyone residing at the hotel.\nPeople ask me who exactly I'm waiting for, what an indiscretion!\nI have never been treated in such a humiliating manner in an establishment of this magnitude. I have gone very often to have breakfasts and even lunches in this establishment where I will never return, I will obviously tell my experience to other people around me\nA man named SAÏD (I wonder how he was able to obtain such a position in charge of security) was arrogant, indelicate and disrespectful. I was made to feel like an unwanted intruder, even though I was planning to spend money at the hotel.\nThis behavior is unbecoming of a hotel of this reputation, and I strongly advise anyone not to go there if you expect a minimum of courtesy and professionalism. There are many other establishments in Paris that know how to treat their customers with respect and consideration, which is clearly not the case here.\nAbsolutely not worthy of a palace!"

The regency club is well worth it. Free full delicious breakfast every Day and 6-9pm happy hour with delicious snacks. The location was also ideal since port Msillot station a short walk or shortcut through Congres mall. Also walking distance toL’ étoile and the iconic L’Arc de Triomphe.

We were so excited as that was the best way to see the local life and experience the local delicacy. \n\nMy room was upgraded and was located at the corner, can enjoy the Eiffel Tower view at the living room. The living room is spacious. We also have a mini kitchenette too. So convenient to cook/reheat the food as there are stoves and microwave oven.\n\nI love the water and coffee/tea dispenser machines at the lobby. Unlimited coffee/tea, hot chocolate, still & sparkling water are available 24hours. \n\nThe lobby is not very big but it is cozy & modern + clean. You need to have keycard to access to the entrance from outside. Same goes to the guest floors access with keycard only for safety control.\n\nWhen the train passing by, the vibration will notify you for every trip as the train railway just next to the hotel.\n\nThe whole staying experience can be enhanced further if we could feel the warm service + more cheerful smile to make us at ease, especially when we are travelling to a foreign country that we are not familiar with the local language, culture and environment. \n\nWarm service + friendly smile can earn another 2 stars to perfection for this stay!"

The front desk attendants were always courteous, patient and helpful (yes, they all spoke English). Our room was clean and comfortable. Very spacious. We didn't chose a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower, which turned out to be a good choice for us  because once you leave the hotel, the Tower is in view from practically everywhere. A few quirks to be aware of; the key card needs to stay inserted in the room for the lights to work, and you must tap the key card to the motion sensor in the elevator or it won't go anywhere. Hopefully this tip will help others avoid our fate, which was to look like complete American idiots, pushing the button repeatedly to no avail until someone from the desk came to rescue us.  Our room was very quiet. There is an overhead train directly across the street. We could barely hear it, but we were on the other side of the building. I don't know if it is loud from the Eiffel-facing rooms. Of course, this was wonderful for getting around, as the Metro station is right across the street. There are a host of restaurants and shops in the neighborhood and the Eiffel Tower is within easy walking distance. Our only substantive criticism is that the air conditioning didn't keep the room very cool. It was in the 80's and humid during our stay, and the room was quite warm even with the air turned to the coldest setting. I imagine we'll have to get used to other countries being more energy conscious than the U.S. Overall, I would highly recommend Citadines Tour Eiffel!"

Restaurant is cozy and big enough to have perfect breakfast. Various and tasty selections for breakfast. You can have perfect start to your day\nLocation - Amazing. Its a bit away (30min walk) from Elysees but the walking way is along Seine is very nice/quite and plenty of things to discover about Paris. With taxi max 10min driving. But if you are fan of Eiffel - its the best location. From hotel to trocadero 10min nice walking way with perfect view.\nStaff - Very helpfull. Especially Sarah GR manager and Stolic Tea who helped a lot. \nRoom Size - I had deluxe room with balcony. Amazing room with Eiffel view and Size is perfect. You can relax there. \nEntertainment - No need to go outside for nice PAris evening - at least 2 nights. 1 nigt you can spend at top roof restaurant and enjoy Eiffel nioght view. and 2nd night in lobby restaurant where superb DJ is playing with cozy atmoshphere. Other nights you can go out ))\nThe only improvement area - in Deluxe room its not good to have  2 twin beds combined as King Bed)). Despite it did not affect lot, King bed itself makes big difference compare dto 2 twin beds combined as KING :)\nThanks Hotel team for their help in making my 5day trip to Paris relaxing and enjoyiable.

BUT I had the worst night’s sleep in a hotel of my life. The rooms with interconnecting doors to adjacent rooms (I was in 305) have absolutely no sound insulation from the adjoining rooms. The inconsiderate guest in Room 304 on 5th November talked on a phone for many hours, eventually finishing about 0430. And that was an hour after I had asked him to be quiet: he apologised…but carried on unabated. The doors are so thin, I could hear both his voice and that of his contact even though the phone was not on speaker. Value for money? Absolutely not."

As a business traveler, I specifically asked the hotel staff if all charges—including breakfast and room service—could be included on a single invoice for reimbursement purposes. They assured me this was possible. However, when I checked out, I discovered that these charges had already been processed separately by credit card and could not be added to the main invoice. The hotel staff claimed they didn’t have access to the restaurant charges, which was both unexpected and unacceptable. For business travelers who need comprehensive billing for expenses, this is a serious issue. While the hotel may be adequate for tourists, I would not recommend it for business stays due to their inability to consolidate charges properly. This experience was frustrating and potentially against standard hotel practices."

The history of the Catacombs dates back to the late 18th century when the city's cemeteries were closed due to health reasons and its contents were moved to an underground site. Today, you can walk down the spiral staircase and take a guided tour of the network of tunnels or explore it at your own pace. It's recommended to buy skip-the-line tickets online to avoid snaking lines. You can easily reach the Catacombs by hopping on the Paris Metro. – Tripadvisor",

Additionally, there are damp gravel pathways and it's fairly dim down there.  My 75 y/o father did not enjoy it due to these issues.  I think they are well spelled out before you enter, but it was a lot for him.\n\nThere is also a long underground walk from the entrance building to the first sites, so again not a good idea if you have limited mobility."

However, the ticket they gave us wouldn’t validate. When I went back to the staff for help, they told me to join the line again, even though it was super long and we were running late.\n\nI politely asked for assistance again, but instead of helping, the staff started using foul language. I was with my sister, and we didn’t have time to argue, so I just let it go. In the end, they opened the gate for us, but it was a terrible experience.\n\nI wouldn’t recommend using the metro if you’re short on time. The staff was rude and unhelpful, and honestly, it didn’t feel safe. It’s disappointing that behavior like this goes unchecked."

Just after going through we were surrounded by 3 guards aggressively wanting to check tickets. When my partners was said to be 'invalid' as if it had not gone through the barrier they demanded a €60 fine - no discussion. We explained we had just bought it with help from a staff member for the final journey we needed to make back to the Eurostar and asked if we could point her out. She stormed off and refused to let us point her out. When she returned she said the ticket office staff said no one helped!! They said they would call police which would raise the fine to €200. They were bullying and aggressive and it was very clear there was a genuine mistake as they had watched us the whole time buying the ticket and go through. \nWe will never visit Paris again and if you are going avoid the Metro - there is definately scamming there with tourists from the very people who should be looking out for you. What an awful way to treat tourists. Made me appreciate the UK and Londons underground staff. We were glad to be home and will not visit France again ever."

I had lived in Paris 30 years ago, but my wife and kids were new to the city.\n\nThe Paris Metro system is fantastic. If you are staying in the city you are probably less than 250m from an entrance into the Metro and your destination is equally close to a stop. If your destination is on the same line as your start location just follow the signs for that line - there will be 2 options, one for each direction, and the direction is indicated by the name of the last station in that direction. Sometimes they will also list out the stops in each direction, but not always. If its on a different line you will need to change - this involves getting off at a stop and following signs for the next line/direction you need to take. You won't have to leave the Metro system, so you don't need a second ticket. \nWe used the phone app Bonjour RATP to see the best route (including transfers). I would suggest practice using this app before you go if you are new to subway systems.\n\nWe used paper tickets as we didn't know how much we'd use the Metro, but a Navigo Easy card each preloaded with tickets would have been cheaper and simpler. There are other options such as day passes etc. The paper tickets we bought were called t+ tickets and they cover any journeys within the metro system except to Orly Airport.\n\nHang on to your ticket until you leave the Metro system! Twice we had to use the same ticket twice as there was a second set of turnstiles for some reason. Also, while we didn't see any ticket inspectors, they do check tickets and you'll be fined if you have thrown your ticket away.\n\nA few words of warning:\n\nTake precautions against pick pockets - they will target tourists and its hard to look like a local! Carriages can be crowded so valuables need to be well secured. We didn't see any pickpockets, but there were warnings everywhere. I also bought any tickets in Republique rather than the more touristy stations.\n\nWe took the Metro from Universite Saint Denis to Republic and back as we arrived on the bus from Beauvais airport. I felt it was quite challenging travelling as a family with suitcases in rush hour. We had to manoeuvre to make sure we were near the carriage doors so we could get out in time (Parisiens are impressively polite though!) If the kids were younger I would have looked into another form of transportation for this journey.\n\nThe system is old, and unlike more modern systems it doesn't seem very accessible. If you are unable to use stairs then do your research before travelling - while some stations have lifts I didn't see many.\n\nSome Metro journeys involve quite a bit of walking within the system (to/from platforms, between lines etc)\n\nSome trains are very busy - so you'll find yourself quite squashed in. The longest wait time we saw was 4 minutes though, so if you are concerned about a train being excessively full, then wait for the next one.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall we took 12 journeys on the Metro in 3.5 days, most journeys took less than 20 minutes. We stayed in Republique, which has a number of lines, so most journeys didn't need a transfer. We packed loads into our trip to Paris and there is no way we could have seen and done as much without such an efficient form of transportation, and the kids really enjoyed the novelty of it."

I wasted like €20  because the ticket cost €35 to begin with, that was meant to last 72 hours stopped working in 24 hours.\n\nThe staff will refuse to speak english and make you buy a Navigo card and ignore the fact you paid for a ticket. The Navigo card is better.\n\nSubway was frequent if not crowded, easy to navigate and get around."

Our tours are in English and last for around 3 hours. They include some walking and standing, but also feature a seated tasting with wine pairings. Our tours are designed for adults. We’re unable to host children under ten years of age. Our price of 125€ per person is a little higher than the competition because we spend more than anyone else on premium tastings and to pay the most experienced and knowledgable guides in Paris.

Everything we ate was delicous and we even got a little history along the way. We ate croissants, fresh baguette, chocolate/candies, cheese, wine and some traditional french food as well. Our walking tour ended at a wine store where we did the wine and cheese tasting. Our group was the perfect size (3 couples with our tour guided). I couldn't recommend this enough!"

We saw the glasswalk at the 3rd floor and went there, to find out they work with reservations with time-slots. Luckily the ladies in charge helped us to make the reservation on the spot and we could go without too much of waiting. It is very nice to walk on the glass floor and have a view from there. After that we went to the rooftop for an even better view of Paris. We wanted to visit the restaurant but with that one we had less luck as  it was full. But there were some beach chairs we could use to enjoy the view. We walked around inside as well and really enjoyed the experience."

The publication of Victor Hugo’s novel “The Hunchback of Notre-Dame” in 1831 renewed interest in preserving what by then had become little more than a rundown landmark. Even the iconic wooden spire was a later addition, having been added in 1859. At the time of the fire, a five-year goal was set for the restoration of the cathredral. Given that it took almost 200 years to build, some thought that two or three times that number might be needed. But now, an opening date of December 7 has been officially announced, just a month away—although further work will continue for another year or two. These pictures, which were taken on a misty Sunday in October, show how much has been done—and still to be completed."

It is full of museums, trendy boutiques, galleries and bars, some of which are gay. \nIt also used to contain the Jewish quarter of the city. This district is still home to many kosher restaurants.\nAnother iconic site is the Place des Vosges, verdant, which houses elegant arcades and the Victor Hugo museum, where the writer lived. \nThe streets around the Saint-Paul metro station lead to the Maison Européenne de la Photographie but you have not less intersting museums such as Les Archives Nationales and Le Musee Carnavalet, ideal for rainy days.\n\nBut actually if we forget the trendy aspect of the Marais, I love it for its narrow streets and its Louis XIII architecture which takes me back to the history of Paris."

The queue for check in was over an hour - we were slightly early and were told to either pay $50 for early check in or join the queue again. There was an automatic check in machine but it wasn't working. There was only 3 clerks on, and the queue was out of the reception and into the casino.We were celebrating our 41st wedding anniversary and asked if an upgrade was possible and the clerk literally snorted and laughed at us.  I said that I didn't expect that response, she told us that the staff were not allowed to arrange upgrades, and she was fed up of people asking, and she was thinking of just walking out, and how stressed and understaffed they were, and her manager didn't care. We paid for the early check in, just so we didn't have to queue again. It certainly put a dampener on our visit.The room was dated but OK, but no tea or coffee making facilities. We asked if we could get a kettle and were told that no rooms have that facility any more. $8 for a cup of very weak tea was a bit excessive, I thought, and when I asked for another tea bag as it was so weak, was asked for another $8! Lots of very drunk and noisy people coming back to their rooms during the night and shouting and slamming doors. There was a lot of mess in the corridors- dropped popcorn etc, and this was not cleared up. We visited lots of the other hotels, and none of them had such problems with checking in queues. We found the reception staff off hand and unfriendly, and the bar staff weren't much better. We ordered a coctkail for me and my husband asked for a whiskey. The barman asked which one, and my husband ordered one. \"That's a Scotch, not a whiskey says the barman\" - we giggled and said - oh that's what you call it over here- he very rudely replied that it was called Scotch everywhere, and you should know what you want to order and avoid me wasting my time having to explain things to you. This trip to Las Vegas was part of a special holiday and the visit to Paris Hotel was the lowest point in our trip. The customer care was much better in other hotels - we used the bars there. Go some where else"

We aren't high-rolling gamblers and that has a strong affect on how customers are treated.  Desk clerks are \"low talkers\", quickly making offers for upgrades if you pay extra, and if you decline, they're not very nice. Check in system is antiquated, one long line to see a clerk; we paid for early check in, but they wanted you to get back in the line when you're room is ready, instead of using the kiosks in the lobby.  Not sure why they aren't using modern technology. \n Best part - we paid the extra $80+tax for a lounger bed at the pool - it gave us a great afternoon, includes bottled waters, and the pool area is beautiful; staff at pool were very friendly.  Worst part - no coffee in the room and in the hotel restaurants, it's $9+ a cup!  That's ridiculous.  They have a fridge in the room, they could have coffee makers like every other hotel in the USA.  I signed up for Caesars Rewards and it proved to be useless, unless you're spending lots of money in the casino.  There is also a lot of construction in the area, so even the Bellagio fountains were partially obstructed."

There seems to be an inside job happening that you’d never suspect. The worst part is when I reported it to the front desk, they didn’t care at all. They made me wait and did nothing. Security was no help either. I asked them to check the cameras by the elevator to identify who went into my room, but they refused, saying it’s ‘confidential.’ I had a gut feeling something was off.\n\nSo please, if you’re going to Vegas, be extra careful. Bring additional locks because even if your door is locked, they can still open it with their own keys. So, PEOPLE, DO NOT stay at the Paris Hotel in Vegas. At first, the staff seems nice, but once you check in, you’re on your own. They don’t care about you, your comfort, or helping you in any way. I’m not just upset about my stolen backpack—this is a warning for others to know what’s really going on at Paris Hotel in Vegas. Even if you lock your door, they have their own key.\n\nI’m not going to stress over it anymore, but since they’re NOT helping me or even showing basic concern, I will make sure my story is heard. People need to know that this PARIS HOTEL IS NOT SAFE. These thieves are professionals, and it feels like they somehow knew exactly when I was alone in the room while my husband and brother-in-law were at a concert. How else would they know exactly where I put my backpack?\n\nI lost so many valuable and sentimental items: my wedding ring, a pearl ring with diamonds that was a graduation gift from my sister, and other precious jewelry with memories attached, plus my wallet, driver’s license, and credit cards. Yes, these are just things, and I’m thankful I’m safe and my dog is unharmed, but people need to know what’s happening at this Pais hotel. When will they take action—when someone gets hurt?\n\nMy triplet siblings and I came to Vegas to celebrate our 50th birthday early, arriving on Tuesday, September 17, 2024. Everything was great until our last day, Saturday, September 21,2024 our birthday. What a heartbreaking way to end our trip. 😢😔"

Paris moved us to another room on the same floor and we settled in.  Only to realize the sink would not provide Warm to Hot water until it was running for 10-15 minutes straight.   This is huge with more than one person in the room, and a complete waste of water.   Oddly enough, the shower would warm up in a normal manner.  Secondly, the TV would lose internet connectivity so often that we would give up on watching TV in the early morning or evening."

Today, you can walk down the spiral staircase and take a guided tour of the network of tunnels or explore it at your own pace. It's recommended to buy skip-the-line tickets online to avoid snaking lines. You can easily reach the Catacombs by hopping on the Paris Metro. – Tripadvisor",

Additionally, there are damp gravel pathways and it's fairly dim down there.  My 75 y/o father did not enjoy it due to these issues.  I think they are well spelled out before you enter, but it was a lot for him.\n\nThere is also a long underground walk from the entrance building to the first sites, so again not a good idea if you have limited mobility."

We explained we had just bought it with help from a staff member for the final journey we needed to make back to the Eurostar and asked if we could point her out. She stormed off and refused to let us point her out. When she returned she said the ticket office staff said no one helped!! They said they would call police which would raise the fine to €200. They were bullying and aggressive and it was very clear there was a genuine mistake as they had watched us the whole time buying the ticket and go through. \nWe will never visit Paris again and if you are going avoid the Metro - there is definately scamming there with tourists from the very people who should be looking out for you. What an awful way to treat tourists. Made me appreciate the UK and Londons underground staff. We were glad to be home and will not visit France again ever."

I had lived in Paris 30 years ago, but my wife and kids were new to the city.\n\nThe Paris Metro system is fantastic. If you are staying in the city you are probably less than 250m from an entrance into the Metro and your destination is equally close to a stop. If your destination is on the same line as your start location just follow the signs for that line - there will be 2 options, one for each direction, and the direction is indicated by the name of the last station in that direction. Sometimes they will also list out the stops in each direction, but not always. If its on a different line you will need to change - this involves getting off at a stop and following signs for the next line/direction you need to take. You won't have to leave the Metro system, so you don't need a second ticket. \nWe used the phone app Bonjour RATP to see the best route (including transfers). I would suggest practice using this app before you go if you are new to subway systems.\n\nWe used paper tickets as we didn't know how much we'd use the Metro, but a Navigo Easy card each preloaded with tickets would have been cheaper and simpler. There are other options such as day passes etc. The paper tickets we bought were called t+ tickets and they cover any journeys within the metro system except to Orly Airport.\n\nHang on to your ticket until you leave the Metro system! Twice we had to use the same ticket twice as there was a second set of turnstiles for some reason. Also, while we didn't see any ticket inspectors, they do check tickets and you'll be fined if you have thrown your ticket away.\n\nA few words of warning:\n\nTake precautions against pick pockets - they will target tourists and its hard to look like a local! Carriages can be crowded so valuables need to be well secured. We didn't see any pickpockets, but there were warnings everywhere. I also bought any tickets in Republique rather than the more touristy stations.\n\nWe took the Metro from Universite Saint Denis to Republic and back as we arrived on the bus from Beauvais airport. I felt it was quite challenging travelling as a family with suitcases in rush hour. We had to manoeuvre to make sure we were near the carriage doors so we could get out in time (Parisiens are impressively polite though!) If the kids were younger I would have looked into another form of transportation for this journey.\n\nThe system is old, and unlike more modern systems it doesn't seem very accessible. If you are unable to use stairs then do your research before travelling - while some stations have lifts I didn't see many.\n\nSome Metro journeys involve quite a bit of walking within the system (to/from platforms, between lines etc)\n\nSome trains are very busy - so you'll find yourself quite squashed in. The longest wait time we saw was 4 minutes though, so if you are concerned about a train being excessively full, then wait for the next one.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall we took 12 journeys on the Metro in 3.5 days, most journeys took less than 20 minutes. We stayed in Republique, which has a number of lines, so most journeys didn't need a transfer. We packed loads into our trip to Paris and there is no way we could have seen and done as much without such an efficient form of transportation, and the kids really enjoyed the novelty of it."

As a result there is no natural light coming into the hotel. When we arrived security had to come out and get us as they obviously saw we could not find the entrance. We didn't enjoy our stay as it felt dark and pokey."

Staff were friendly and helpful, sights were great and loved the extra stop by the Eiffel Tower.  There was a five course meal served with wine which included tuna, fish, beef, cheese and desert.  Tips: book in advance especially in busy times, you might need to request a non alcoholic or soft drink (outside of water) as these are not always served as standard, if you run out of wine we were able to request more, staying on after the small break stop is a must because this is when you will get the Eiffel Tower experience."

The poached egg starter and strawberry dessert were good but everything in between was not that great, especially the fish and duck. The duck was overcooked and the fish wasn’t seasoned well. I had just left the Loire Valley and ate at some amazing restaurants and this just didn’t even compare. The wine was also poor. There was a couple seated behind us and I heard the gentleman telling the wait staff that the only good thing was the bread and he told them he didn’t even want the duck brought to the table because the food had been so poor. It is a very jerky experience and I gave up trying to figure out what I was looking at, as my information wasn’t loading. This was a very overpriced, underwhelming experience and I wouldn’t repeat it. It was extremely disappointing to stop at Invalides for pictures, instead of outside the Eiffel Tower."

The rooms were SO hot and humid ALL THE TIME and the AC wouldn’t work and the windows won’t open fully. \nThirdly, the beds were incredibly uncomfortable and the pillows didn’t support our necks at all - we all woke up with sore necks and backs the next morning with barely any sleep. \nFourthly, everything was VERY overpriced- 3€ for 500ml of water?? MAD. And 7.50€ to rent a towel?? HELLO??? \nI could name incidents that occurred when I stayed but I feel I could get into trouble if I mention them. But AVOID THIS HOSTEL AT ALL COST!!"

And the price was pretty good but the location isn't so great. To be polite, it's not in a great area, so usually when I got up for the day I would immediately take the metro and head towards more central Paris to find a cafe or something. (Though the metro is extremely close so that was nice!) They do have luggage storage you can pay for, but it's easier to just keep it in your room (in my opinion). And I had 2 giant pieces of luggages which I was able to just put in the corner of the room and had no issues. (And then I put my backpack and whatnot in the storage under the bed.) \n\nThe room was clean but just seemed like it wasn't super well maintained. I only say that because it seemed the window was broken and there was a temporary sign saying not to open it. (So the room would sometimes get a little stuffy/warm since we couldn't let any fresh air in.) And the hinges on my storage container under the bed were broken. Minor things of course, but worth mentioning. \n\nI had great experiences with the people I had in my room, they were all very friendly and I even spent a couple days walking around Paris with a couple of them! No issues at all with it being a mixed dorm. (I liked to refer to them as my \"temporary friends\" bc we would chat and hang out in Paris for a few days and then one of us would check out of the hostel and have to say goodbye lol.) \n\nAnd the staff were very lovely and helpful and are happy to help in English or French.\n\nOverall I had a pleasant stay, but I just wanted to be honest about some of the negative points that I didn't see in other reviews before I booked.
