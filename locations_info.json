Staff were friendly and helpful, sights were great and loved the extra stop by the Eiffel Tower.  There was a five course meal served with wine which included tuna, fish, beef, cheese and desert.  Tips: book in advance especially in busy times, you might need to request a non alcoholic or soft drink (outside of water) as these are not always served as standard, if you run out of wine we were able to request more, staying on after the small break stop is a must because this is when you will get the Eiffel Tower experience."

The poached egg starter and strawberry dessert were good but everything in between was not that great, especially the fish and duck. The duck was overcooked and the fish wasn’t seasoned well. I had just left the Loire Valley and ate at some amazing restaurants and this just didn’t even compare. The wine was also poor. There was a couple seated behind us and I heard the gentleman telling the wait staff that the only good thing was the bread and he told them he didn’t even want the duck brought to the table because the food had been so poor. It is a very jerky experience and I gave up trying to figure out what I was looking at, as my information wasn’t loading. This was a very overpriced, underwhelming experience and I wouldn’t repeat it. It was extremely disappointing to stop at Invalides for pictures, instead of outside the Eiffel Tower."

Pork chop arrived seared and raw when it was ordered well done.\nThe music was completely inappropriate for this kind of venue. It was more like a lobby of a cheap hotel.A last  comment… not the fault of the restaurant, but most of the clientele at lunch today were Chinese. They were very loud and rude, making TikTok videos and face timing with loud volume, and encroaching on our personal dining space.\nAn obviously French couple came in for lunch, sat down, and immediately left because of all of the above.\n\nThis could be an awesome venue, but sadly it was a bad experience.\nI wish we had bought sandwiches from a deli."

I really would not waste your money there.\n\nWe were initially left standing at the entrance as our table wasn't ready.\nEventually (after about 10 minutes) we were led to an awful table next to the waiters 'slops' station (where all the dirty plates and left over food are stacked). It was honestly the worst table in the restaurant.\nAs there were a number of other tables free, after a few minutes we stood up and asked to be moved. The waiter was incredibly rude to us as we swapped tables.\nHaving ordered an expensive bottle of Champagne it was frustrating that it was not bought to the table for a long time - in fact the starters were served before any drinks had arrived.\nThe main course was served cold. When I called the waiter over to say that the food was cold, I was told that 'that was the custom'. It obviously wasn't, and I left the meal. Nobody questioned why the food was left and the full meal was charged.\n\nParis has far too many fabulous restaurants to waste your time and money here. It really was awful."

The ambiance outside is definitely one of the highlights. However, the indoor dining area is quite underwhelming and lacks the charm you’d expect from a place like this.\nUnfortunately, the food was very disappointing. The pasta was nearly inedible — overcooked and chewy, like chewing gum. When we requested to switch to spaghetti, we were told no. My daughter also struggled with her meal, and her second dish was ruined by an overwhelming amount of garlic. Most of our group couldn’t finish their meals due to poor quality. The house rosé and white wine were equally subpar, leaving us all unimpressed.\nService was another low point. The restaurant was extremely busy, and it felt like the goal was to rush people in and out. We had to queue both to enter and leave via a tiny, 4-person lift, which was frustrating and unacceptable for a restaurant of this caliber. Our waiter was somewhat surly and not accommodating, particularly when we expressed dissatisfaction with the wine.\nWhile the outdoor area with its view of the Eiffel Tower is truly beautiful, the rest of the experience left a lot to be desired. Inside, the ambiance is nothing special, and overall, the restaurant doesn’t have a welcoming or “can-do” attitude.\nThe view is spectacular, but the rest of the experience at Gigi falls flat. Poor food quality, lackluster service, and an overall rushed feeling make it a place I wouldn’t return to. There are plenty of great dining options in Paris with a view of the Eiffel Tower, and sadly, this isn’t one of them.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’d like to adjust anything!"

The waiter said it was his fault and I should have asked but when i paid he also forced me to give a tip of either 10% or 20% there was no otheroption and quite frankly the waiter was making it embarrassing for us for asking about the wine cost. No where else in either Barcelona or Parisd did this occur and we ate at Michelin rated restaurants multiple times. Beware of the bait and swtich here but enjoy the ambiance.

We stopped to take photos of it's charming facade when a man offered to take some for us, with us in them. Turns out it was the owner, and he offered us a peek inside the very historic building. Wow what a gobsmacker!\nWe booked for dinner and were treated to sensational meals around oddly shaped tables (which is great) downstairs.  It is a 'choose your own' cellar, so my husband went and picked what he wanted.   It is a VERY old building so don't ex[pect large open spaces or modern decor.  It was wonky, charming, and decorated to the max in florid french style.  Gorgeous.   I absolutely loved it.  The food was great, but the atmosphere and the fun and rambunctious owner really made the atmosphere the stand out.   People talk together, over tables, sit at tables together, or separately, it's very 'as you see it'.   Prices are medium high, as you would expect.  it was our 30th Wedding anniversary, and we couldn't have picked better.\nTo top it off, a wonderful young man who was part of the Notre Dame choir, and in furlow until Notre Dame is open again, sang some beautiful french songs unaccompanied for the patrons at the restaurant.  Hauntingly beuatiful, it was just enchanting and his voice superb.  We will never forget the singer, and are really grateful he allowed us all to hear him sing, between his food courses!!\nWonderful.   REcommend.\nThankyou, Monsieur for your hospitality."

The owner is friendly and gently mocked my Englishness – A good start. There is no wine list – You go to the cellar and choose your own bottle – Starting from 25 Euros – Much cheaper that in the UK.\nThe owner told me what to have and it was the Best Beef Bourguignon I have experienced – And I make it myself! My companions had the pork medallions - pretty, moist and flavoursome and Confit du canard – falling off the bone and rich.\nWe started with snails – My only criticism was the snail wranglers were not quite fit for purpose so extracting our garlicy friends was a bit of a challenge.\nWe shared deserts – The chocolate bombe – spot on, and their version of Tart Tartine – more like a slice of apple pizza with flaky pastry – Light, crisp and subtly wonderful.\nThis is not a tourist restaurant.\nAnd later – SINGING by the piano as the diners gathered around and joined in. So special.\nRecommended for real and romantic people. Don’t go if you are a perfectionist or a cynic."

Honestly, save your money and go to McDonald’s because it’s a lot better. \n\nThis would be fine, if the bill didn’t come to €103 for two pasta dishes and two drinks 😟\n\nThe customer service wasn’t anything out of the ordinary, wasn’t good, wasn’t bad either. \n\nAlso, I suppose it doesn’t have anything to do with the restaurant itself, but a man attempted to mug me right outside of the restaurant and then walked into the restaurant to be served."

However, when I arrived at the hotel -on my wedding day- I was informed that my reservation had been canceled. I did not receive any cancellation notice via email, which felt very weird. I had a makeup appointment at 5 PM, and until 4:45 PM, I was stuck on the lobby, trying to figure this out each out. It was incredibly distressing to stand in the hotel lobby, in tears and embarrassed, while all my guests were waiting. I was left with no choice but to rebook a room for over $900 of difference of the original price just to avoid missing my own wedding. And then I was told by Booking that they did not cancel ANYTHING, they are not allowed to do it without the costumer authorization and clearly it was not the case.  Do NOT stay in this hotel!!"

We had a room very near the top floor with a great view of the Eiffel Tower.  \n\nThe room has been newly renovated and was quite nice.  The room was quite large and spacious. The bed and pillows were comfortable.  There was not a mini fridge but they provided one for us.  There is a mini bar with items for purchase! \n\nThe bathroom was also nicely remodelled. Of note, and I hope that CET takes note, there is no where in the shower to place your toiletries but on the base of the shower floor.  They really should rectify this.    The water pressure wasn't amazing but we always had more than enough hot water.\n\nHousekeeping was very nice and came on the days we requested. \n\nThe new skybridge connecting the new Versailles tower to Paris was opened. The area is beautiful imo.  If you are on the second level by the room elevators and walk to the Paris hotel through the skybridge, you can be on the casino floor in 3 minutes.  If you are coming from your room this would def be much quicker then walking into the Horseshoe casino and through the regular walk-way.  That wasn't a hindrance to us - it was quite quick.\n\nWe were dropped off and checked in at the Horseshoe. This was very quick and easy. We also had no issues using their diamond lounge.\n\nI will be honest, I think they should have left the tower with Horseshoe, but the remodel was very nice and if you like Horseshoe, it's like you are staying there :)\n\nWould 100% stay here again."

We had been out walking all day and weren’t wearing head to toe fur coats or carrying Louis Vuitton bags, so he clearly knew we weren’t good enough to be in the building and wanted to make sure to keep out the riffraff.\n\nPlenty of other people walked by without his comment, their noses in the air, and that of course was no problem to the doorman because those people clearly belonged. It’s ironic that a space that ought to exist to make people feel welcome instead does the opposite. Stuffy, “exclusive” Parisian hotel culture at its worst."

Every staff member that I encountered was professional but friendly and made me feel quite welcomed. \n\nOne of the great perks of a stay at the Ritz is that your room is ready when you arrive, regardless of the time (as long as you let them know your arrival time in advance).  Many flights from the US arrive quite early in the morning, so this was a huge plus for me. It is also possible to delay check out until 3 pm on your day of departure. \n\nI have already booked a second stay for January 2025"

The staff were incredibly attentive to us, from the moment we arrived with the help of the bellboy to the young woman at reception (Helena, I believe) who checked us in. Everything was perfect. The highlight was the concierge, Fabrice, who assisted us when we had an issue with our flight tickets. He took a lot of time to help us, and it truly saved the rest of our trip – thank you! The hotel is undergoing some construction on the ground floor, but it didn't affect our stay as we weren’t disturbed in our room, and the staff were so kind that we didn’t mind at all. The location is very central, allowing us to get everywhere quickly. It was a fantastic experience, and we will definitely return here every time we visit Paris!"

As a result there is no natural light coming into the hotel. When we arrived security had to come out and get us as they obviously saw we could not find the entrance.

Everything and I mean everything about this place is great it's beautiful, it's a great location to see all the sites and the staff is as friendly as you could imagine. We went for our anniversary and boy did they treat us great... roses, candles, and chocolates it couldn't have been nicer . We'll be staying here every single time we go to Paris no need to look for anything else!"

The Peninsula is well stated elegance and cool and calm and serene with just enough edge of excitement.  The rooms are very nice and well supported by the technology that is part of their now standard array (we were at the new Peninsula in Istanbul in August and will provide a separate review). We were met at the door by Rana Martin form guest services and escorted to our room. The suite was nice and well appointed and very comfortable. A lovely selection of fruit and macrons awaited us and the flowers and appointments in the room were lovely and very proper and home. Rana is a gem in all respects.\n\nThe hallmark of The Peninsula has become its persons. Everyone greets you with a welcoming smile and treats you as an honored guest. The entire Concierge staff assisted with our flowers for our room and our challenging requests for restaurant reservations. This was handled by the entire team including Jeremie and Célia and Clotilde and Christophe (the entire very large and capable team is always happy and eager to be of assistance!). Pro traveler tip: get the WhatsApp contact to the Concierge Team and make your asks in real time and enjoy immediate and professional support before and during your stay. The service levels they provide are exactly why one stays at The Peninsula as they do everything with a smile and sense of pride that enhances the experience.\n\nWe caught up on much needed sleep at the hotel during our stay. It has been a long time since we traveled without our wonderful kids and the peace and quiet were spectacular. We enjoyed excellent room service breakfast daily and appreciated the highest quality linens and bedding and bath products. \n\nThank you to the entire staff from front of house to housekeeping for a wonderful stay."

I had chosen to go to the lobby while waiting for a friend, with the intention of having a drink right after. To my great surprise, I was simply “kicked out” of the lobby under the pretext that I was not drinking immediately and that I was not expecting anyone residing at the hotel.\nPeople ask me who exactly I'm waiting for, what an indiscretion!\nI have never been treated in such a humiliating manner in an establishment of this magnitude. I have gone very often to have breakfasts and even lunches in this establishment where I will never return, I will obviously tell my experience to other people around me\nA man named SAÏD (I wonder how he was able to obtain such a position in charge of security) was arrogant, indelicate and disrespectful. I was made to feel like an unwanted intruder, even though I was planning to spend money at the hotel.\nThis behavior is unbecoming of a hotel of this reputation, and I strongly advise anyone not to go there if you expect a minimum of courtesy and professionalism. There are many other establishments in Paris that know how to treat their customers with respect and consideration, which is clearly not the case here.\nAbsolutely not worthy of a palace!"

The last version  was  that Euro 250, is not enough to cover the purchase of a couple of croissant. It only covers the cleaning fee, should you decide to smoke in a non smoking room. \nNeedless to say that had they asked for more deposit, I would have happily obliged.\nUpon entering the room, we noticed the safe was locked since previous guest, so we had to call security.\nWe woke up in the middle of the night, suffering from jet lag and decided to make a cup of tea. Unfortunately, tea bags had not been replenished since previous guest.\nI decided instead to read in bed, this is when I noticed the bed lamp, above bedside, heavily covered in dust.\nSpoke to a manager upon check out, but still feel very disappointed.\nThis is our 6th stay at the hotel, the last one being last July. We still love the hotel, the location and the brand. Not sure what happened since our last stay, but the service has dropped to what is now an unacceptably low level.

It has a huge fabulous morning breakfast buffet (also common in a good European hotel) . It’s recognizable across the city scape as it’s the only tall building in that area. The metro (Porte Maillot)  is a block away from that Hyatt.   We did metro most of the time and a few times an Uber (never a taxi) when I was just too tired or for timing.  On our first day we had an “over view of Paris tour”. It included how to use the metro, buy tickets,  read that “spaghetti map” a walk around Notre Dame area and lots of helpful tips on having a great experience while touring Paris! It included  city etiquette-like how to read a restaurant, do I just sit down or ask for a table, tipping etc!  It was so helpful. This hotel is connect s to a true shopping mall (came in handy when we needed cold meds) and a convention center.  The new rail car system stop is a half block away, and  was being tested pre Olympics when we were there in March.  The hotel has bamboo keys and smart elevators. We did have a view of the tower from our room!  We did not select this hotel, it was part of a Paris to Normandy Viking cruise, and we were very happy there!"

The was a Sunday Morning Market under the train railway. We were so excited as that was the best way to see the local life and experience the local delicacy. \n\nMy room was upgraded and was located at the corner, can enjoy the Eiffel Tower view at the living room. The living room is spacious. We also have a mini kitchenette too. So convenient to cook/reheat the food as there are stoves and microwave oven.\n\nI love the water and coffee/tea dispenser machines at the lobby. Unlimited coffee/tea, hot chocolate, still & sparkling water are available 24hours. \n\nThe lobby is not very big but it is cozy & modern + clean. You need to have keycard to access to the entrance from outside. Same goes to the guest floors access with keycard only for safety control.\n\nWhen the train passing by, the vibration will notify you for every trip as the train railway just next to the hotel.\n\nThe whole staying experience can be enhanced further if we could feel the warm service + more cheerful smile to make us at ease, especially when we are travelling to a foreign country that we are not familiar with the local language, culture and environment. \n\nWarm service + friendly smile can earn another 2 stars to perfection for this stay!"

The complimentary coffee downstairs didn’t have sugar almost all the time. The TV doesn’t have the option to mirror my cell screen, it is an important feature nowadays."

The front desk attendants were always courteous, patient and helpful (yes, they all spoke English). Our room was clean and comfortable. Very spacious. We didn't chose a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower, which turned out to be a good choice for us  because once you leave the hotel, the Tower is in view from practically everywhere. A few quirks to be aware of; the key card needs to stay inserted in the room for the lights to work, and you must tap the key card to the motion sensor in the elevator or it won't go anywhere. Hopefully this tip will help others avoid our fate, which was to look like complete American idiots, pushing the button repeatedly to no avail until someone from the desk came to rescue us.  Our room was very quiet. There is an overhead train directly across the street. We could barely hear it, but we were on the other side of the building. I don't know if it is loud from the Eiffel-facing rooms. Of course, this was wonderful for getting around, as the Metro station is right across the street. There are a host of restaurants and shops in the neighborhood and the Eiffel Tower is within easy walking distance. Our only substantive criticism is that the air conditioning didn't keep the room very cool. It was in the 80's and humid during our stay, and the room was quite warm even with the air turned to the coldest setting. I imagine we'll have to get used to other countries being more energy conscious than the U.S. Overall, I would highly recommend Citadines Tour Eiffel!"

My husband fell really sick on the 3rd night of the stay, and the front desk staff really tried their best to contact a local doctor to come over to the hotel (though unsuccessful), but they were prepared to send my husband to the nearest hospital if he needed. Applaud for the professionalism and the readiness to such medical emergencies. \n\nThe hotel was also really sweet to give us a bottle of champagne, Cake & a sweet card to celebrate our anniversary! \n\nHowever, 1 thing to note was the poor room service. We had to ask for refill of amenities daily, which took really long each time to reach the room. and it got pretty frustrating, especially on nights when we were back from a long day. This was the main factor that contributed to what I felt was a average stay. To be also fair to the team, other than the amenities portion, the room is kept clean. \n\nOther than that, the hotel location is awesome. Right beside a couple of yummy cafes, Metro, and really close to the Eiffel Tower! There's also a little convenience store just right around the corner which we could also conveniently get ourselves little snacks. "

Its a bit away (30min walk) from Elysees but the walking way is along Seine is very nice/quite and plenty of things to discover about Paris. With taxi max 10min driving. But if you are fan of Eiffel - its the best location. From hotel to trocadero 10min nice walking way with perfect view.\nStaff - Very helpfull. Especially Sarah GR manager and Stolic Tea who helped a lot. \nRoom Size - I had deluxe room with balcony. Amazing room with Eiffel view and Size is perfect. You can relax there. \nEntertainment - No need to go outside for nice PAris evening - at least 2 nights. 1 nigt you can spend at top roof restaurant and enjoy Eiffel nioght view. and 2nd night in lobby restaurant where superb DJ is playing with cozy atmoshphere. Other nights you can go out ))\nThe only improvement area - in Deluxe room its not good to have  2 twin beds combined as King Bed)). Despite it did not affect lot, King bed itself makes big difference compare dto 2 twin beds combined as KING :)\nThanks Hotel team for their help in making my 5day trip to Paris relaxing and enjoyiable.

Visited on a hot summer day in July. As we rented a house in Esbly we were only 8 minutes away. We arrived before 10.00 and passing security and the entrance went smoothly. Then the wait started. You can see in the app and per attraction what the waiting time is. 1 - 2 hours of waiting is no exception. The park is nice and the attractions are great but waiting 2 hours for a 2 minute ride is not funny. We were with teenagers and focused on the rollercoasters but also did 'it's a small world', Alice's Curious Labyrinth, Autopia and the railroad. It was nice to sit for a while in a cool place during Mickey’s PhilharMagic. We have seen and experienced it and we don't think about it to come back. The hot temperature and long waiting lines aren't worth it. The price (we paid almost USD 80 per person with a Family and Friends ticket) is also not attractive to try it another time. Restaurants, food stands, and souvenir shops are also extremely expensive, but they think they can justify it because it's Disney. The crew we interacted with is also not friendly and looks stressed but what you imagine with these big crowds? When we wanted to fill our water bottles (they have some water fountains) a lady started shouting to us because it was the area for the disabled people to watch the parade. Way too much stress. We have seen it, it was a nice experience, but the long lines, high price and stressed crew doesn't attract us to come back."

Maybe princesses (especially since for Princess Pavilion you have to wait so long in line and then meet whatever comes your way), fairies, no Frozen characters or shows available\n- some sort of virtual queues would be nice"

The history of the Catacombs dates back to the late 18th century when the city's cemeteries were closed due to health reasons and its contents were moved to an underground site. Today, you can walk down the spiral staircase and take a guided tour of the network of tunnels or explore it at your own pace. It's recommended to buy skip-the-line tickets online to avoid snaking lines. You can easily reach the Catacombs by hopping on the Paris Metro. – Tripadvisor",

And it was very convenient for me to travel from the hotel in the outskirts of the city (Gallieni) to different parts of Central Paris (including the Eiffel Tower, Trocadéro Square & Louvre Museum. The services were relatively frequent (at least every 4-5 minutes at peak times), it covers most areas of the cities with a dense coverage in Central Paris, the trains were relatively quick - even with older trains being used in Line 3, some of the modern lines are automated with cab/front views and have platform edge/screen doors, station spacing was relatively close without long distances (compared to parts of the London Underground), and they are also integrated with the RER Trains, buses and even trams (although I didn't ride the trams) - to which I can say Paris has an amazing public transport network on the whole (possibly one of the best in the world with its different modes).\n\nHowever, my only issues with the Paris Metro was that accessibility in the older lines wasn't great as most of the old Metro stations didn't have lifts, escalators or level boarding with the trains (wasn't a major issue for me, but would be trouble for disabled and older people alongside people with heavy luggage/loads), the train reliability for Line 3 was variable (most of the time it was fine, but on the last day, there was a signal failure which really slowed down train speed & operations) and a few older stations looked a bit worn out & in need of better maintenance. I also thought it was a little bit weird that a few lines had rubber-tyred tracks although those lines were thankfully quite quick & reliable. But apart from those, the Paris Metro on the whole was very convenient for me."

As tourists with two minors, we were abruptly and disproportionately approached by four \"metro agents\". They demanded our tickets and, upon not finding one (which had been lost during the trip), accused us of fraud. Despite showing the purchase receipt and explaining that we had just arrived that morning, they ignored us and fined us (50 euros). This experience was very traumatic and left a bitter taste in our mouths, ruining what was supposed to be a short two-day trip. We felt a great sense of injustice. How many other people have gone through something similar? Paris is an empty shell without tourism and this is yet another demonstration of how badly the city treats those who keep it alive. -- Le mois dernier, notre famille a vécu une expérience terrible dans le métro parisien. En tant que touristes avec deux mineurs, nous avons été abordés de manière brutale et disproportionnée par quatre \"agents de métro\". Ils ont exigé nos billets et, n'en trouvant pas un (qui avait été perdu pendant le voyage), nous ont accusés de fraude. Malgré la présentation du reçu d'achat et l'explication que nous venions d'arriver ce matin-là, ils nous ont ignorés et nous ont infligé une amende de 50 euros. Cette expérience a été très traumatisante et nous a laissé un goût amer, gâchant ce qui devait être un court séjour de deux jours. Nous avons ressenti un profond sentiment d'injustice. Combien d'autres personnes ont vécu une expérience similaire ? Paris est une coquille vide sans le tourisme et c'est une nouvelle démonstration de la façon dont la ville traite mal ceux qui la font vivre."

However, the ticket they gave us wouldn’t validate. When I went back to the staff for help, they told me to join the line again, even though it was super long and we were running late.\n\nI politely asked for assistance again, but instead of helping, the staff started using foul language. I was with my sister, and we didn’t have time to argue, so I just let it go. In the end, they opened the gate for us, but it was a terrible experience.\n\nI wouldn’t recommend using the metro if you’re short on time. The staff was rude and unhelpful, and honestly, it didn’t feel safe. It’s disappointing that behavior like this goes unchecked."

Just after going through we were surrounded by 3 guards aggressively wanting to check tickets. When my partners was said to be 'invalid' as if it had not gone through the barrier they demanded a €60 fine - no discussion. We explained we had just bought it with help from a staff member for the final journey we needed to make back to the Eurostar and asked if we could point her out. She stormed off and refused to let us point her out. When she returned she said the ticket office staff said no one helped!! They said they would call police which would raise the fine to €200. They were bullying and aggressive and it was very clear there was a genuine mistake as they had watched us the whole time buying the ticket and go through. \nWe will never visit Paris again and if you are going avoid the Metro - there is definately scamming there with tourists from the very people who should be looking out for you. What an awful way to treat tourists. Made me appreciate the UK and Londons underground staff. We were glad to be home and will not visit France again ever."

                        "review_text": "Just back from a 3 night stay in Paris with 2 children aged 14 and 12. I had lived in Paris 30 years ago, but my wife and kids were new to the city.\n\nThe Paris Metro system is fantastic. If you are staying in the city you are probably less than 250m from an entrance into the Metro and your destination is equally close to a stop. If your destination is on the same line as your start location just follow the signs for that line - there will be 2 options, one for each direction, and the direction is indicated by the name of the last station in that direction. Sometimes they will also list out the stops in each direction, but not always. If its on a different line you will need to change - this involves getting off at a stop and following signs for the next line/direction you need to take. You won't have to leave the Metro system, so you don't need a second ticket. \nWe used the phone app Bonjour RATP to see the best route (including transfers). I would suggest practice using this app before you go if you are new to subway systems.\n\nWe used paper tickets as we didn't know how much we'd use the Metro, but a Navigo Easy card each preloaded with tickets would have been cheaper and simpler. There are other options such as day passes etc. The paper tickets we bought were called t+ tickets and they cover any journeys within the metro system except to Orly Airport.\n\nHang on to your ticket until you leave the Metro system! Twice we had to use the same ticket twice as there was a second set of turnstiles for some reason. Also, while we didn't see any ticket inspectors, they do check tickets and you'll be fined if you have thrown your ticket away.\n\nA few words of warning:\n\nTake precautions against pick pockets - they will target tourists and its hard to look like a local! Carriages can be crowded so valuables need to be well secured. We didn't see any pickpockets, but there were warnings everywhere. I also bought any tickets in Republique rather than the more touristy stations.\n\nWe took the Metro from Universite Saint Denis to Republic and back as we arrived on the bus from Beauvais airport. I felt it was quite challenging travelling as a family with suitcases in rush hour. We had to manoeuvre to make sure we were near the carriage doors so we could get out in time (Parisiens are impressively polite though!) If the kids were younger I would have looked into another form of transportation for this journey.\n\nThe system is old, and unlike more modern systems it doesn't seem very accessible. If you are unable to use stairs then do your research before travelling - while some stations have lifts I didn't see many.\n\nSome Metro journeys involve quite a bit of walking within the system (to/from platforms, between lines etc)\n\nSome trains are very busy - so you'll find yourself quite squashed in. The longest wait time we saw was 4 minutes though, so if you are concerned about a train being excessively full, then wait for the next one.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall we took 12 journeys on the Metro in 3.5 days, most journeys took less than 20 minutes. We stayed in Republique, which has a number of lines, so most journeys didn't need a transfer. We packed loads into our trip to Paris and there is no way we could have seen and done as much without such an efficient form of transportation, and the kids really enjoyed the novelty of it."

Luckily the ladies in charge helped us to make the reservation on the spot and we could go without too much of waiting. It is very nice to walk on the glass floor and have a view from there. After that we went to the rooftop for an even better view of Paris. We wanted to visit the restaurant but with that one we had less luck as  it was full.

Outside the cathedral, you can admire its grand exterior which is framed by an elegant pair of bell towers, stained glass windows and an ornately decorated facade with grand statues. You can also enter the cathedral for a small entrance fee to view Nio-Gothic artwork and furniture as well as join their weekly sessions. – Tripadvisor",

The publication of Victor Hugo’s novel “The Hunchback of Notre-Dame” in 1831 renewed interest in preserving what by then had become little more than a rundown landmark. Even the iconic wooden spire was a later addition, having been added in 1859. At the time of the fire, a five-year goal was set for the restoration of the cathredral. Given that it took almost 200 years to build, some thought that two or three times that number might be needed. But now, an opening date of December 7 has been officially announced, just a month away—although further work will continue for another year or two. These pictures, which were taken on a misty Sunday in October, show how much has been done—and still to be completed."

This district is still home to many kosher restaurants.\nAnother iconic site is the Place des Vosges, verdant, which houses elegant arcades and the Victor Hugo museum, where the writer lived. \nThe streets around the Saint-Paul metro station lead to the Maison Européenne de la Photographie but you have not less intersting museums such as Les Archives Nationales and Le Musee Carnavalet, ideal for rainy days.\n\nBut actually if we forget the trendy aspect of the Marais, I love it for its narrow streets and its Louis XIII architecture which takes me back to the history of Paris."

Formula 1 setup slightly blocked our view, but we could still watch the Bellagio fountains from our room. The rest of the property is just as beautiful as the room with gorgeous restaurants - try Alexxas for brunch and snag the Cinnaroll Waffle. We even were offered an impromptu tour of the Eiffel Tower restaurant on our last day. Mobile checkout was even easier than checkin. I’ll definitely be staying here on our next trip to Las Vegas."

The queue for check in was over an hour - we were slightly early and were told to either pay $50 for early check in or join the queue again. There was an automatic check in machine but it wasn't working. There was only 3 clerks on, and the queue was out of the reception and into the casino.We were celebrating our 41st wedding anniversary and asked if an upgrade was possible and the clerk literally snorted and laughed at us.  I said that I didn't expect that response, she told us that the staff were not allowed to arrange upgrades, and she was fed up of people asking, and she was thinking of just walking out, and how stressed and understaffed they were, and her manager didn't care. We paid for the early check in, just so we didn't have to queue again. It certainly put a dampener on our visit.The room was dated but OK, but no tea or coffee making facilities. We asked if we could get a kettle and were told that no rooms have that facility any more. $8 for a cup of very weak tea was a bit excessive, I thought, and when I asked for another tea bag as it was so weak, was asked for another $8! Lots of very drunk and noisy people coming back to their rooms during the night and shouting and slamming doors. There was a lot of mess in the corridors- dropped popcorn etc, and this was not cleared up. We visited lots of the other hotels, and none of them had such problems with checking in queues. We found the reception staff off hand and unfriendly, and the bar staff weren't much better. We ordered a coctkail for me and my husband asked for a whiskey. The barman asked which one, and my husband ordered one. \"That's a Scotch, not a whiskey says the barman\" - we giggled and said - oh that's what you call it over here- he very rudely replied that it was called Scotch everywhere, and you should know what you want to order and avoid me wasting my time having to explain things to you. This trip to Las Vegas was part of a special holiday and the visit to Paris Hotel was the lowest point in our trip. The customer care was much better in other hotels - we used the bars there. Go some where else"

We were pleased that the waiter was good at checking what level spice/heat we wanted, something I like to have in an Indian restaurant. The onion bhajis were the best I have had in France, and the house special chicken dish I had with garlic and ginger was perfect. My Brummy mate (from the home of curry in England) loved his Madras and my third friend enjoyed his fish curry.\n\nI would have left a 5, but the poppadoms were a little uninspiring and the naans a little underdone and doughy, but that's a minor niggle"

Visited on a hot summer day in July. As we rented a house in Esbly we were only 8 minutes away. We arrived before 10.00 and passing security and the entrance went smoothly. Then the wait started. You can see in the app and per attraction what the waiting time is. 1 - 2 hours of waiting is no exception. The park is nice and the attractions are great but waiting 2 hours for a 2 minute ride is not funny. We were with teenagers and focused on the rollercoasters but also did 'it's a small world', Alice's Curious Labyrinth, Autopia and the railroad. It was nice to sit for a while in a cool place during Mickey’s PhilharMagic. We have seen and experienced it and we don't think about it to come back. The hot temperature and long waiting lines aren't worth it. The price (we paid almost USD 80 per person with a Family and Friends ticket) is also not attractive to try it another time. Restaurants, food stands, and souvenir shops are also extremely expensive, but they think they can justify it because it's Disney. The crew we interacted with is also not friendly and looks stressed but what you imagine with these big crowds? When we wanted to fill our water bottles (they have some water fountains) a lady started shouting to us because it was the area for the disabled people to watch the parade. Way too much stress. We have seen it, it was a nice experience, but the long lines, high price and stressed crew doesn't attract us to come back."

Maybe princesses (especially since for Princess Pavilion you have to wait so long in line and then meet whatever comes your way), fairies, no Frozen characters or shows available\n- some sort of virtual queues would be nice"

I was left with no choice but to rebook a room for over $900 of difference of the original price just to avoid missing my own wedding.

Of note, and I hope that CET takes note, there is no where in the shower to place your toiletries but on the base of the shower floor.  They really should rectify this.    The water pressure wasn't amazing but we always had more than enough hot water.\n\nHousekeeping was very nice and came on the days we requested. \n\nThe new skybridge connecting the new Versailles tower to Paris was opened. The area is beautiful imo.  If you are on the second level by the room elevators and walk to the Paris hotel through the skybridge, you can be on the casino floor in 3 minutes.  If you are coming from your room this would def be much quicker then walking into the Horseshoe casino and through the regular walk-way.  That wasn't a hindrance to us - it was quite quick.\n\nWe were dropped off and checked in at the Horseshoe. This was very quick and easy.

And it was very convenient for me to travel from the hotel in the outskirts of the city (Gallieni) to different parts of Central Paris (including the Eiffel Tower, Trocadéro Square & Louvre Museum. The services were relatively frequent (at least every 4-5 minutes at peak times), it covers most areas of the cities with a dense coverage in Central Paris, the trains were relatively quick - even with older trains being used in Line 3, some of the modern lines are automated with cab/front views and have platform edge/screen doors, station spacing was relatively close without long distances (compared to parts of the London Underground), and they are also integrated with the RER Trains, buses and even trams (although I didn't ride the trams) - to which I can say Paris has an amazing public transport network on the whole (possibly one of the best in the world with its different modes).\n\nHowever, my only issues with the Paris Metro was that accessibility in the older lines wasn't great as most of the old Metro stations didn't have lifts, escalators or level boarding with the trains (wasn't a major issue for me, but would be trouble for disabled and older people alongside people with heavy luggage/loads), the train reliability for Line 3 was variable (most of the time it was fine, but on the last day, there was a signal failure which really slowed down train speed & operations) and a few older stations looked a bit worn out & in need of better maintenance. I also thought it was a little bit weird that a few lines had rubber-tyred tracks although those lines were thankfully quite quick & reliable. But apart from those, the Paris Metro on the whole was very convenient for me."

Despite showing the purchase receipt and explaining that we had just arrived that morning, they ignored us and fined us (50 euros). This experience was very traumatic and left a bitter taste in our mouths, ruining what was supposed to be a short two-day trip. We felt a great sense of injustice. How many other people have gone through something similar? Paris is an empty shell without tourism and this is yet another demonstration of how badly the city treats those who keep it alive. -- Le mois dernier, notre famille a vécu une expérience terrible dans le métro parisien. En tant que touristes avec deux mineurs, nous avons été abordés de manière brutale et disproportionnée par quatre \"agents de métro\".

We explained we had just bought it with help from a staff member for the final journey we needed to make back to the Eurostar and asked if we could point her out. She stormed off and refused to let us point her out. When she returned she said the ticket office staff said no one helped!! They said they would call police which would raise the fine to €200. They were bullying and aggressive and it was very clear there was a genuine mistake as they had watched us the whole time buying the ticket and go through. \nWe will never visit Paris again and if you are going avoid the Metro - there is definately scamming there with tourists from the very people who should be looking out for you. What an awful way to treat tourists. Made me appreciate the UK and Londons underground staff. We were glad to be home and will not visit France again ever."

I had lived in Paris 30 years ago, but my wife and kids were new to the city.\n\nThe Paris Metro system is fantastic. If you are staying in the city you are probably less than 250m from an entrance into the Metro and your destination is equally close to a stop. If your destination is on the same line as your start location just follow the signs for that line - there will be 2 options, one for each direction, and the direction is indicated by the name of the last station in that direction. Sometimes they will also list out the stops in each direction, but not always. If its on a different line you will need to change - this involves getting off at a stop and following signs for the next line/direction you need to take. You won't have to leave the Metro system, so you don't need a second ticket. \nWe used the phone app Bonjour RATP to see the best route (including transfers). I would suggest practice using this app before you go if you are new to subway systems.\n\nWe used paper tickets as we didn't know how much we'd use the Metro, but a Navigo Easy card each preloaded with tickets would have been cheaper and simpler. There are other options such as day passes etc. The paper tickets we bought were called t+ tickets and they cover any journeys within the metro system except to Orly Airport.\n\nHang on to your ticket until you leave the Metro system! Twice we had to use the same ticket twice as there was a second set of turnstiles for some reason. Also, while we didn't see any ticket inspectors, they do check tickets and you'll be fined if you have thrown your ticket away.\n\nA few words of warning:\n\nTake precautions against pick pockets - they will target tourists and its hard to look like a local! Carriages can be crowded so valuables need to be well secured. We didn't see any pickpockets, but there were warnings everywhere. I also bought any tickets in Republique rather than the more touristy stations.\n\nWe took the Metro from Universite Saint Denis to Republic and back as we arrived on the bus from Beauvais airport. I felt it was quite challenging travelling as a family with suitcases in rush hour. We had to manoeuvre to make sure we were near the carriage doors so we could get out in time (Parisiens are impressively polite though!) If the kids were younger I would have looked into another form of transportation for this journey.\n\nThe system is old, and unlike more modern systems it doesn't seem very accessible. If you are unable to use stairs then do your research before travelling - while some stations have lifts I didn't see many.\n\nSome Metro journeys involve quite a bit of walking within the system (to/from platforms, between lines etc)\n\nSome trains are very busy - so you'll find yourself quite squashed in. The longest wait time we saw was 4 minutes though, so if you are concerned about a train being excessively full, then wait for the next one.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall we took 12 journeys on the Metro in 3.5 days, most journeys took less than 20 minutes. We stayed in Republique, which has a number of lines, so most journeys didn't need a transfer. We packed loads into our trip to Paris and there is no way we could have seen and done as much without such an efficient form of transportation, and the kids really enjoyed the novelty of it."

I had chosen to go to the lobby while waiting for a friend, with the intention of having a drink right after. To my great surprise, I was simply “kicked out” of the lobby under the pretext that I was not drinking immediately and that I was not expecting anyone residing at the hotel.\nPeople ask me who exactly I'm waiting for, what an indiscretion!\nI have never been treated in such a humiliating manner in an establishment of this magnitude. I have gone very often to have breakfasts and even lunches in this establishment where I will never return, I will obviously tell my experience to other people around me\nA man named SAÏD (I wonder how he was able to obtain such a position in charge of security) was arrogant, indelicate and disrespectful. I was made to feel like an unwanted intruder, even though I was planning to spend money at the hotel.\nThis behavior is unbecoming of a hotel of this reputation, and I strongly advise anyone not to go there if you expect a minimum of courtesy and professionalism. There are many other establishments in Paris that know how to treat their customers with respect and consideration, which is clearly not the case here.\nAbsolutely not worthy of a palace!"

Staff were friendly and helpful, sights were great and loved the extra stop by the Eiffel Tower.  There was a five course meal served with wine which included tuna, fish, beef, cheese and desert.  Tips: book in advance especially in busy times, you might need to request a non alcoholic or soft drink (outside of water) as these are not always served as standard, if you run out of wine we were able to request more, staying on after the small break stop is a must because this is when you will get the Eiffel Tower experience."

The poached egg starter and strawberry dessert were good but everything in between was not that great, especially the fish and duck. The duck was overcooked and the fish wasn’t seasoned well. I had just left the Loire Valley and ate at some amazing restaurants and this just didn’t even compare. The wine was also poor. There was a couple seated behind us and I heard the gentleman telling the wait staff that the only good thing was the bread and he told them he didn’t even want the duck brought to the table because the food had been so poor. It is a very jerky experience and I gave up trying to figure out what I was looking at, as my information wasn’t loading. This was a very overpriced, underwhelming experience and I wouldn’t repeat it. It was extremely disappointing to stop at Invalides for pictures, instead of outside the Eiffel Tower."

They bring lots of salads as starters ( on the house) and then you choose your kebab. Their lahmacun and Adana kebab are delicious.

Again in the morning we was met again with the same rude staff we left the hotel for the day as there's literally nothing available we wasn't made aware of the hotels pool/spa\nWe arrived later that evening and greeted by friendly lobby staff at tge security entrance then headed towards the elevator which is too the right of the reception staff where again the 3 members of extremely rude staff who saw us the night before was there we stepped into the lift and realised the card wasn't working that's why the lift wasn't working but instead of taking a few steps towards us and help us they shouted \" CARD NOT WORKING LADY COME HERE NOW\" infornt of people in the lobby it was  very intimidating I then walked to her she snatched the card and then just slammed it back on desk. \n\nFood was average I don't recommend the soup it's very oily \nThe electricity kept going out and back on was frustrating. \n\nIt's very very noisy even on the 8th floor\n\nYou can hear absolutely everything between rooms and every car pr bike driving past.\n\nFor such a expensive hotel I wouldn't recommend and I definitely wouldn't return\nThey wasn't so welcoming to the English visitors what a shame."

WiFi was quite problematic. I must admit I couldn’t get any connection from my room. That was annoying. Rooms were very clean. Breakfast was also not as expected from a 5 star hotel.

Despite it looking like a nice restaurant, the food on offer was just the same as that on offer in any ocakbaşı in Adana. The room was disapointingly empty but for us and another couple (and a big black fly that wouldn’t leave our table). A bottle of sweet dessert white wine was produced and shown to my husband (who doesn’t really drink wine) and served served in huge glasses. While we were still obviously eating our mezes, they were cleared away for our main course …mine chicken breast. With the first bite I started to burn up as it was overly spicy. The waiter removed it and a loud argument started in the kitchen with the chef saying that the guest should ask for the meal to not be spicy.  After 20 minutes, the replacement chicken came back but unbelievably salty. We paid 735tl and left. \n  PS..We sat by the window to the terrace where, apparently, the staff go to have a cigarette. \n PPS…this place obviously thinks that the actual room, decor and having a waiter pull out the lady’s chair is all that is required to charge a fortune for the experience. \nPPPS…during our time there, I used the restroom….it was difficult to find as it was in a dark hallway.  I had to enter a room to turn on the light after guessing it could be the ladies’ which it thankfully was. "

We learn from this video that there were always settlements in Adana, even before the Neolithic period. It was home to the Hittite and Kizzuwatna civilizations, Eastern Roman Empire, Selchuks, Ramazanogullari and the Ottoman Empire before the Republic of Turkey. The earliest signs of settlement date back to 10.000 BC. \n\nThe museum is not fully complete yet but there is a lot to see, from Neolithic objects to kitchen and dining utensils, rhytons, figurines, glass objects, jewelry, statues and busts, sarcophagi. \n\nOne of the most striking displays in the museum is the excellent mosaic section, which is huge and where you see the mosaics from a glass platform above. It is a little scary but there is no need to be afraid as modern technology was used here. \n\nThere is a small gift shop and a cafe downstairs. "

The museum opened its doors in May 2017. The galleries are converted long sheds with a new wing of mosaics to open in June 2018. Upon the entry to the galleries there is a short introductory film and a timeline beginning with Gobekli Tepe (10,000 years BC) to the Republican era 1923 till today.
