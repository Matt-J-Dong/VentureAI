A nice quirky little AI for generating some ideas if I ever want to travel somewhere in the future!
Looks pretty good, and I love the idea of using TripAdvisor. However, the weirdness of not printing the right money symbols for each location weirds me out a little.
I appreciated the detailed schedule, but the format was hard to read on my phone. A more compact or mobile-friendly version would improve usability.
Not having to Google all of the restaurants that the AI provides is wonderful and saves so much time.
a fun potential alternative to using ChatGPT when I go out
maybe you could try also adding in details about each restaurant's menu?
Knowing the price of each restaurant suggested is great, but there's no way for me to suggest a price point that I want.
are you going to create a website for this? i would love to use such a website when you do make one!
If you could add transportation information so I don't have to look that up while traveling as well, that would be a major help.
Some of the attractions are already well known attractions. I want some more stuff that I didn't know about before!
This might be extra because you should mostly only suggest highly rated places anyways, but could you maybe also show the rating of each place?
